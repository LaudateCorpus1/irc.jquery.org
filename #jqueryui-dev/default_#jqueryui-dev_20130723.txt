[02:00:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool, thanks
[02:01:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - do you remember why we made excludeInvisible an option instead of just exclude invisibles?
[03:48:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In case people want the "broken" corner look.
[03:49:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah must be it

[05:27:55] <uGoMobi> just hey and then quit? :/
[05:46:09] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hey!
[05:46:19] <frequent> morning
[05:46:41] <frequent> I saw your <form>-wrap and commented on it
[05:47:27] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, cool!
[05:47:32] * _|Nix|_ go read now
[05:49:27] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Great ... looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6192/commits is completely unhelpful for finding your comment :/
[05:49:27] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Pull request #6192 by gabrielschulhof (3d 23h ago): Filter widget review

[05:50:42] <b-ot> frequent: Pull request #6192 by gabrielschulhof (3d 23h ago): Filter widget review
[05:50:56] <_|Nix|_> frequent: If you want to use the input in a form, do not rely on the input generation. Instead, provide your own input via the input option.
[05:51:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: If you do that, it will generate no input.
[05:51:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... and no form.
[05:51:12] <frequent> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/903ad4385189802e5b3979ef400937e9246f5f58
[05:51:13] <b-ot> frequent: Gabriel Schulhof (19h 24m ago): Filterable: Wrap generated input into a form.
[05:51:22] <frequent> this was the commit I was referring to
[05:51:34] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Right. I have found your comment in the meantime.
[05:51:38] <frequent> ok
[05:52:52] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Basically, wrapping the generated input in a form is a guarantee that it will /not/ be submitted. That's by design. With this version, however, you do have the option of specifying data-input="#myInput" for the filterable and then it will use that for the filtering. If #myInput is then part of a form somewhere in the document, then it will be submitted whenever that form is submitted.
[05:53:25] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The overall thrust is to discourage the use of the generated input whenever possible.
[05:53:29] <frequent> I see. Nice guarantee :-)
[05:53:36] <frequent> Ok
[05:53:48] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... this is also why I moved the input generation code to the backcompat extension.
[05:54:06] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The basic idea is that we chop off the backcompat extension in 1.5.0.
[05:54:17] <frequent> ok
[05:54:43] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The listview divider autohide stuff will also be a separate extension, because there should be no widget-specific code inside filterable.
[05:55:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: filterable should basically be a glue widget between an input and an element's children.
[05:56:19] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. I need to check all your commits when I have a minute or two...
[05:56:28] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... and with the children option (which was present in your original PR under a different name) you can still retain the possibility of multiple data sets, while defaulting to the jQM-specific special selector.
[05:56:53] <frequent> cool
[05:57:07] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, and while you're here: Why did you do that hidequeue thing? Why not apply ui-screen-hidden directly?
[05:57:24] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Adding a class and later another causes two reflows. Adding the final class directly causes only one.
[05:57:25] <frequent> hm. that was in the original listview.filter extension
[05:57:32] <frequent> I just kept it for....
[05:57:32] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Oh, OK. Good.
[05:57:36] <frequent> no good reason I guess
[05:57:38] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Understood.
[05:57:48] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, it's gone now :)
[05:58:10] <frequent> nice work
[05:58:15] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... I also removed the assumption that entering more text will reduce the number of options. That may be true in general, but not always.
[05:58:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... depends on the filterCallback.
[06:00:20] <frequent> _|Nix|_: one comment on the table widget/refresh method:
[06:01:18] <frequent> Should we add a "rebuild" method callable next to "refresh". There were some users requesting refresh to also work with different columns
[06:01:47] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ... but for me most "refreshes" will be table pagination etc
[06:02:13] <frequent> so as long as you just swap rows, there is no real need to rebuild the columnpicker and rebuild the whole table
[06:02:22] <frequent> which is now being done on every "refresh" call
[06:02:50] <frequent> so "refresh" = only update rows, "rebuild" = update rows and columns (including rebuilding the columnpicker)
[06:03:27] <frequent> _|Nix|_: what do you think?
[06:11:35] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Well, we have something similar in custom select.
[06:12:29] <_|Nix|_> frequent: So, OK. Since we haven't had /any/ refresh-like method, we might as well do it like this.
[06:12:52] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You wanna add that while I do the autohide dividers extension?
[06:13:15] <frequent> _|Nix|_: if it has time until this evening, sure.
[06:13:56] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I think so.
[06:13:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^?
[06:14:06] <uGoMobi> hey
[06:14:17] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[06:14:26] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:14:41] * uGoMobi is reading
[06:19:31] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah tonight is fine if _|Nix|_ has time tomorrow morning to review
[06:20:25] <frequent> good. I can just pull master to get the latest version,  can I?
[06:20:59] <uGoMobi> uhh... did we merge the table branche(s) already? _|Nix|_ ?
[06:26:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: maybe best solution is to have the rebuild method call the refresh method and add a "rebuild" parameter to the refresh method
[06:26:35] <frequent> uGoMobi: that was my idea.
[06:26:40] <uGoMobi> ah ok :)
[06:26:57] <frequent> just a parameter to rebuild the colpicker yes/no
[06:27:31] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:27:47] <uGoMobi> how about refreshing just when rows are added?
[06:28:04] <frequent> hm. 
[06:28:08] <uGoMobi> do we need to do everything that's in refresh?
[06:28:25] <uGoMobi> or can that be improved a bit too?
[06:28:32] <frequent> I will have a look
[06:28:33] <uGoMobi> (haven't looked at current code)
[06:29:06] <agcolom> Hey Jasper :-) what can I do for you ;-) ?
[06:29:15] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom :)
[06:30:14] <frequent> uGoMobi: (me neither) ;-)
[06:30:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we have a lot of documentation to update for 1.4
[06:30:29] <agcolom> sure
[06:30:58] <agcolom> do we have list of what needs updating? (I've been off track for a few weeks)
[06:31:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was thinking we should port over anything that sounds like API documentation from demo center to API docs
[06:31:45] <agcolom> ok, I can have a look there and prepare a list...
[06:31:54] <uGoMobi> there are also still things in the old docs that aren't in the API docs yet
[06:32:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nah, there isn't really a list
[06:32:12] <agcolom> ok... 
[06:32:16] <uGoMobi> we should create tickets
[06:32:22] <agcolom> good idea.
[06:32:53] <uGoMobi> as soon as 1.4 alpha is out we have to go thru the changelog and open issues
[06:33:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: here is link to old docs http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/ 
[06:33:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you also made a Google doc once
[06:33:53] <agcolom> I had a quick chat with scott_gonzalez this morning. He will work on solving the resources folder issue as soon as he's finished with the plugins site issue
[06:33:58] <uGoMobi> I can give that a look again and maybe we can update it a bit so you have an overview
[06:34:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah that's awesome (thanks scott_gonzalez !)
[06:35:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we have add the changelog to blog posts and our supported platforms list is on the website... I'd like to move those
[06:36:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes I need to review that old google docs to check what else is missing...
[06:36:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: is this something we can add in the API docs?
[06:36:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, would be great to use your doc
[06:36:47] <agcolom> sorry?
[06:37:30] <agcolom> is this something we can add in the API docs? <- not sure what you meant here?
[06:37:46] <uGoMobi> the changelog and supported platforms list
[06:37:53] <agcolom> ah, ok
[06:37:55] <uGoMobi> supported platforms is version specific
[06:38:04] <agcolom> oh, yes, that's a good idea
[06:38:35] <uGoMobi> and changelog is very useful when upgrading so I wanted to give that a more permanent place than the blog post
[06:39:23] <agcolom> ok. Where would you see that go?
[06:39:30] <agcolom> see http://api.jquerymobile.com/ 
[06:39:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I dunno yet ;)
[06:39:41] <agcolom> :-)
[06:39:58] <agcolom> currently, we have a platform menu at the top... 
[06:40:09] <agcolom> but that would probably only show the latest
[06:40:15] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:40:38] <agcolom> so we could have a version specific one under a menu on the left hand-side
[06:40:58] <uGoMobi> let me check how UI does this
[06:40:59] <agcolom> and both could have links to each other
[06:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Changelog should go on jquerymobile.com, not api.jquerymobile.com
[06:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://jqueryui.com/changelog/
[06:42:09] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: right, I am looking UI's upgrade guides
[06:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/
[06:42:14] <agcolom> ^ I was talking about supported platforms
[06:43:24] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is the changelog written in markdown?
[06:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[06:43:43] <uGoMobi> and then just link to the changelof from the API docs
[06:44:34] <uGoMobi> that's what I find most important... that people can easily find the changelog and don't have to search in blog posts
[06:45:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: would be great if we can reorganize this for 1.4 final together with new WordPress site
[06:46:02] <agcolom> yes. What is the status with jquerymobile.com?
[06:46:31] <uGoMobi> still the same as last time we talked about it
[06:46:38] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: are you around?
[06:46:39] <agcolom> ok. 
[06:46:49] <agcolom> the changelogs are currently as blog posts?
[06:46:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[06:47:26] <agcolom> ok, so to get started, I could prepare the md files for the changelogs...
[06:47:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah that would be great
[06:48:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we will be using a tool to build the changelog and then clean it up manually
[06:48:52] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I guess I should find everything I need on github to see how to get the changelogs up? (I'll just follow what UI is doing...)?
[06:48:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when I know what the markdown needs to look like we can put that in the tool
[06:49:20] <agcolom> yes, it's really easy :-) just a series of lists.... 
[06:49:45] <agcolom> I'm guessing it's just like the meeting minutes format... 
[06:50:19] <melter> is there something wrong with themeroller? when i change something in a saved theme and tab off, it resets to a default theme
[06:50:54] <uGoMobi> melter: what version of JQM are you using in the ThemeRoller?
[06:51:21] <uGoMobi> or were you talking about UI?
[06:51:29] <melter> the jqueryui
[06:51:36] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so all we use really is ## for headings (## is h2, ### is h3, etc) then * for 1st level list item, spaces and - for sublists, etc...
[06:51:36] <uGoMobi> aha, sorry
[06:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> melter: I'm not seeing any problems.
[06:52:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: right, looks similar to github flavoured md
[06:52:18] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I would imagine
[06:52:26] <uGoMobi> just saying :)
[06:53:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the 1.4 alpha, beta and rc changelogs will still be in the blog posts
[06:53:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but we can test with them on stage
[06:53:47] <agcolom> yes, 
[06:54:06] <agcolom> Should I start with 1.3 changelogs?
[06:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: It is GFM.
[06:55:03] <uGoMobi> aha :)
[06:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> There are caveats.
[06:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> Like you can't do task lists.
[06:56:10] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:56:30] <melter> i've tried firefox, chrome, and opera with addons disabled, and i have the same problem in all of them
[06:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> melter: What are the exact steps you're following?
[06:57:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think the 1.3 changelog can wait
[06:57:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, frequent: I don't think we should add parameters to the refresh method.
[06:57:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I hope most people already upgraded to 1.3
[06:57:42] <agcolom> ok, so start with 1.4 alpha?
[06:57:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, frequent: Traditionally, it's just refresh()
[06:57:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Having multiple methods is not bad.
[06:58:07] <melter> 1. load existing theme; 2. change something; 3. tab off (or click on another field)
[06:58:41] <melter> i just noticed that while everything looks fine in the displays on the right, the actual values in the fields are all wrong.
[06:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> What's the existing theme?

[06:59:35] <_|Nix|_> frequent: You should pull from the branch "table-widget-review" and make a PR against that.
[06:59:44] <melter> it looks like whatever the default is when you first go to the site
[07:00:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am not ready with 1.4 alpha changelog yet, so for now just creating the page for changelog overview and a page where we can add the 1.4 final changelog will do
[07:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> melter: That's not helpful. What's the actual theme? Without that, I can't test it.
[07:00:04] <melter> my theme is one i saved about a month ago
[07:00:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How are we doing on branch merges for alpha?
[07:00:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, I've just cloned the repo and will try to play with it and see what happens :-)
[07:00:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok great, good luck :)

[07:01:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's check status of reviewing branches with arschmitz 
[07:01:23] <melter> is there a recommended paste site for this channel?
[07:01:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[07:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/ ?
[07:02:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: your done with flip right?
[07:02:08] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15iwavelets opened issue #6200: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined  02http://git.io/xjpqTA
[07:02:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[07:02:37] <arschmitz> so that is ready i just need to add some tests
[07:03:35] <arschmitz> ext panels your still working on right?
[07:03:46] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:03:54] <arschmitz> ok so thats still working
[07:04:06] <arschmitz> textinput and checkboxradio are merged already
[07:04:22] <uGoMobi> external panels will be my project rest of the day after some textinput CSS
[07:04:38] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok, thx for the repo to pull.
[07:04:39] <arschmitz> button i think is ready but want to double check all tests are passing
[07:05:12] <arschmitz> and autoinit im trying to finishup now
[07:05:21] <_|Nix|_> ... and controlgroup and collapsible should be good too.
[07:05:31] <arschmitz> just getting tests to pass
[07:05:48] <melter> scott_gonzalez: this is the theme i'm trying to modify: http://pastebin.com/Pruiwb2C
[07:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> melter: Ok, I'm seeing the issue with that URL.
[07:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: ^
[07:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> melter: As a workaround for now, try just refreshing the page after the preview looks right.
[07:07:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i noticed when working on autoinit this weekend there is still an initSelector in the options on controlgroup
[07:07:59] <arschmitz> from 1.3
[07:08:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz :https://docs.google.com/document/d/1prvpumXIlQSsiGHCBA_03iXrWuB6IR8mkEYSS5ps3Ag/edit#heading=h.crg760xoxv4
[07:08:22] <melter> scott_gonzalez: that works! thanks!
[07:08:22] <uGoMobi> useful as checklist
[07:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> melter: Are you on GitHub?
[07:08:56] <melter> scott_gonzalez: for the record, that's the url embedded in the jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.css file
[07:08:59] <melter> scott_gonzalez: yes
[07:09:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're right! What was the status of initselector again? Does your autoinit generate that and place it on both the proto and the ns?
[07:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> melter: Username?
[07:09:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unless you need something besides jqmData(role='widgetname') it should not be in the widget at all
[07:09:57] <arschmitz> it will be auto generated
[07:10:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool. I might have to yank that from other palces too, then.
[07:10:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dont worry about it execpt that option

[07:10:53] <arschmitz> i have have everything else in my branch because i need it to make tests pass
[07:11:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I might as well yank the call to the enhancer from controlgroup while I'm at it, and call ... wait ... what do I call on the child elements?
[07:12:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i already did all that in the branch
[07:12:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[07:12:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[07:12:22] <arschmitz> and you call the individual widgets if they exist
[07:12:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but what elements do I pass them?
[07:13:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just a sec ill show you how i do it
[07:13:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'm about to grab the autoinit branch.
[07:13:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, it's not there yet. OK. Then please show me!
[07:14:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've just noticed that mobile.com uses 'pages' folder, while ui.com uses a 'page' folder. does that matter?
[07:14:27] <agcolom> (api sites use 'pages')

[07:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> rworth and I disagree on what the folder should be called :-P
[07:15:04] <agcolom> ah ;-)
[07:15:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaah! Thanks!
[07:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> But "pages" is what we agreed on.
[07:15:23] <agcolom> so I can have a changelog folder under pages just liek you have...
[07:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:15:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/autoinit/js/widgets/controlgroup.js
[07:15:35] <agcolom> s/liek/like!
[07:15:44] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Thanks
[07:16:17] <rxaviers> checking..
[07:17:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D000d! That's bad! The initSelectors are hardcoded!
[07:17:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i have to fix that
[07:17:22] <arschmitz> this is not finished yet
[07:17:45] <arschmitz> it will be $.mobile.checkboxradio.prototype.initSelector
[07:17:48] <rxaviers> melter, how did you get that url?
[07:18:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so on the proto? OK.
[07:18:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or similar
[07:18:25] <arschmitz> other then buttonmarkup
[07:18:44] <arschmitz> that has to be hardcoded unless we change buttonmarkup to use an exposed varible for it
[07:18:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we were gonna move from $.mobile.x.prototype.options.initSelector to $.mobile.x.initSelector.
[07:18:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That is, straight on the NS.
[07:19:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and you've exposed enhanceWithButtonMarkup ... 
[07:19:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: initselector will be on prototype
[07:19:49] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you know how did melter get that url?
[07:20:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wanted to keep the reading of data-* attributes out of $.fn.buttonMarkup(), which is why I created enhanceWithButtonMarkup ...
[07:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: From a theme generated last month.
[07:20:20] <melter> rxaviers: it was embedded in the css file
[07:20:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, if the enhancing is going to happen directly, I guess we need to expose the enhancer and its initSelector.
[07:20:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we can have $.fn.buttonMarkup() and $.mobile.buttonMarkup() ... or would that be too confusing?
[07:20:53] <rxaviers> melter, what version was the UI?
[07:20:56] <melter> in jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.css: "* To view and modify this theme, visit http://jqueryui.com/themeroller..."
[07:21:07] <rxaviers> ok thanks
[07:21:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in this case it needs to read the attributes to work properly
[07:21:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i like enhanceWithButtonmarkup
[07:21:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, I know. It's an enhancer.
[07:21:39] <arschmitz> its very clear what it does as a function
[07:21:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but the name is long.
[07:21:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: applyButtonMarkup?
[07:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Seems like it's a mixture of zThemeParams and regular params, right?
[07:22:17] <rxaviers> that's the first bug I noticed this url has :(
[07:22:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* but then we have two functions that do the same thing :(
[07:22:36] <rxaviers> it should have or regular params, or zThemeParams
[07:22:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We have $.fn.buttonMarkup() and we have $.mobile.applyButtonMarkup() :(
[07:23:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they do different things though one reads attributes one does not
[07:23:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and these can be undocumented
[07:23:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but their final product is the same - an element marked up to look like a button.
[07:24:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:24:19] <arschmitz> he have never documented buttonmarkup before have we?
[07:24:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I believe so.
[07:24:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lessee ...
[07:25:21] <uGoMobi> buttonMarkup hasn't been documented
[07:25:30] <_|Nix|_> OK. That's great then!
[07:25:49] <uGoMobi> we only accidently mentioned it in button widget documentation
[07:25:57] <uGoMobi> in the code examples
[07:26:02] <arschmitz> yeah saying that links dont go through it
[07:26:33] <_|Nix|_> Right. I wonder how many have picked up on that.
[07:26:53] <_|Nix|_> ... because right now, $.fn.buttonMarkup() has been modified to not read data-* attributes.
[07:27:09] <arschmitz> oh and _|Nix|_ sorry i had it backwards before im putting the initSelector directly on the constructor not the prototype its only on prototype of you specify it your self 
[07:27:24] <arschmitz> and its then pulled onto the constructor directly 
[07:27:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Good. That's what I figured.
[07:27:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about backcompat? prototype.options.initSelector?
[07:27:53] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/autoinit/js/widgets/controlgroup.js
[07:28:49] <arschmitz> will have to add that
[07:29:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did the registry maintain backcompat for that i dont think it did
[07:29:13] <arschmitz> ?
[07:29:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think for backcompat it should check prototype.options first, because people may have code in place that modifies prototype.options during mobilieinit, by which time you will have copied it over to the constructor.
[07:29:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, it did.
[07:29:32] <arschmitz> ok either way simple to add
[07:29:39] <arschmitz> and yes it should check options first
[07:29:58] <arschmitz> funny that there are no tests for it
[07:30:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It checked constructor.prototype.options.initSelector first, and, if absent, constructor.initSelector.
[07:30:14] <arschmitz> ah ok
[07:30:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But that's only for backcompat - gooone in 1.5.0.
[07:30:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have added at least a dozen deprecate comments in this autoinit branch lol
[07:31:08] <arschmitz> so many things in weird places they dont belong
[07:31:28] <arschmitz> or just doing generally useless things
[07:31:51] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ..
[07:32:05] <arschmitz> like the keepnativeselector being a method on page that joins a user supplied value and the default one
[07:32:23] <arschmitz> and keepnative being on page at all not just a default value on $.mobile
[07:33:19] <arschmitz> and setting pagecontainer background being a page method also 
[07:33:30] <arschmitz> moved that to content widget
[07:33:35] <arschmitz> since thats what it changes
[07:34:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: which brings something up
[07:34:20] <arschmitz> i dont think we should use the name content for content widget
[07:34:26] <arschmitz> maybe switch to container
[07:34:42] <arschmitz> it conflicts with data-role="content" and i think will be confusing
[07:35:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good point!
[07:35:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm still kinda fond of navtainer, but that's too buzz-wordy :)
[07:35:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about just nav?
[07:35:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so basicly didnt change anything major just trying to put things where they make sense
[07:35:42] <arschmitz> navBox
[07:35:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not bad.
[07:35:53] <arschmitz> lol
[07:36:00] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that was a joke?
[07:36:25] <arschmitz> why not keep with what its always been called
[07:36:30] <arschmitz> pageContainer
[07:36:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:36:49] <arschmitz> thats what it has always been before
[07:36:57] <arschmitz> it was just not a widget before
[07:36:59] <_|Nix|_> That's true.
[07:37:28] <arschmitz> and it makes sense and describes exactly what it is
[07:37:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, $.mobile.pageContainer was a singleton jQuery object before whereas now it's a namespace for the widget.
[07:37:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still, I'm good with overwriting it like that.
[07:37:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but $.mobile.pagecontainer will no longer mean anything
[07:38:05] <arschmitz> there is not a single page container anymore so it loses all meaning
[07:38:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, be careful with your capitalization :)
[07:38:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: pageContainer can coexist with $.mobile.pagecontainer :)
[07:38:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah was just typeing fast
[07:38:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, widget names are usually all-lowercase, so it actually won't overwrite $.mobile.pageContainer.
[07:39:04] <arschmitz> true
[07:39:17] <arschmitz> but $.mobile.pagecontainer needs to be depracated anyway
[07:39:33] <arschmitz> pageContainer that is
[07:39:38] * _|Nix|_ go check API docs for pageContainer
[07:40:16] <_|Nix|_> *gulp* two entries.
[07:40:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its documented in changePage()\
[07:40:29] <arschmitz> and loadPage
[07:40:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... yeah, as the default value for the destination.
[07:40:55] <arschmitz> yup
[07:41:02] <arschmitz> which will also no longer make any sense
[07:41:27] <arschmitz> because if you call $("foo").pagecontainer("change","url");
[07:41:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it does make sense. If you don't specify anything, the contents of the body will be replaced, rather than some obscure rectangle somewhere on the current page.
[07:41:39] <arschmitz> the pagecontainer will always and can only be foo
[07:41:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait - I get it.
[07:42:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The container is the selector upon which you call "change".
[07:42:11] <arschmitz> yup
[07:42:34] <arschmitz> so pageContainer as a whole has no meaning with new content widget
[07:43:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, are we removing $.mobile.changePage in 1.4.0? I think that'd be drastic.
[07:43:25] <arschmitz> i thought it was marked for deprecation by john
[07:43:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, for deprecation, but that means that 1.4.0 would still have an implementation of $.mobile.changePage that uses the new pagecontainer widget.
[07:44:03] <arschmitz> right
[07:44:21] <arschmitz> sorry yeah we cant remove it with out deprecation first
[07:44:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I'm thinking $.mobile.changePage = function( url, options ) { $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer( "change", url, options ); };
[07:44:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Where $.mobile.pageContainer = $( "body" ).pagecontainer();
[07:45:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Instantiate that in jquery.mobile.init.js
[07:45:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its all handled by john for backcompat
[07:45:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:45:31] <arschmitz> we just need to put the notice in the blogpost
[07:45:37] <arschmitz> and then yank after 1.4
[07:45:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[07:46:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's implemented exactly like that :)
[07:46:26] <arschmitz> yup
[07:46:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I swear, I didn't read the branch first :)
[07:46:36] <rxaviers> melter, scott_gonzalez, FYI - although params are mixed with zThemeParams (this shouldnt have happened), they represent the same data. So, good.
[07:46:39] <arschmitz> lol
[07:47:23] <arschmitz> really need to move the widget into its own file
[07:47:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so what we have is that $.mobile.pageContainer is $( "body" ) with a content widget, and the old $.mobile.changePage() basically changes the content of body.
[07:47:29] <rxaviers> Anyway, when I click the link (as you mentioned), themeroller opens, theme loads, and the fields seems to be reflecting the theme. Am I missing something?
[07:47:39] <arschmitz> and out of navagation
[07:47:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, definitely!
[07:48:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Shall I?
[07:48:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can rename it in the process.
[07:48:16] <arschmitz> once ill get all tests passing in autoinit i can do it in there
[07:48:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait ... hold the presses!
[07:48:43] <arschmitz> ??
[07:48:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: pagecontainer may give the wrong impression, that only pages can reside within such a pagecontainer.
[07:48:57] <rxaviers> melter, scott_gonzalez^
[07:49:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: how so?
[07:49:11] <arschmitz> its no different then what we have now
[07:49:13] <rxaviers> melter, scott_gonzalez ^
[07:49:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's a ... you know ... "page" container.
[07:49:30] <arschmitz> and it basicly is for pages
[07:49:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But our plan is to later on be able to designate any portion of the document as navigable via such a widget.
[07:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: The fields are incorrect.
[07:50:01] <arschmitz> right then you have multiple page containers
[07:50:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if you have a small rectangle somewhere with two paragraphs, will that have to be marked up as a page to work with this widget?
[07:50:50] <arschmitz> yeah just like it is now ajax nav only works with pages
[07:50:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: For example, clickable active state background = #ffffff instead of #293d98
[07:51:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... 
[07:51:20] <arschmitz> at somepoint this may change but for now 
[07:51:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... OK ...
[07:51:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hm right.. the color preview is right, not the field
[07:51:34] <rxaviers> thanks
[07:51:35] <melter> rxaviers: everything appears fine, but when you look at the values, they don't match what you see (colors, fonts, etc.) and when you change something and tab off, it resets
[07:51:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... though I think johnbender did have this in mind when naming the widget.
[07:51:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's like content - basically any bit of markup.
[07:52:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we could do contentContainer i guess
[07:52:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... not so bad.
[07:52:22] <arschmitz> or contentcontainer rather
[07:53:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... here I go splitting hairs again: $x.contentcontainer( "change", url, options );
[07:53:27] <rxaviers> the issue is the mixed params and zThemeParams
[07:53:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sounds like you're changing the container.
[07:53:50] <rxaviers> opening TR with either one or other, it loads fine
[07:54:15] <rxaviers> Im wondering how it did happen to get mixed
[07:54:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: .contentcontainer( "display" ... ?
[07:54:20] <rxaviers> :-/
[07:54:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *shrug*
[07:54:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think nav needs a bit of an api refresh in general at some point
[07:54:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm fine with "change", just sayin' ...
[07:55:11] <arschmitz> i think keep change for now
[07:55:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... maybe a concerted effort after 1.4.0 ... just as we've had with the widgets.
[07:55:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: yeah. OK.
[08:02:12] <rxaviers> melter, scott_gonzalez, https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/155

[08:41:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: when your around i have a quick question
[08:54:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: what's up?
[08:55:05] <arschmitz> just wondering if you have any idea why the zip would have been skipped in the release upload
[08:55:52] <arschmitz> gseguin: its weird i see it listed in the gruntfile to do it
[08:56:14] <arschmitz> but the output from the release task seems to have just totally skipped that line
[08:56:17] <gseguin> yeah I have no idea
[08:56:24] <gseguin> that was the first thing I checked
[08:56:30] <gseguin> the Gruntfile.js
[08:56:43] <arschmitz> yeah when it outputs the rsync part 
[08:56:47] <gseguin> and confirmed that it was there
[08:56:51] <arschmitz> it went through each set of files
[08:56:59] <arschmitz> execpt zip
[08:57:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: arschmitz : FYI scott_gonzalez just mentioned on the -content channel that our ZIP is at the wrong location
[08:57:13] <uGoMobi> something to look into with gnarf 
[08:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we shouldn't be putting zips on our code CDN.
[08:58:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: makes sense
[08:58:49] <gseguin> where does it belong?
[08:59:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: its literally like it just skipped that line completely no output from it at all 
[08:59:32] <gseguin> if it happens again at the next release I'll spend more time investigating
[08:59:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: sounds good
[09:00:09] <arschmitz> because i have no explanation at all 
[09:00:45] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: where does the zip need to be copied?
[09:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> jquerymobile.com
[09:02:33] <gseguin> k
[10:11:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: re: that iOS4 autoCorrect fix textinput... did you ever got a chance to test if the bug is still there on iOS4?
[10:11:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh forgot all about it 
[10:11:48] <arschmitz> ill try it right now
[10:11:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: np
[10:12:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was thinking about removing the dependency
[10:12:27] <uGoMobi> we have UA sniffing code in the options for preventFocusZoom
[10:12:27] <arschmitz> yeah honestly ill be shocked if they did a patch on ios4 after 5 was released
[10:12:35] <arschmitz> but either way i think we should remove it
[10:12:41] <uGoMobi> yeah not very likely
[10:13:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can throw it somewhere as an extension if someone complains
[10:13:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can we make that UA sniffing code a var and then use it inside _autocorrect as well with additional check for iOS version
[10:13:24] <uGoMobi> ?
[10:13:46] <uGoMobi> or just copy it
[10:13:59] <uGoMobi> not that I like UA sniffing
[10:15:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was thinking if we are doing UA sniffing anyway we might be able to reuse it
[10:16:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah it would be similar to whats in fixedtoolbar workarounds
[10:16:32] <arschmitz> have to check if its ios then check webkit version
[10:16:52] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:18:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not high priority though, but nice to remove the dependency
[10:18:10] <arschmitz> yeah i agree
[10:18:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not in favor of just removing it as long as we support iOS4
[10:18:37] <arschmitz> right now im trying to get collapsible set working
[10:18:45] <arschmitz> with new autoinit something is messed up lol
[10:18:58] <uGoMobi> hmm.... good luck with that
[10:19:43] <arschmitz> lol

[10:19:55] <arschmitz> im thinking it might help to merge collapsible review first
[10:20:02] <arschmitz> since its kinda crazy as is
[10:20:25] <uGoMobi> yeah good idea
[10:21:25] <arschmitz> im going to review it real quick make sure nothing is up and then merge i think _|Nix|_ said it was ready
[10:23:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, he just wanted you to do final check
[10:23:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah im doing it right now
[10:26:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around?
[10:27:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: darn cant do it yet there is an added method to $.widget in there we decided not to add yesterday
[10:28:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what method?
[10:28:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/collapsible-widget-review/js/jquery.mobile.widget.js#L31
[10:30:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it either needs to be moved into collapsible or refactored not to use it 
[10:31:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not a super big deal either way just not quite ready as is
[10:31:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see
[10:32:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: removed means using toggleClass for each class?
[10:33:09] <uGoMobi> or wait
[10:33:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is lots of different ways to handle but basicly right now collapsible calls _setOptions( this.options ) on create
[10:33:19] <arschmitz> which is kinda something to be avoided 
[10:33:34] <arschmitz> and this makes it so you can do that and only cause one reflow
[10:33:42] <uGoMobi> aha
[10:34:02] <arschmitz> really any options on create should be handled as part of enhancment and not through setOptions
[10:34:18] <arschmitz> and then just toggleClass each class in setOptions
[10:34:41] <arschmitz> because perf is not really a concern when setting options after the widget is initalized
[10:35:08] <uGoMobi> I guess people won't change all options at once
[10:35:09] <arschmitz> its not really very common and if they are doing it its generally only one or 2 options not a whole bunch 
[10:35:13] <arschmitz> exactly
[10:36:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i discussed this yesterday he just has not updated the branch yet
[10:37:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:37:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are there other branches we can merge now?
[10:37:42] <arschmitz> button should be all set
[10:37:51] <uGoMobi> cool!
[10:38:04] <arschmitz> controlgroup needs one very minor change but we could merge and then do that
[10:38:11] <arschmitz> its just an option that should not be there
[10:38:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you know if _|Nix|_ will be on tonight (European time)?
[10:39:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no idea
[10:39:25] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:39:42] <arschmitz> im hoping he will want to talk to him about collapsible and get that merged
[10:39:50] <uGoMobi> I wanted to do a merge marathon together
[10:39:54] <arschmitz> i need it to finish autoinit
[10:39:58] <uGoMobi> yeah

[10:41:29] <uGoMobi> thanks travis
[10:42:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/textinputs/ we add an empty class attribute to the native text input element
[10:43:10] <arschmitz> weird ill look
[10:43:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: or is this a Chrome thing?
[10:43:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looking
[10:44:20] <uGoMobi> see it on FF too
[10:48:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm around now.
[10:48:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you think you could update collapsible-review to not use _toggleClass like we talked about?
[10:49:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure.
[10:49:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: other then that i say good to merge
[10:49:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Basically, I'd be moving the code from _setOptions to _enhance.
[10:49:38] <arschmitz> and controlgroup i say remove that leftover init selector and good to merge
[10:50:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That leftover is gone.
[10:50:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: will be a huge help so i can pull those into autoinit
[10:50:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome must need to refresh
[10:50:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll do that now.
[10:51:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome thanks i didnt feel like fighting with collapsible set since you have made it much more sane :)
[10:51:27] <arschmitz> why fight theinsanity
[10:51:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Controlgroup also uses _toggleClasses. I'll have to remove that too.
[10:51:59] <arschmitz> yeah 
[10:52:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thank you this will be a big help 
[10:53:41] <five> I added a demo page to my rotatable plugin. http://godswearhats.com/jquery-ui-rotatable/demo.html
[10:54:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ :what option are we going to remove from controlgroup?
[10:54:09] <five> It's not quite as pretty as I would like it to be :-)
[10:54:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: initSelector
[10:54:36] <arschmitz> it was leftover from 1.3
[10:54:41] <uGoMobi> ah ok thanks
[10:55:10] <arschmitz> yeah not really a true option
[10:55:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We're going to change the way we handle option setting.
[10:55:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, yeah ... initSelector ... not a real option.
[10:55:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, sorry, this wasn't about _toggleClasses
[10:56:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: ok im going to go grab some lunch ill be back in ~1 hour
[10:56:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[10:56:09] <arschmitz> get some things merged
[10:56:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: enjoy your lunch
[10:56:47] <arschmitz> im running full suite on button-review right now since its been a few days then thats good too i think
[10:57:38] <arschmitz> oh actually just noticed one tiny thing i want to change on that before mergeing

[13:24:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man ... It was easy enough removing the call to _setOptions from controlgroup, but it is "bat-shit insane" (© Daniel Stone 2007) modifying collapsible, because that thing has like four sets of options: the existing value, the new value, the inherited value, and the default value. I fit the whole thing in my head once, but it's hard to do it again ...
[13:24:54] <arschmitz> yeah collapsibles are kinda crazy we should really look at ui's
[13:24:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... oh, and some values are non-orthogonal: For example, corners must be false if inset is false.
[13:25:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, we must ignore corners if inset is false, even though the value may be set to true.
[13:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Any option that relies on another option is terrible design.
[13:26:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I know, but you can't always have all your options be orthogonal.
[13:26:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... although this should probably be solved in CSS.
[13:26:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That is, ui-corner-all does not apply radii if ui-collapsible-inset is also set.
[13:27:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That would push the non-orthogonality into CSS, but it would be kinda confusing, because the thing has the corners class but no corners.
[13:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's bad.
[13:28:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Not to mention that in accordions we have inheritable options. That is, the accordion provides all the same options as the individual collapsibles, and so if the collapsible's own value is null, the accordion-wide value takes effect.
[13:28:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I guess we're doing CSS in JS. /That's/ even worse.
[13:29:37] <_|Nix|_> OK. I can have another go at this ... now that I've vented :)
[13:31:38] <uGoMobi> I really like to remove styling options from widgets... corners, inset, mini, shadow
[13:33:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess in the case of accordions, theme inheritance is solved. However, any style that relies on the presence/absence of a class cannot be inherited because then you can't specify something at the parent widget and override it in the child.
[13:34:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, mini for example: If you want the accordion to be mini, but one of the collapsibles not to be mini, well, you can't have that.
[13:34:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, we talked about this before
[13:35:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and now it's coming up again.
[13:35:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you would need a ui-fullsize class to override
[13:35:48] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, and in general, you'd need two classes for each such option - one to turn it on, and one to turn it off.
[13:36:13] <_|Nix|_> I mean, to be able to do inheritance via CSS.
[13:37:47] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:40:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about theme? when you set theme for accordion, do we add ui-group-theme-* class?
[13:40:32] <uGoMobi> or add theme class to individual collapsibles?
[13:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ui-group-theme-*
[13:40:54] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:41:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, I can totally live with this
[13:41:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: I've identified another potential candidate for the base class:
[13:41:18] <_|Nix|_> 	_themeClassFromOption: function( prefix, value ) {
[13:41:21] <_|Nix|_> 		return ( value ? ( value === "none" ? "" : prefix + value ) : "" );
[13:41:23] <_|Nix|_> 	},
[13:41:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We do this in a lot of places, and we tend to do it differently.
[13:42:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess I shoud call the function swatchToTheme.
[13:42:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or swatchToThemeClass()
[13:43:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: or swatchToClass()
[13:45:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should not add anything 100% required to $.widget like that
[13:45:44] <arschmitz> then this becomes mobile onlu
[13:45:56] <arschmitz> instead of just needing ui widget factory
[13:46:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, this idea of swatches /is/ mobile-only.
[13:46:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats just themeing though eventually we will share a common theme system
[13:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Keep in mind that anything mobile only will not exist when widgets are moved to UI.
[13:47:46] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I sympathize with the activate event on the first tab comments.
[13:48:10] <tj_vantoll> I've been bit by that.
[13:48:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, so we gotta figure out how to deal with these swatches. I mean, again, we're gonna have 15 different ways of calculating a class name from a theme and some will honour the value "none", others will apply ui-body-none by mistake, etc.
[13:48:38] <_|Nix|_> I think it really sucks that there's no place for common utility functions anymore.
[13:48:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we just need to decide a standard for it and follow everywhere
[13:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: The problem is that it's wrong. Doing things on first tab isn't always required (perhaps even incorrect).
[13:49:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, a standard where we can't use common code across widgets.
[13:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> If you need it (many do), it's easy to opt into with the create event.
[13:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't and we fire activate, it's impossible to opt out of.
[13:50:03] <tj_vantoll> We need that explained here http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate.
[13:50:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, I can make an extension and use it in every widget that needs it ...
[13:50:43] <tj_vantoll> I'm not necessarily saying the behavior is not sensical, just that it will surprise users.
[13:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Seems fine. We'll need to do it for accordion as well.
[13:51:40] <tj_vantoll> Alright I'll create a docs issue. If we reference that before closing that the ticket maybe that'll appease people a little.
[13:53:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we should look into removing option theme as well, just as the styling options
[13:54:19] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/156
[13:54:20] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: Issue #156 by tjvantoll (7s ago): Document that the activate event is not fired on creation
[13:54:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I'm all in favour of that, and we should totally declare all styling options as deprecated for 1.4.0, to be replaced with the addition/removal of classes by the dev, but we need to implement something for 1.4.0.
[13:57:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I want to deprecate in 1.5 because first we have to make sure everything works when devs at classes themselves
[13:57:15] <uGoMobi> then we can remove it in 1.6
[13:58:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for 1.4 I think we should look into actual issues only.. places where the theme option doesn't work correctly
[13:58:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: inset is being passed down to individual collapsibles.
[13:59:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the accordion does not do anything in response to the inset option. It just passes it on to the collapsibles.
[14:00:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we only have the ui-collapsible-inset class now, right
[14:01:11] <uGoMobi> no ui-collapsible-set-inset
[14:01:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's right.
[14:02:47] <toddmparker> Hey guys
[14:03:03] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you're all official now. w00t
[14:03:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we need a ui-inset / ui-noninset class but that's for 1.5 or 1.6
[14:03:11] <toddmparker> how goes 1.4
[14:03:11] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[14:03:15] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:03:23] <toddmparker> I replied on twitter that we needed a few more days
[14:03:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I used the words "bat-shit insane" today.
[14:03:38] <toddmparker> I can tweet an update if there is one
[14:03:41] <uGoMobi> yeah _|Nix|_ is going crazy
[14:03:42] <toddmparker> ruh-roh
[14:03:48] <toddmparker> what happened _|Nix|_ 
[14:04:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: you can tweet "23:03 <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I used the words "bat-shit insane" today." ;)
[14:04:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: collapsible and collapsibleSet.
[14:04:07] <uGoMobi> nice status update :)
[14:04:32] <toddmparker> I think that would do nicely.
[14:04:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ almost collapsed
[14:04:55] <toddmparker> Team update: "ARGH, everything is on fire. Abandon all hope."
[14:05:14] <toddmparker> what brought on the bat-shit
[14:05:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I updated the SVG support test so Opera (except Next) doesn't get SVG's
[14:06:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ah, cool
[14:06:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I saw a tweet about SVGO
[14:06:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Keeping track of collapsible options across inheritance from the collapsible set.
[14:06:11] <toddmparker> scott is pushing that very change now to NPM
[14:06:33] <toddmparker> yeah, jlembeck just added a flag to turn off SVGO if it's causing problems
[14:06:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: And top that off with the relationship between "corners" and "inset".
[14:06:42] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:06:58] <toddmparker> That test page uses all kinds of different SVG files from different sources. Bound to find one that SVGO nicks.
[14:07:13] <toddmparker> SVGO guy is looking at it
[14:07:22] <toddmparker> cuts file size waaay down tho
[14:07:26] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[14:07:34] <toddmparker> we're going to add PNG optimization in next
[14:07:52] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Ah, all is explained
[14:08:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we really need to get rid of theme, inset, corners, shadow, mini options
[14:08:55] <uGoMobi> but let's get 1.4 out first :)
[14:14:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can you ping me ( when / if :) ) you finish with collapsibleset?
[14:19:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure. I'm actually making some headway.

[18:45:53] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: I was wondering if there was a semi-reliable way to detect mobile browsers and redirect them?
[18:46:23] <arschmitz> not that i really know of
[18:46:38] <ryanneufeld> other than UA sniffing
[18:46:45] <ryanneufeld> which is a terrible idea..
[18:46:50] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: there is stuff like wurfl
[18:46:51] <ryanneufeld> but seems to be the only way
[18:47:26] <arschmitz> which is just fancy database ua sniffing basicly
[18:47:55] <ryanneufeld> I'll check that out
[18:47:56] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[18:48:10] <arschmitz> i used it through a service before
[18:48:22] <arschmitz> and worked great but the service sucked and would go down and cause issues
[18:48:41] <arschmitz> seemed like once a every few months it would go down for like a whole day
[18:48:57] <arschmitz> and that just was not good enough for what i needed
[18:49:42] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: if you only care about phones not tablets i guess you could do it based on screen size
[18:50:00] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:50:09] <ryanneufeld> though many phones have pretty big screens
[18:50:15] <arschmitz> yup
[18:50:17] <arschmitz> note 2
[18:51:00] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: this problem was my big reason to do responsive and abandon anything mobile specific
[18:51:08] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:51:31] <ryanneufeld> unfortunately, when you're ad supported
[18:51:46] <ryanneufeld> and ads aren't responsive
[18:51:49] <arschmitz> yeah makes that pretty hard
[18:51:55] <ryanneufeld> next to impossible
[18:51:59] <arschmitz> yup
[18:52:13] <arschmitz> sucks 
[18:52:45] <arschmitz> it can be done thoguh
[18:52:54] <arschmitz> just have to work around the ads
[18:53:04] <arschmitz> Boston globe does a pretty good job with it
[18:54:03] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: but anyway if you 100
[18:54:15] <arschmitz> % need to do it id say wurfl is sadly best option
[18:54:21] <ryanneufeld> ok
[18:54:22] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[18:55:09] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: oh by the way adding option to not hide url right now
