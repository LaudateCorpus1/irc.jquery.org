[07:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[07:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: ping
[07:15:33] <mikesherov> sup scott_gonzalez 
[07:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> There's something strange going on with .simulate( "blur" ) vs. [0].blur
[07:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason I'm getting 2 blur events.
[07:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'll have code to show you after I commit all of this focus/blur handling stuff.
[07:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> But the main thing I wanted to ask you about can be discussed without seeing this odd behavior.
[07:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf and I spent a lot of time trying to make .simulate( "focus" ) and .simualte( "blur" ) work even for inactive windows.
[07:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm now thinking we shouldn't be doing that.
[07:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> We want .simulate() to be as close to real behavior as possible.
[07:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> Do you agree?
[07:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> So, for example, simulateBlur() which is currently 30 lines, could just be `this.target.blur();`
[07:26:55] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.8.x core build #25: STILL FAILING in 40 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.8.x%20core/25/
[07:29:21] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: unless the element is already blurred or the window is inactive or the element is invisible, in which case it won't fire anything, which is correct for the DOM events but not what jQuery event handlers expect. That may be a bug in our expectations though.
[07:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: But in our tests, we'd want those to fail.
[07:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> The user couldn't have caused that to happen.
[07:30:10] <DaveMethvin> oh right, *simulate*
[07:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> In other words, our tests should never hit those cases.
[07:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> We were hitting them because of TestSwarm being open to the public and people putting their browser in the background.
[07:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> But we've locked down TestSwarm since then.
[07:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's more important for us to control our testing environment than to have tools like .simulate() handle the invalid environments.
[07:31:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah, I really dislike having tests that are fragile like that but focus/blur are so damn flakey it's hard to do them right
[07:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> Well, gnarf and I got them working well everywhere.
[07:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> But handling old and new behavior simultaneously in invalid environments would be really ard.
[07:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> s/ard/hard/
[07:32:37] <DaveMethvin> amen
[07:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather just fall back to [0].blur()
[07:32:52] <DaveMethvin> that seems reasonable

[10:01:47] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> There may be a bug here, hidden in his description.
[10:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> So, the problem is here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L469
[10:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> The question is do we want to support [ 5, 50, 500 ] as a data source (instead of [ "5", "50", "500" ])
[10:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a matter of adding `|| typeof item === "number"`
[10:31:53] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: adding the typeof check seems reasonable
[10:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll add that as soon as I finish fixing these tests.
[11:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Apparently agcolom was able to reproduce the .dots perf issue
[11:49:57] <agcolom> yes, I thought I had a virus... 
[11:50:31] <agcolom> my computer used to freeze for ever! I often had to force quit FF...

[12:35:10] <Krinkle> It's not fair

[12:38:23] <Krinkle> ok

[12:39:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: gnarf: I've fixed http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1774 (it was corrupted, as you 2 have reported)
[12:39:11] <agcolom> (i was always getting FF updates... now I'm on 17.0.1)
[12:40:05] <kborchers> agcolom: hmmm, you're still on snow leopard?
[12:40:16] <kborchers> maybe that's why i can't reproduce
[12:40:16] <agcolom> yes :-(
[12:40:25] <kborchers> interesting
[12:40:34] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: gnarf: I have no idea how this happened, it is very strange. The problem was that a run-result was updated to status=4 (4=CLIENT_LOST), but not unlinked from the job. The only place where status=4 is set is CleanupAction, which always does that together with unlinking it (setting it to NULL in the job queue, so that it is re-ran)
[12:40:49] <Krinkle> somehow there was this 1 result that had both status=4 and was not NULLed
[12:40:51] <agcolom> was scott_gonzalez also getting it on snow leopard?
[12:41:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you never saw it either did you?
[12:41:11] <kborchers> and you're on ML now right?
[12:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on 10.7.5.
[12:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> I never saw it.
[12:41:32] <kborchers> oh Lion
[12:41:33] <Krinkle> gnarf: which is extremely odd, since CleanupAction does the NULL *before* it sets status=4, so even if the php script was killed between those 2 queries, it couldn't have end up in this state.
[12:41:34] <kborchers> ok
[12:41:36] <agcolom> so how did you know?
[12:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> Someone bitched about it over and over.
[12:41:47] <kborchers> agcolom: others complained
[12:42:12] <agcolom> oh! well I guess they were on the same os as me then ;-)
[12:42:31] <agcolom> that's really interesting! 
[12:42:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that issue is closed right? i would be interested to hear if they are also on 10.6
[12:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's closed. We can ask, he might reply.
[12:43:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i'm looking it up now

[14:02:41] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov: looks like I'll be working on draggable for a couple hours now and then tomorrow during my half day - huzzah
[14:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> One thing I just noticed is the iframe covers should probably be appended to the iframe's parent instead of the body.
[14:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> Would handle some dynamic content better.
[14:11:50] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: if you want i can just remove the var body outside of map and do iframe.parent() rather than body in the map
[14:11:53] <Dave_Stein> im looking at it right now
[14:12:04] <Dave_Stein> also where is a good example of backCompat usage?

[14:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think using iframe.parent() will be better.
[14:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, it should fix this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7650
[14:13:36] <Dave_Stein> ok ill go do that right now since its so easy

[14:15:14] <Dave_Stein> so if i do $.widget( "ui.draggable" ) after the initial declaration, it just merges the other options into it?
[14:15:31] <Dave_Stein> cause there is a $.widget("ui.tabs") for just about every feature it seems
[14:17:41] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Also should I return from _start if disabled options is true, or preventDefault, or return false... thinking the first option
[14:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, $.widget( "ui.draggable", $.ui.draggable, { ... } )

[14:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't even be able to get into _start() if it's disabled.
[14:22:15] <scott_gonzalez> If you can, that needs to be fixed in jquery.ui.interaction.js
[14:22:40] <Dave_Stein> so disabled will be universal for interaction?
[14:22:53] <Dave_Stein> that sounds about right :)
[14:27:06] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: would you want that check inside of setup to not call start ( which maps to startproxy ) on mousedown or would you want it first thing in startproxy? i would guess inside startproxy or i'd need to put the disabled check in more than one place ( ie the hook for mouse vs touch )
[14:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> Is it not working right now?
[14:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> All events are bound via ._on(), so the disabled check should be automatic.
[14:29:37] <Dave_Stein> well right now i put the disabled option at the top of _start
[14:29:55] <Dave_Stein> but i dont see a disabled option in interactions at all
[14:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> Was _start() being called when it was disabled?
[14:30:12] <Dave_Stein> let me double check now
[14:30:36] <scott_gonzalez> You need to look up the inheritance chain to find the disabled option. Draggable is 3 levels deep. (draggable -> interaction -> widget)
[14:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> The base widget is what adds the disabled option.
[14:30:50] <Dave_Stein> ah whoops sorry about that
[14:30:53] <Dave_Stein> ill undo what i did
[14:30:55] <Dave_Stein> it's working fine
[14:31:48] <Dave_Stein> should i rebase that commit out or just commit it back to before?
[14:32:04] <Dave_Stein> i see you did containment which is a bit buggy ... ill probably tackle that tomorrow

[14:38:05] <Dave_Stein> when we cut addClasses, is behavior to NOT add ui-draggable automatically

[15:20:16] <rxaviers> Ryan*
[15:21:11] <rxaviers> nope, just sent an IRC msg
[15:21:11] <rxaviers> I would like to read nginx logs to debug a failure Im having with download buidler
[15:21:25] <ryanneufeld> on jq02.stage right?
[15:24:34] <rxaviers> right
[15:24:57] <ryanneufeld> try now
[15:25:38] <rxaviers> cool! Im in
[15:25:49] <ryanneufeld> k, be good :)
[15:25:54] <rxaviers> let me try to access the logs
[15:28:20] <rxaviers> -rw-r----- 1 www-data adm
[15:28:32] <rxaviers> Im trying /var/log/nginx/download.jqueryui.com.error.log
[15:28:34] <ryanneufeld> k, lemme add you to that group
[15:28:39] <rxaviers> cool thks
[15:29:10] <ryanneufeld> wait, you can sudo
[15:29:17] <rxaviers> ah!!
[15:29:18] <rxaviers> right
[15:29:22] <ryanneufeld> lols
[15:29:23] <clarkbox> rxaviers - you could use splunk to dig through those logs
[15:29:31] <rxaviers> eheh
[15:29:32] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: is right
[15:29:41] <clarkbox> however, the splunk box appears to be down
[15:29:45] <rxaviers> aha! good to know
[15:29:54] <clarkbox> ryan, anything you can do about that? do you have the keys to the new MT architecture?
[15:29:55] <rxaviers> got the link to the logs there?
[15:30:09] <clarkbox> all you would do is search for...
[15:30:23] <clarkbox> source="*/download.jqueryui.com.error.log"
[15:32:13] <rxaviers> clarkbox, ok thks! will give it a try too
[15:32:18] <rxaviers> ls
[15:32:21] <rxaviers> ops
[15:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Always add the ui-draggable class.
[15:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> Append to body if one is not found.
[15:35:34] <clarkbox> ryanneufeld ^
[15:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> The cancel option is not being removed.
[15:36:10] <ryanneufeld> clarkbox: best to ask in #infra
[15:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, finished reading that sentence.... changing cancel would overwrite the exclude value.
[15:36:21] <clarkbox> ya - just thought i would get you while you're here
[15:36:25] <rxaviers> brb
[15:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> See tabs back compat for examples, such as selected -> active
[15:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> $( "body" ) is always invalid to use in widgets. It has to be this.document[0].body, or equivalent.
[15:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: See autocomplete's _appendTo() for how to handle appendTo option.
[15:42:53] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, whats the proper way to add a class to a jui dialog popup?
[15:43:07] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, whats the proper way to add a class to the buttons on a jui dialog popup?
[15:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> For the generated wrapper, use the dialogClass option.
[15:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> For the buttons, just specify the classes in the attribute hash.
[16:14:29] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: just read all that, the addClass backcompat is funny then since it defaults to true to add ui-draggable to element. So I guess the backCompat of false would just do a removeClass on the one that was just added?
[16:14:35] <_zoggy_> attrib hash?
[16:14:47] <_zoggy_> im adding them during initalization
[16:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: No, the back compat would have to make it not add the class.
[16:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: buttons: [ { text: "whatever", click: function() {}, "class": "..." } ]
[16:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: The purpose of the option is to avoid a perf hit.
[16:17:01] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: wouldn't that mean that _create would need to check for the option or for that one line to become a function that would be overwritten? i'm guessing the second is preferred
[16:17:03] <_zoggy_> hmm yeah thats what im doing 
[16:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> It'd have to be the second.
[16:17:24] <Dave_Stein> yeah no checking backcompat in main area
[16:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> But really we can just not do back compat.
[16:17:33] <Dave_Stein> just checkin about the checking :)
[16:18:13] <Dave_Stein> well i suppose we could backCompat it since it's such a dumb function that you could blink it away in 2.1 with no worry
[16:18:33] <Dave_Stein> and is the extra function call that much of a performance hit in the scheme of "on creation"
[16:18:53] <Dave_Stein> meanwhile I think I'm a bit tired since my brain won't give me the answer to cursorAt haha so I'm about to head out
[16:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's not the function call that's a hit, it's the DOM change and reflow.
[16:19:17] <Dave_Stein> right right
[16:19:22] <Dave_Stein> i just meant it's no big deal to backCompat then
[16:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I implemented cursorAt in a demo already.
[16:19:40] <Dave_Stein> oh email me that dave@behance.com so I can take a look
[16:19:57] <Dave_Stein> you gotta tell me what you did already so i don't double work 
[16:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: It's in the repo.
[16:20:12] <Dave_Stein> damn it! you win this round
[16:20:21] <Dave_Stein> i wasnt looking at the repo thinking no one did anything 
[16:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/demos/draggable/cursor-style.html
[16:20:39] <Dave_Stein> thx
[16:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the January history of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/interactions/demos/draggable
[16:21:27] <Dave_Stein> but anywho, i'll backcompat addClasses even though it means turning one line into a function because it shouldn't hurt for too long
[16:22:15] <Dave_Stein> oops almost forgot to push a change
[16:22:26] <jquicommit> 01[13jquery-ui01] 15DaveStein pushed 1 new commit to 06interactions: 02http://git.io/iCghOg
[16:22:26] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06interactions 144626c2b 15Dave Stein: Draggable: Added cursor backCompat
[16:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the purpose of back compat is provide a release in which the user can adjust their code.
[16:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> There are no adjustments to make here, there will be no equivalent in 2.1
[16:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> So back compat doesn't really give us anything.
[16:23:12] <Dave_Stein> ok i'll update wiki then
[16:24:41] <Dave_Stein> okay time for home. i will take a look at your demos tomorrow and get more in
[16:24:56] <Dave_Stein> thx for help
[16:44:07] <rxaviers> ryanneufeld, do you know how is nginx gateway configured? Is the confs at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ (didnt find)?
[16:44:29] <rxaviers> I am suspecting there is a flood protection on nginx limiting the number of GET params
[16:44:42] <ryanneufeld> rxaviers: sorry I don't, that predates me, I don't know anything about nginx
[16:45:39] <rxaviers> I dont know much neither :)
[16:45:46] <rxaviers> you know who does? gnarf?
