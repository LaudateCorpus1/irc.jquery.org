[05:02:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, cant use autocomplete or spinner?
[05:03:00] <jzaefferer> I clicked the datepicker, nothing happens
[05:03:17] <jzaefferer> the overlay CSS changed in 1.10, so shouldn't be a problem for 1.9
[05:04:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: but yeah, autocomplete and spinner can't be used either
[05:04:20] <jzaefferer> http://bassistance.de/i/5ff790.png
[05:05:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: adding `position:absolute` to the .ui-widget-overlay is enough
[05:06:26] <jzaefferer> One of those I should just fix directly

[05:14:12] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #173: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/173/
[05:19:35] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: here
[05:20:38] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: so the .gitattributes thing
[05:20:38] <mikesherov> you on windows?
[05:20:57] <jzaefferer> OSX 10.6.8
[05:21:09] <mikesherov> that's so weird
[05:21:18] <jzaefferer> git 1.8.0
[05:21:22] <mikesherov> not sure why it would say replacing CRLF in a jpg file
[05:21:43] <mikesherov> it SHOULD do it for files that are text only.
[05:23:16] <mikesherov> so, we can back that change out if you'd like. but I'm not seeing the behavior you describe
[05:25:02] <jzaefferer> installing git 1.8.1, maybe its a bug in 1.8.0?
[05:25:12] <jzaefferer> what git version do you have?
[05:27:23] <mikesherov> lemme check
[05:27:37] <mikesherov> git version 1.7.10.2 (Apple Git-33)
[05:28:24] <jzaefferer> well, try install 1.8.1?
[05:29:13] <jzaefferer> If I change the * to *.js to issue goes away
[05:31:17] <jzaefferer> apparently you could also exclude image files like this: "*.jpg           -text"
[05:32:03] <jzaefferer> or "*       text=auto" to do what we're doing now, but only for text files
[05:32:49] <jzaefferer> that also works for me
[05:33:43] <jzaefferer> btw. it looks like git is picky when it actually checks LFs
[05:34:00] <jzaefferer> I notice this in particular when switching from one branch back to master
[05:34:03] <jzaefferer> e.g. checkout grid, then back to master
[05:34:33] <jzaefferer> with "*       text=auto" I now get LF-changes in external/jquery.mousewheel.js, jquery-1.8.3.js and tests/jquery-1.8.3.js
[05:45:14] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: * text=LF is what we want
[05:45:31] <mikesherov> we want consistent LF endings for all of our text files
[05:47:11] <jzaefferer> "When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line normalization. If git decides that the content is text, its line endings are normalized to LF on checkin."
[05:47:59] <jzaefferer> I don't see text=LF mentioned here at all: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitattributes.html
[05:52:15] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: oh, right
[05:52:52] <mikesherov> sorry, i got confused between that and autocrlf
[05:53:19] <jzaefferer> do you see files change when you do `git checkout grid; git checkout master`?

[07:00:23] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...release script isn't picking up the correct current version: http://cl.ly/image/0o3r1H3H2S3E
[07:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right. We can't do major releases.
[07:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should just parse the output of `git tag`.
[07:01:35] <chadoh> Hello, all. `tooltip` is a great, but I'd like to make the tooltips on my site accessible in touch devices. I suppose this requires it handling 'click' events. Do you feel that this is in the scope of `tooltip`? Part of me wants to spin my own click-or-hover tooltips, and part of me wants to fork the jqueryui repo & start test driving the addition of click support.
[07:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> chadoh: If you want to get it working without degrading any other functionality, go ahead :-)
[07:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's not something we've looked at.

[08:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Are you going to push an update for that?
[08:19:44] <jzaefferer> Apparently git is rather picky when it actually checks those files

[10:26:57] <rworth> right bottom
[11:34:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its totally the right bottom
[12:28:31] <rxaviers> gnarf, ping
[12:45:47] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer i just left this open since it was rather long http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13181
[12:46:53] <gnarf> rxaviers: sup
[12:47:24] <rxaviers> im isolating legacy images php code, Im running thru some trobles and I'd like to isolate php.
[12:47:35] <rxaviers> I remember we are using 5.2.4 in old.jqueryui.com right?
[12:47:54] <rxaviers> where did you get it from? is it from repo? or you compiled it yourself?
[12:48:14] <rxaviers> troubles*
[12:51:16] <rxaviers> By the way, locally I've compiled php 5.2.17 and 5.2.4. But, in both Im getting this error:
[12:51:17] <rxaviers> Fatal error: Using $this when not in object context in /tmp/image.jqueryui.com/phpthumb.class.php on line 3700
[12:51:54] <rxaviers> Im pissed off php does not stack trace the error. Im trying to get some more info. But, that's a long time since I play with php :S
[12:57:01] <rxaviers> backtrace*
[13:01:55] <gnarf> rxaviers: the version of php is just apt-get install 
[13:01:58] <gnarf> on debian
[13:02:17] <gnarf> rxaviers: also, "xdebug" extension has better error handling
[13:02:28] <rxaviers> can you send me the output of apt-cache show php
[13:02:41] <rxaviers> if you could also provide me phpinfo() output
[13:02:55] <rxaviers> heard about "xdebug", will try to install it locally here ;) thks
[13:04:11] <gnarf> rxaviers: actually i have no clue where this php is from
[13:04:14] <gnarf> its an old server
[13:04:16] <gnarf> pre-dates me
[13:04:22] <gnarf> its ubuntu
[13:04:44] <rxaviers> on the new server, are we able to use this same php?
[13:04:50] <rxaviers> I think we'll need to install a custom one at /opt right?
[13:06:28] <gnarf> rxaviers: https://gist.github.com/77ddb3842eb427814870
[13:06:45] <gnarf> rxaviers: new server?
[13:06:58] <rxaviers> new server I mean download.jqueryui.com
[13:07:05] <gnarf> are we leaving the image code in php on that server?
[13:07:14] <rxaviers> (thks for the output)
[13:08:01] <gnarf> is it not possible to port the image manipulation to something in node, or even just shelling to imagemagick?
[13:08:28] <rxaviers> as I understood from scott_gonzalez, we are deprecating this old.jqueryui.com making maintenance easier.
[13:08:33] <gnarf> i would prefer not having to install specific custom versions of php 
[13:09:10] <gnarf> yeah, we should get rid of this server ASAP - but that doesn't mean we should move the service without updating it to be in the 'new style' i.e. - in node in download builder
[13:09:11] <rxaviers> Im isolating the php code that does this and will make a simpler deploy for it
[13:09:20] <rxaviers> (does the image manipulation)
[13:09:37] <rxaviers> porting all code to something else is a much bigger scope
[13:10:04] <gnarf> agree - but is there really that much?
[13:10:37] <gnarf> i mean, is it a day or two in man hours? more?
[13:10:45] <rxaviers> on older themeroller, the code is under themeroller/images/**
[13:10:51] <rxaviers> be my guest to take a look :D
[13:11:03] <rxaviers> I think it's way more
[13:11:25] <gnarf> i assume the index.php is the workhorse?
[13:11:29] <rxaviers> I am not saying we need to stick with this forever
[13:11:35] <rxaviers> Im saying that's one step further
[13:11:59] <rxaviers> on getting rid of legacy stuff
[13:12:10] <rxaviers> we'll get there :D
[13:12:17] <rxaviers> be patient
[13:12:17] <rxaviers> hehe
[13:12:41] <rxaviers> It is not that much trouble having another php version in the same machine neither. Im only talking about the interpreter
[13:13:27] <rxaviers> I hopefully will be able to provide you step-by-step compiling a new php version and configuring nginx in download.jqueryui.com server
[13:13:56] <rxaviers> It's pretty straightforward on that regard
[13:14:22] <gnarf> rxaviers: its a whole world of trouble when you consider we automate it, and installing multiple package versions is a PITA...  -- if it doesn't work on the 5.3.16-1~dotdeb.0 we have...
[13:14:39] <gnarf> rxaviers: you want to write puppet manifests to handle installing it too?
[13:15:03] <gnarf> rxaviers: package maintained or bust IMO - That index.php is doing a lot of strange shit
[13:15:04] <gnarf> :)
[13:15:11] <gnarf> whats the mysql query for in there?
[13:15:22] <rxaviers> you see :'(
[13:15:28] <gnarf> afaik, all this does is open a file, change colors right?
[13:15:47] <rxaviers> that code suck - I dont know who wrote/patched that. But, it's very illegible
[13:15:59] <rxaviers> there are patterns too
[13:16:04] <rxaviers> textures
[13:18:03] <rxaviers> Touching that php code for php 5.3 will be a pain, because on PHP5.3 regexp changed from posix to something else and phpthumb uses a lot of regexps there
[13:18:13] <rxaviers> I smell trouble upgrading
[13:18:35] <rxaviers> And I dont think maintaining that code is the right thing to do. Because, it seems phpthumb is abandoned.
[13:18:48] <rxaviers> It will be more prudent in the future to re-write that.
[13:20:10] <rxaviers> For now, to get rid of old.jqueryui.com ASAP, the quicker approach I see is isolating the images php code and creating a simple(r) deploy for it. I know it's not as simple when we talk about automating it.
[13:20:30] <rxaviers> But, I'll be glad to help there if you will
[13:21:21] <gnarf> rxaviers: i'd probably just leave it on that server
[13:21:54] <rxaviers> cc scott_gonzalez ^
[13:22:56] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, shall us rewrite that images thing instead? ^
[13:25:20] <rxaviers> gnarf, Im using the following configuration
[13:25:33] <rxaviers> nginx config https://gist.github.com/4488100
[13:26:09] <rxaviers> fastcgi:
[13:26:16] <rxaviers> # /usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9001 -C 6 -u nginx -f /opt/php-5.2.17/bin/php-cgi
[13:27:10] <rxaviers> perhaps the only thing left to automation will be compiling php-5.2.17 and previously installing it's pre-reqs
[13:27:22] <gnarf> why tho, whats wrong with leaving it on the old server?
[13:27:45] <gnarf> until we can like, actually replace it
[13:27:54] <gnarf> i mean, i understand killing off the rest of "old...."
[13:28:11] <gnarf> btw
[13:28:19] <gnarf> there are a few wrappers for imagemagick
[13:28:31] <gnarf> but it should be able to do whatever compositions are needed
[13:28:58] <rxaviers> Im ok with whatever decision.
[13:29:14] <rxaviers> I think it will be good to have scott in the talk too
[13:29:31] <rxaviers> Im leaving soon (now actually), but will be back later today and all day tomorrow
[13:29:58] <rxaviers> gnarf, when is it best for you to have a 20-30min talk about it?
[13:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I assumed the code would be able to be moved without any issues.
[13:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> If we can't use the existing code with PHP 5, then it might be worth just biting the bullet and switching to node now.
[13:36:14] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, we are able to use PHP <= 5.2 only without (theoretically) any issues
[13:38:33] <gnarf> rxaviers: i got time now
[13:38:50] <gnarf> but bout done for today, tomorrow works too, but lots of afternoon meetings for jQuery already

[13:40:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i mean, i don't think node per se will have a solution
[13:40:54] <gnarf> but imagemagick should be able to do it command line
[13:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there are modules we can use too.
[13:41:51] <gnarf> convert infile.png -fuzz 0% -fill 'newcolor' -opaque 'origcolor' outfile.png
[13:43:33] <gnarf> seems "gm" is just an abstraction around graphicsmagick which implements those options too: http://aheckmann.github.com/gm/
[13:44:46] <gnarf> gm("img").fill( newcolor ).opaque( oldcolor ).write
[13:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a nice abstraction.
[13:48:32] <gnarf> https://twitter.com/bethrobson/status/288723181722808320
[13:48:44] <gnarf> graphicsmagick seems like the right lib here
[13:49:01] <gnarf> its like the lodash of imagemagick apparentlyu
[13:49:02] <gnarf>  ;)
[13:49:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:00:10] <rxaviers> Im back
[14:05:51] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, any verdict?
[14:06:25] <gnarf> rxaviers: i think we need to shoot for a rewrite in node using gm
[14:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like we should use http://aheckmann.github.com/gm/
[14:07:11] <rxaviers> Ok, so it seems ok to stay with old.jqueryui.com for some longer time then
[14:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..Aaron moved to CA?
[14:07:57] <rxaviers> Since we are rewriting it, is there any new requests/plans on it? I just read today about a plan to update icons set.
[14:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we works for 10gen now.
[14:08:54] <rxaviers> a new comment on an old plan actually
[14:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, *I* have no plans on updating the icons.
[14:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> rworth might have something to say about it though.
[14:10:36] <rxaviers> ok, rworth if you have any plans for the future of texture/icons/background etc of jquery ui themes, please just let me know.
[14:11:22] <rworth> I did some work on the wiki years back, some others have done as well
[14:11:49] <rworth> these many years later, I feel like icon fonts have achieved any and all goals I had
[14:12:59] <rxaviers> (by the way node gm seems a pretty cool wrapper)
[14:24:17] <gnarf> rxaviers: fill / opaque is the color replace btw for imagemagick, i had to go dig that out of some old old code
[14:24:17] <gnarf> :)
[14:24:56] <rxaviers> ;) thks for letting me know
[14:25:36] <gnarf> rxaviers: http://www.graphicsmagick.org/GraphicsMagick.html#details-opaque
[14:25:38] * rxaviers was reading all about TR in the wiki
[14:26:26] <rxaviers> rworth, you think we should go to font icons or not, pardom didnt get?
[14:27:03] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: jquery.ui.effect.js shouldn't depend on jquery.uicore.js right?
[14:27:05] <rworth> I'm not prepared to suggest any change we make at the moment. I think it would depend largely on the future(s) of themerollers
[14:27:23] <gnarf> mikesherov: pretty sure it doesn't
[14:27:29] <mikesherov> It does
[14:27:40] <mikesherov> $.fn.addBack shim is in core
[14:27:47] <mikesherov> effects uses addBack
[14:27:50] <gnarf> oh
[14:28:02] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery-ui/68e5ebcf1aba2ff658b6c9095bc004a84c86b991/tests/unit/effects/effects.html?nojshint=true&jquery=1.7
[14:28:08] <rxaviers> rworth, on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39787461/ThemeRoller%20Rewrite, it talks about "Incorporate box-shadow and text-shadow CSS3 properties to add visual depth to the themes" , "Deprecate the image pattern-based background images in favor of CSS based gradients to reduce the number of images required for a theme", "Consider moving to the vector-based icons under development to gain scalable icons"
[14:28:23] <rxaviers> It seems the approach mobile took. So, it seems toddmparker ideas. Am I right?
[14:28:24] <mikesherov> I can fix it by adding core to the unit test suite :-)
[14:28:36] <mikesherov> or by adding the shim in effects also...
[14:28:45] <gnarf> or undo the "addBack"
[14:28:54] <mikesherov> andSelf is deprecated right?
[14:29:34] <rxaviers> What's in the wiki is a consensus or is it still a debate?
[14:29:43] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/8ec7a1b69ffd86edbef06e30ca4368600531e649
[14:30:12] <gnarf> mikesherov: it is deprecated yes, but it's not going away in 1.9 is it?
[14:30:26] <mikesherov> gnarf: no
[14:30:35] <rxaviers> (ah just saw the wiki history and it's all Todds posts) :)
[14:30:51] * gnarf shrugs, i suppose we could dupe the addBack shim in effect.js
[14:31:19] <mikesherov> or even just not shim, and just assign addBack to andSelf
[14:31:32] <gnarf> mikesherov: andSelf doesn't take a selector tho
[14:31:48] <mikesherov> gnarf: in core: jQuery.fn.andSelf = jQuery.fn.addBack;
[14:31:58] <gnarf> old andSelf
[14:32:02] <mikesherov> hmm
[14:32:04] <mikesherov> OK
[14:32:08] <gnarf> addBack added the selector
[14:32:13] <mikesherov> got it
[14:32:24] <mikesherov> so then reshim in effects
[14:32:32] <mikesherov> I think that's the right call for now
[14:32:37] <mikesherov> thoughts?
[14:33:03] <gnarf> reshim in effect, or just use andSelf() with a comment saying "upgrade to addBack when 1.8 is minimum"
[14:33:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^
[14:33:44] <gnarf> Personal vote is option 2 there, use andSelf - it works just fine :)
[14:34:06] <gnarf> 0 code size impact
[14:35:07] <mikesherov> I could go either way. I prefer shims so we can use latest and greatest
[14:35:32] <gnarf> it doesn't need the "selector" argument
[14:35:44] <gnarf> so like, the shim is more power than we need for that use
[14:36:17] <gnarf> it's also the only use inside effect anything
[14:36:27] <gnarf> so like we'd be shimming a function we don't need when there already is one we can use
[14:36:46] <mikesherov> fair enough
[14:37:03] <mikesherov> just I hate using deprecated functionality
[14:39:18] * gnarf shrugs - unless DaveMethvin goes crazy and removes .andSelf() from the API in the 'near' future - we should have time to get to where UI requires 1.8 and we can switch to the non-deprecated method
[14:39:49] <DaveMethvin> .andSelf is around for a while
[14:40:08] <DaveMethvin> until next week at least :P
[14:40:24] <DaveMethvin> naw ga and use it
[14:42:06] <mikesherov> k
[14:43:19] <gnarf> im gonna run for the day
[14:43:22] <gnarf> catch yall tomorrow
[16:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: We should shim :-)
[16:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> The shim is tiny.
[16:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> And we shouldn't use deprecated functionality.
[16:54:54] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't want effects relying on UI core.

[19:03:51] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez howzit going?
[19:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> Going to do the release when I wake up.
[19:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> I did a dry run with grunt 0.4 and it seemed to work properly.
[19:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think we've got some work to do to get the script working for final releases though.
[19:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> But that's unrelated to the grunt 0.4 upgrade.
[19:22:50] <DaveMethvin> seems like nobody is around, i wanted to tweet the release so I think i will wait until tomorrow morning as well. All the files are already in place
