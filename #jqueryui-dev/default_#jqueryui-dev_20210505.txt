[10:36:55] <eirslett> Hey there! Are any jQuery UI maintainers here?
[10:37:28] <eirslett> I recently made a little PR to make jQuery UI compatible with the next-generation build tools (esbuild, snowpack, vite, etc)... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1956
[10:38:08] <eirslett> Is this kind of change generally in the direction that the jQuery UI project wants to take? I'm wondering if merging it, to make an ESM release, would be the right thing, or whether it's better that I publish an esm fork on my own...
