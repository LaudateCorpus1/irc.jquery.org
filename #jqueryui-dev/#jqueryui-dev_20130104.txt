[03:50:39] <Ashley_> hello, I've noticed that the jQuery UI selectmenu doesn't do anything when the reset event is triggered on the form it is in^

[05:43:03] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, on base.css line 392, we have:
[05:43:35] <rxaviers> button, input, select, textarea {font-size: 100%;} /*among other styles*/
[05:43:50] <rxaviers> * 1. Corrects font size not being inherited in all browsers.
[05:44:10] <rxaviers> But, that makes DB/TR input sizes weird
[05:44:43] <rxaviers> Do you know who add that? I'd like to understand that standarization

[05:48:57] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers font-size is not inherited on those elements therefore it needs an explicit declaration - http://jsfiddle.net/yP45e/
[05:51:39] <rxaviers> I've updated your fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/yP45e/1/, here it's working pretty well to me.
[05:51:58] <rxaviers> I will double check what's wrong in DB/TR styles which is making input fields so small
[05:52:10] <rxaviers> thks
[06:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: It comes from normalize.css https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css
[06:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> The rules at the top are a combination of normalize.css and H5BP.
[06:00:48] <rxaviers> great
[06:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> But I ripped out some rules that don't apply to us and smashed some together.
[06:00:59] <rxaviers> so I will fix TR/DB styles
[06:01:45] <rxaviers> we have font-sizes on DB where we dont need
[06:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray for simplifying the CSS :-)
[06:02:24] <rxaviers> hehe
[06:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> I realize that adjusting for new-css is a pain, but it does seem like this round will result in cleaner CSS than when you had to adjust all the styles for the previous version.

[09:54:24] <rxaviers> That's great scott_gonzalez. Although, I have antecipated myself about unused font-sizes on TR/DB... It seems it'll keep the same amount of font-size's plus explicitly defining font-size in px for #themeroller input/select/etc... Updating it.

[11:45:37] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, DB/TR is up to new-css
[11:46:10] <rxaviers> Seems good to me. Needs more eyeballs to double check
[11:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Awesome, I'll check it out soon.
[11:46:38] <rxaviers> cool :) thks
[11:46:53] <rxaviers> Question: shall I remove pre-built line from DB links?
