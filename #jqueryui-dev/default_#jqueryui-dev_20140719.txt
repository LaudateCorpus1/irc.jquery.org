[09:16:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The good news is that I have realized that using position: absolute more extensively allows me to accept pre-rendered buttons. Since with position: absolute the input takes up no room but resides at the correct offset, I've decided to only remove the position: absolute when I calculate that the input should be on a line by itself. I can still adjust its width even though I could technically keep it at 100%, because, in orde
