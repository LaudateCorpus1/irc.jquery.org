[07:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Is there a demo of this anywhere? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/613/files
[07:03:17] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (2d, 23h ago): Menu: Add categories with unlinked or empty menu items
[07:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> I assume not, in which case I'll just pull it down locally.
[07:04:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nope ... also please read the comments and let me know what you think about my afterthought
[07:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> Is this a concept that exists on desktops?
[07:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> The closest I'm seeing on OS X is Chrome creating disabled menu items to mimic headers.
[07:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> For example, the Recently Closed and Recently Visited headers in the History menu.
[07:27:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not exactly from what i can tell ... OSX does do some grouping with horizontal dividers in many menus ... like the Edit menu in Chrome or most any other application
[07:27:30] <kborchers> don't see much use of headers though
[07:28:48] <kborchers> with the headers i was thinking more along the lines of a select with optgroups, if this was baked into menu, then it would be less hacking of the menu for selectmenu ... just a thought
[07:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like there's not much hacking to do though. Isn't it just a disabled item for the optgroup and a class on the menu items within the optgroups to add padding?
[07:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose it'd be nice to have the styling just work, but I'm not sure that's something that's actually supported by AT.
[07:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> The concept of headers.
[07:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o, michelled: What info do users get when interacting with optgroups in selects?
[07:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> Is it consistent across browser/OS/AT?
[07:33:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i would have to look at selectmenu again to see if it would save that much ... like a said, just a thought
[07:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I haven't looked at menu in a long time, I'm kind of worried about the complexity that already exists.
[07:35:17] <kborchers> i really don't think it's that bad ... i do work with it a lot though so my perception may be skewed
[07:35:31] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: not entirely sure i know what you mean, but if you are asking if the user experience is the same for selects across browsers they aren't exactly. for example safari puts a check mark next to the selected item. Also in some browsers the option will change automatically as you arrow throw it, others you have to explicitly confirm your selection
[07:35:43] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: is that was you were looking for or something else?
[07:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm wondering specifically about optgroups and how they get reported through AT.
[07:36:33] <scott_gonzalez> Visually the biggest clue is just indentation.
[07:39:11] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: ah sorry, now i understand. I haven't had a chance to play with it very much yet, but let me ask someone else over here if they know.
[07:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> VoiceOver doesn't say anything (at least in Chrome).
[07:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> It reports the optgroup label as dimmed, and reports the options as regular options, no indication that they're grouped.
[07:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> I assume there's no accessible information to provide, but I could be wrong.
[07:55:03] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: i didn't find any definitive answers.. the suggestion i got was to check the to see what information the browser is publishing to the accessibility api. If there is good info being published then it will be up to the AT to use it.. so that would be the next place to check
[07:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I should really get an environment setup where I can see that.
[07:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> Could you create a page with details on how to do that and link to it from http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/43766322/Accessibility-Overview ?
[07:56:40] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: so tools recommended are Accprobe in winXP. Accerciser ing GNOME, and DOMInspector which is a firefox plugin
[07:57:11] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: sure i can look into that
[07:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. I should do a fresh install of a VM and walk through setting everything up again so we can have good documentation on setting up all the tools.
