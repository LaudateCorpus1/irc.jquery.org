[05:53:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Adding the classes a priori seems to fix it.
[05:53:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think I'll remove the load order stuff, because it's too invasive for a patch release.
[05:53:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what are you talking about?
[05:53:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7719
[05:54:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[05:54:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm using your performance improvement trick: To add classes a priori that would be added during widget instantiation anyway.
[05:54:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... except in this case, it also happens to fix IE11 :)
[05:55:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh yeah because it does not need to "re-paint"
[05:55:07] <arschmitz> its paints right in the first place
[05:56:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I wouldn't say that. The header is not there, and the theme is not yet applied, so there's nothing to inherit, but I guess it calculates all the right things all the right way and in the right order for that glitch to not show up.

[06:00:10] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll BB in like 6-7 hours.
[06:00:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[06:22:45] <ianmaffett> arschmitz: question for you.  In $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight - what's the reasoning for subtracting the pageOuterHeight-pageHeight ?
[06:44:29] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: let me look real quick
[06:51:51] <ianmaffett> arschmitz: thanks - I'm looking into #7711 - found another issue too.  http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/panel-external-internal/   Clicking that page makes the footer jump up/down
[06:52:46] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: crazy enough thats not actually a bug just a far less then ideal page layout
[06:53:10] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: the headers have a tap toggel feature that switches them from fixed to relative position
[06:53:21] <arschmitz> so you can if your scrolled down essentially hide them
[06:53:34] <arschmitz> because it puts them at the top and bottom of the page in flow
[06:53:39] <ianmaffett> Ahh...ok
[06:53:45] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: however this page is shorter then the screen
[06:54:12] <arschmitz> so for the demo we should either make the page taller or turn off tap toggel on the footer i think
[06:54:18] <arschmitz> because this looks bad
[06:54:34] <ianmaffett> :)
[06:55:24] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: Personally I don't like taptoggel lol any time i ever actually used a fixed toolbar i turned it off. 
[07:07:18] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: its to take into account borders and margins 
[07:07:32] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: the subtraction in reset active page height
[07:07:32] <ianmaffett> ok - thanks
[08:21:53] <ldeluca> arschmitz: sanity check... so I'm testing a local build of jquery and there is a style .ui-input-text, .ui-input-search and I can't find it anywhere
[08:22:41] <arschmitz> ldeluca: local build of jQuery Mobile you mean right?
[08:22:41] <ldeluca> arschmitz: The only location i see it in is mobile.forms.textinput.css
[08:23:14] <ldeluca> arschmitz: but when I rearrange the css and build it's not taking my changes.  So maybe this is more of a build question :)
[08:23:25] <ldeluca> arschmitz: let me try doing a crazy change to see if it gets my changes
[08:23:27] <arschmitz> ldeluca: it should be in /dist/jquery.mobile.css and /dist/jquery.mobile.min.css
[08:23:29] <ldeluca> arschmitz: yes, local
[08:23:45] <ldeluca> arschmitz: yea, it's in there... but not getting my change from the build
[08:24:06] <arschmitz> what are you doing for the build grunt build?
[08:25:01] <ldeluca> arschmitz: looks like it is getitng my changes.  wish I could send you a screen shot, one sec
[08:25:26] <arschmitz> ldeluca: yeah im a little confused
[08:25:40] <arschmitz> where exactly are you checking for your changes?
[08:25:48] <arschmitz> ldeluca: and what are the changes your making?
[08:28:36] <ldeluca> arschmitz: I figured it out. let me check in this change and have you look at the pull request to make sure it's legal

[09:16:02] <arschmitz> diosney: We do not test or officially support angular in jquery mobile
[09:16:02] <arschmitz> diosney: so how well they work together i cant really say
[09:17:12] <diosney> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[09:17:30] <arschmitz> diosney: i would never say its a bad idea to use jquery mobile if you like it though
[09:17:32] <diosney> arschmitz: have you planned supporting it? it could be awesome
[09:17:54] <arschmitz> diosney: no its unlikely we will officially support angular
[09:17:59] <diosney> arschmitz: ok, I was refering to use them together
[09:18:16] <arschmitz> diosney: i would also say though its never a "bad idea" to use jquery mobile if you like it
[09:18:56] <arschmitz> diosney: right its very unlikely we will ever officially support using them together
[09:19:28] <diosney> arschmitz: ok, that's bad, while I searched I found that a lot of guys stepped away from using it because not working properly with angular (I don't found any updated references, tough)
[09:20:46] <diosney> arschmitz: thanks anyway
[09:23:31] <arschmitz> diosney: Your welcome
[10:28:53] <stevenelson> I’m having an issue with an external panel not swiping on an android device compiled with cordova.
[10:29:16] <stevenelson> it works fine in the browser and fine on ios, but android doesn’t like the swiping gesture. has anyone experienced this?
[10:30:37] <stevenelson> oh… this is in jquerymobile btw.
[10:49:35] <ldeluca> stevenelson: Try checking out the open issues on jquery-mobile in github. And if you don't see one go ahead and create a new issue with steps to reproduce your issue and I'll look into it
[10:50:01] <ldeluca> stevenelson: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[10:50:15] <stevenelson> sweet thanks ideluca. 
[11:04:01] <ianmaffett> stevenelson: Which browser are you testing on Android?  Chrome?
[11:04:30] <stevenelson> i’m compiling into a native app with apache cordova.
[11:05:44] <ianmaffett> Correct - you said the swipe worked fine in the browser
[11:05:55] <stevenelson> i’m still trying to debug when it happens. It seems to me that the swipe event is not firing when an external panel is on the screen. but… only on in native android.
[11:06:01] <ianmaffett> there's an issue with swipe on Android
[11:06:02] <stevenelson> in the browser i’m using chrome
[11:06:11] <ianmaffett> Yeah, google "fixed" it in Chrome 36
[11:06:13] <stevenelson> the latest version on a mac
[11:06:17] <ianmaffett> But Android stock browser has the issue
[11:06:25] <ianmaffett> What OS version of Android do you need to support?
[11:06:38] <stevenelson> as many as possible! :-)
[11:07:03] <ianmaffett> I work at Intel - we have a webview replacement called Crosswalk, but it's only Android 4+.  It's based off Chromium 37
[11:07:06] <ianmaffett> so it would fix the swipe issue
[11:07:28] <stevenelson> i did find that I can register touchmove events on the android just fine I may be able to fake the swipe event
[11:07:49] <ianmaffett> When you register the touchmove and do NOT call preventdefault, it causes issues then with scrolling and other events
[11:07:54] <ianmaffett> you have to "tap" the screen again to get it working properly
[11:08:10] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: stevenelson there is a potential fix for this i have not had time to imprement
[11:08:36] <ianmaffett> arschmitz: what is it?  I'd be interested in helping (if possible)
[11:09:00] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: you have to try to guess intent by the 2 events you get
[11:09:07] <arschmitz> the touch start and the touch cancel
[11:09:26] <arschmitz> you  based on those 2 events decide if the intent is more horizontal or vertical
[11:09:35] <arschmitz> if its horizontal you prevent default
[11:09:42] <stevenelson> ian, so should i call preventdefault, or not?
[11:10:39] <ianmaffett> arschmitz: I do that with App Framework, but if someone else has another event calling touchmove on the document, it causes problems
[11:12:58] <arschmitz> and kill scrolling
[11:12:58] <arschmitz> and trigger swipe
[11:13:21] <stevenelson> yikes. that could quickly become problematic as the panel has scrolling data. So if they were swiping up, but slightly diagonally it could kill the swipe. hmmm.
[11:13:31] <stevenelson> my hat is off to you all that work on this library!
[11:19:57] <arschmitz> iv talked with rick byers the head of input on the chrome team about this issue
[11:20:19] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: and that is the only way to fix this on the effected browsers
[11:20:19] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: but i have some issues with this aproach
[11:20:19] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: i dont like having to kill scrolling, i dont think you can judge intent well enough based on just two points
[11:20:42] <arschmitz> you have to do browser sniffing because ios acts completely different as well as newer chrome
[11:21:05] <ianmaffett> Yeah.  What we do is have users declare a class on the object and inspect off that
[11:21:07] <stevenelson> well, it may work as a temporary solution.
[11:21:27] <arschmitz> stevenelson: its not something i see us doing in the library
[11:21:29] <ianmaffett> sorry - on the DOM element
[11:21:47] <arschmitz> but yes you can work around it depending on your use case
[11:22:06] <arschmitz> in the library its bad because a common use is navigation and binding it to the whole document
[11:22:48] <stevenelson> i just wrote a quick script that sets a startX and startY on touchstart and sets endX and endY on touchmove. Then on touchend it subtracts the 4 numbers and they’re significantly different when you swipe left/right versus up/down.
[11:23:11] <arschmitz> ianmaffett: stevenelson: also once we adopt the pointer events polyfill we are working on this is a non issue
[11:23:27] <stevenelson> for example… this is a swipeleft: -103.125 -14.06298828125 the first number is the X distance the second is the Y distance
[11:23:45] <stevenelson> here is a swipeup: 1.5630035400390625 -209.37498474121094
[11:24:04] <stevenelson> that’s enough for me to determine intent.
[11:26:57] <arschmitz> stevenelson: predicting what real users will do is never that simple
[11:27:33] <arschmitz> stevenelson: what about small movements
[11:27:33] <arschmitz> stevenelson: and on ios there are a lot more much finer touchmove events
[11:27:33] <arschmitz> so you can use the same logic on ios and older android
[11:27:33] <arschmitz> stevenelson: note though the logic for swipe is extendable so you can shim it your self quite easily
[11:27:59] <arschmitz> stevenelson: what about when its diagnol
[11:28:11] <arschmitz> there is more then just swipe up and swipe down
[11:28:27] <arschmitz> and again thats only on android not ios
[11:28:41] <stevenelson> agreed. although in this case I’m focused on two panels. so swiping it closed should give gestures like that and I can make it only check for these events when those panels are open. I think it’ll work as a stopgap measure for now.
[11:29:05] <stevenelson> i’ll add in an android sniffer as the ios version works fine.
[11:29:32] <arschmitz> stevenelson: which is great for your use case but thats not something we can do in the library
[11:29:41] <stevenelson> agreed.
[11:33:56] <arschmitz> stevenelson: the logic is easily extendable for this very reason
[11:37:01] <stevenelson> for my usecase this logic is working fairly well… if (whichPanelIsOpen=='leftPanel' && distanceX < -60 && distanceY < 10 && distanceY > -10){
[11:37:01] <stevenelson>  			$( "#leftPanel" ).panel( "close" );
[11:37:02] <stevenelson> 		}
[11:37:21] <stevenelson> i hate hardcoding like that, but i think it’s solving the issue.
[11:37:42] <stevenelson> it still allows for vertical scrolling
[11:40:10] <stevenelson> oh this is weird. the touchend event doesn’t consistently fire.
[11:42:43] <arschmitz> stevenelson: http://api.jquerymobile.com/swipe/
[11:43:02] <arschmitz> stevenelson: you need to listen for touch cancel also
[11:43:27] <stevenelson> I tried that. the event didn’t fire when the external panel was open.
[11:44:00] <stevenelson> …on cordova compiled native android that is.
[11:44:25] <stevenelson> that swipe event does fire in google chrome on a mac and on ios 7.1

[11:51:13] <arschmitz> stevenelson: no im saying you should use the extension points there
[11:51:15] <arschmitz> stevenelson: to alter the swipe event to work how you want it
[11:53:43] <stevenelson> that’s what I tried and it wasn’t firing.
[11:54:05] <stevenelson> although… i was using “swipeleft”.. not “swipe” i’ll try that.
[11:56:35] <stevenelson> no luck.
[11:57:02] <stevenelson> this touchmove method is working fine for now, hopefully a more universal solution will get into the library in the future.
[11:57:07] <stevenelson> thank you all for the help!
[13:08:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Cool! (Re: UI stuff)

[14:08:05] <arschmitz> yes i think the new way should take presedence
[14:08:36] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[14:08:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Doing it that way.
[14:57:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think we should move links.js to popup.js
[15:30:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We should. Why?
[15:31:09] <gabriel_schulhof> .. and why popup? It seems so arbitrary O_o
[15:31:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, because it does the aria thing.
[15:33:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess part of popup's _create() could be to this.document.find( "a[href='#" + this.element.attr( "id" ) + "']" ).attr( "aria-haspopup", true ).attr( "aria-owns", this.element.attr( "id" ) ).attr( "aria-expanded", false );
[15:34:26] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof !ping
[15:34:41] <Omar-> regarding issue ##7784
[15:35:02] <Omar-> when device's orientation is changed, scroll is triggered
[15:35:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: OK.
[15:35:55] <gabriel_schulhof> I haven't had a chance to play with it yet.
[15:36:02] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/qagivo/2/
[15:36:41] <Omar-> left header's button is updated on scrollstop and represents scrollTop value
[15:36:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Do the fixed headers/footers need to be there for the problem to show itself?
[15:37:11] <Omar-> when you change orientation, right header's button posts a different value which also represent scollTop
[15:37:25] <Omar-> I use them for debugging
[15:38:11] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof he didn't mention using fixed toolbars http://stackoverflow.com/q/26431154/1771795
[15:38:54] <Omar-> hi arschmitz and lisa_deluca
[15:39:31] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof I guess unbinding scoll on orientationchange would solve the problem
[15:42:47] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/qagivo/3/ gabriel_schulhof updated bin
[15:43:05] <Omar-> tested on iPhone 5 and iPad 2 iOS 8.0.2 Safari
[15:43:28] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so this is only happening on iOS 8, it seems.
[15:43:46] <Omar-> maybe
[15:44:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I know iOS is notorious about triggering spurious resize events, so I wouldn't be surprised if our orientationchanged code might be getting confused.
[15:44:12] <Omar-> but he's using Samsung G s5
[15:44:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right.
[15:44:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, iOS8 and new Android then,
[15:44:40] <Omar-> haha
[15:44:49] <Omar-> they never stop playing around!
[15:44:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway ... I'll have to look at it over the weekend. I have no more brain cells left. It's 01:44 here.
[15:44:52] <Omar-> haha
[15:45:05] <Omar-> i'll test it on chrome mobile latest
[15:45:12] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Thanks!
[15:45:16] <Omar-> hmmmm

[15:45:51] <Omar-> Marbella, Spain
[15:45:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: No. It's one hour earlier where you live.
