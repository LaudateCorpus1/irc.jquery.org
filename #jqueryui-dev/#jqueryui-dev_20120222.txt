[05:03:31] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I am now
[05:04:10] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez. i was just looking for a review of my docs attempt but jzaefferer tore them apart for me in the PR :)
[05:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:04:21] <jzaefferer> kborchers: you're welcome!
[05:04:51] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i do appreciate it. is there any way to acutally test the output yet?
[05:05:10] <jzaefferer> just open the xml file in a browser
[05:05:19] <jzaefferer> the xslt is all linked up to output html
[05:05:24] <jzaefferer> save and refresh
[05:05:34] <kborchers> oh, duh. thanks
[05:05:46] <jzaefferer> if it outputs a blank page, run `ant` to get better error handling
[05:05:55] <jzaefferer> Chrome just outputs no errors at all
[05:06:13] <jzaefferer> with ant you get silly stacktraces, but usally there's a useful message in there
[05:06:28] <kborchers> cool, good to know
[05:08:40] <jzaefferer> should put that in the readme

[11:17:55] <gnarf> hrm
[11:18:19] <gnarf> hey - not ui related project i'm working on needs some tooltips
[11:18:28] <gnarf> and we were just talking about tooltip
[11:18:52] <gnarf> im wondering if the tooltip on master is ready to be used yet
[13:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's pretty stable.
[13:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'd feel comfortable using it. I wouldn't expect any API change.
[13:03:54] <gnarf> out of curiosity, has anyone ever thought about a way to change the tooltip content after its open?
[13:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> You can invoke the content method as many times as you want.
[13:05:23] <gnarf> roger
[13:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> So content: function( response ) { ... response( "foo" ); setTimeout(function() { response( "bar" ); }, 2000 ); }
[13:05:45] <gnarf> yeah
[13:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> We did that specifically for ajax content, so you can have a loading message.
[13:06:15] <gnarf> I'm thinking of a strange use case atm
[13:06:19] <gnarf> at least for tooltips
[13:06:33] <gnarf> so like, we have form fields, and when someone types invalid data - i want to update it's tooltip
[13:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> You should be able to do that.
[13:21:37] <gnarf> is there any convention for forcing a tooltip open in code instead of response to event?
[14:59:38] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you around?
[14:59:40] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/pm4JG/
[14:59:50] <gnarf> click on the body and tab through
[15:00:05] <gnarf> i'm wondering if the "blur" in tooltip for binding close should be a "focusout"
[15:00:19] <gnarf> since it binds focusin - but closes on blur
[15:00:31] <gnarf> which if you have the "title" on a container, wont catch you tabbing out of it
