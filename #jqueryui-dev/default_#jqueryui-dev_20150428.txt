[06:00:03] <agcolom> arschmitz: gabriel_schulhof: Hi, I'm updating the panel page on the api docs to add the external panel and fix small issues. I've noticed some classes do not have a description such as api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#option-classes.pageContainer
[06:01:15] <agcolom> sorry, here's the link http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#option-classes.pageContainer
[06:01:34] <agcolom> and http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#option-classes.pageFixedToolbar
[06:01:51] <agcolom> I've added the type, but a desc would be good
[09:34:45] <agcolom> arschmitz: ping
[09:34:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: Pong!
[09:35:02] <agcolom> hi, 
[09:35:20] <agcolom> did you see my message above? 
[09:35:51] <arschmitz> agcolom: i do now lol
[09:35:57] <agcolom> :-)
[09:36:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: but those will all be marked deprected in 1.5
[09:36:16] <arschmitz> they are misusing the classes option 
[09:36:27] <agcolom> yes, but it'd be good to have a desc for  http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#option-classes.pageContainer
[09:36:40] <agcolom> and http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#option-classes.pageFixedToolbar
[09:36:49] <agcolom> for the 1.4 doc?
[09:37:08] <arschmitz> the class applied to the page container an the class applied to any fixed toolbars

[11:42:44] <agcolom> thanks arschmitz :-)
[11:43:37] <agcolom> so I'll add the desc for these two. 
[11:44:41] <arschmitz> ok
[11:44:44] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:55:19] <agcolom> I'm confused though about the ones that say they don't do anything anymore
[11:58:16] <agcolom> arschmitz: so the ones that say they are no longer used in 1.4 didn't have a "deprecated" stage?
[11:58:35] <agcolom> So that's why we keep them in the 1.4 docs?
[11:58:42] <agcolom> e.g. classes.contentWrapOpen 
[12:07:55] <arschmitz> correct
[12:08:16] <arschmitz> the new theme required changes like that
[12:11:36] <agcolom> right, ok. So I can add the removed option to them and say removed="1.4"
[12:12:11] <agcolom> this adds " (version removed: 1.4) " in a warning div to the option

[12:14:54] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[12:17:07] <agcolom> I'll check later...
[13:12:04] <apsdehal> arschmitz: Ping
[13:12:48] <arschmitz> apsdehal: hi
[13:13:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: looks good
[13:13:26] <apsdehal> First of all, thanks for selecting me.
[13:13:34] <arschmitz> apsdehal: your welcome
[13:14:15] <apsdehal> So I have started some work, I wanted to ask if we have a browserstack account, or do we want to use saucelabs as they have free account for open source softwares.
[13:14:38] <arschmitz> we have a browserstack account
[13:15:02] <arschmitz> they are a foundation member :-)
[13:15:18] <apsdehal> Oh, didn't know that :)
[13:15:51] <apsdehal> Ok, then first I will get the intern-client get working, then we should move towards runner.
[13:16:19] <arschmitz> awesome
[13:17:31] <apsdehal> Do I need to do anything special for Community Bonding period? :p
[13:18:29] <arschmitz> i dont think so any time you can make meetings its good
[13:18:34] <arschmitz> i know time is bad ofr you though
[13:26:01] <apsdehal> Gruntfile is also in a messed up state now, it has grown too large. I was wondering if I should do a refactor of it using https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-modules
[13:56:23] <arschmitz> apsdehal: look at 1.5-dev
[13:56:27] <arschmitz> branch
[13:56:46] <arschmitz> apsdehal: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/Gruntfile.js
[13:58:09] <apsdehal> Yay, this one is pretty clean
[13:58:42] <apsdehal> I was going to format grunt tasks for intern and found that Gruntfile was very messy.
[13:59:32] <arschmitz> 1.5-dev is more or less master
[13:59:47] <arschmitz> but its where we are working on 1.5 because there are some things broken in there
[14:00:01] <arschmitz> thats where all the test cleanup is too
[14:01:10] <apsdehal> Should I work on 1.5-dev too?
[14:01:28] <arschmitz> if you want those changes :-) and to avoid an ugly rebase
[14:01:43] <arschmitz> the tests are much better there and the travis config too
[14:02:25] <apsdehal> Cool, I will checkout my branch from there. Anything else I should know?
[14:04:06] <arschmitz> i ont think so
