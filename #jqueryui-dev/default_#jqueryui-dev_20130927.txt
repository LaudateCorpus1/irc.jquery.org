[00:01:11] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[00:02:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, could be that class jqm-list is used as initSelector in one of the custom listview widgets we use in the demos
[00:03:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I want to look into our custom JS first
[00:03:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and remove everything that is not really needed so we can use demos for testing without having to worry about our custom JS being cause of issues we see

[03:29:40] <_|Nix|_> Uh-oh. Things have changed. You can no longer overwrite data.toPage on the second pagebeforechange (where the page is a jQuery object), because that call is being emitted only for backwards compatibility. However, this was possible in 1.3.2.
[03:30:04] <_|Nix|_> So, the PHP redirect demo is broken.
[03:30:15] <_|Nix|_> I need to figure out the new, non-deprecated way of implementing it.

[03:59:32] <uGoMobi> bergi9: yes, but data-role="panel" won't work unless you call new method $( "body" ).enhanceWithin();
[04:00:12] <uGoMobi> bergi9: or you can just call panel plugin: $( "#myPanel" ).panel();
[04:00:16] <uGoMobi> frequent: pong
[04:00:52] <frequent> uGoMobi: pingpong
[04:01:11] <uGoMobi> hey frequent what's up?
[04:01:37] <frequent> uGoMobi: I think I put everything on the issues list already :-)
[04:01:46] <frequent> uGoMobi: and
[04:01:55] <uGoMobi> ok, thanks
[04:02:01] <frequent> uGoMobi: wondering why panel needs to wrap ui-content
[04:02:12] <frequent> vs adding classes to ui-content
[04:02:25] <frequent> because it's quite a DOM shuffle
[04:04:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: we can look into that
[04:04:11] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I pushed a few commits to your pointer-events fork and commented on the wiki
[04:04:49] <frequent> uGoMobi: stumbled upon it when my iFrame started reloading once I opened/closed panel
[04:05:00] <uGoMobi> frequent: if you don't have fixed toolbars we include the toolbars in the wrapper, but we could do that the same as we do with fixed toolbars now
[04:05:02] <frequent> uGoMobi: so I was just wondering if that wrap is necessary 
[04:05:19] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, there was a ticket for that already
[04:05:28] <frequent> uGoMobi: sounds good
[04:05:59] <uGoMobi> other thing is that we set page theme on the wrapper
[04:06:32] <uGoMobi> but now we don't use gradients we could set that to ui-content as well
[04:06:32] <frequent> hm
[04:06:38] <frequent> ok
[04:07:33] <frequent> uGoMobi: I'm also currently trying to pre-enhance table and select. I could have a look at making those widgets data-enhanceable
[04:08:00] <frequent> uGoMobi: so if no one is doing it currently, assign it to me (table first)
[04:08:20] <uGoMobi> I think having your content inside ui-content is already required when using panels, so that's not an issue (in general you don't have to use ui-content on your page)
[04:08:43] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok great
[04:09:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: let's discuss with arschmitz and _|Nix|_ 
[04:09:10] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[04:09:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: those widgets aren't reviewed yet
[04:09:35] <uGoMobi> frequent: so might be good to look into who does what and when
[04:09:49] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok.
[04:10:00] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks for your help with that!
[04:10:07] <frequent> uGoMobi: np
[04:30:13] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i only glanced at your code but i also ran into issues with fireEvent â€¦ it only works with a certain list of events so onmousedown, onmouseup, etc.  it will not work with onpointerdown for example
[04:31:46] <kborchers> that's why i started work on the externalEventDispatcher to push that work off to jQuery. it's in a bad place (in the draggable demo) because i wasn't sure where it would actually live in our repos but here it is in case you haven't seen it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions-polymer/demos/draggable/jquery.polymer-dispatcher.js
[04:33:05] <bergi9> uGoMobi: force initializing panel before using .panel("open") works now but the background seems to be invisible, then i have to add ui-content classes in the panel content
[04:34:30] <uGoMobi> bergi9: right, you have to set a theme for any widget you use outside a page
[04:35:03] <uGoMobi> because there is no page as parent from which they can inherit
[04:35:20] <uGoMobi> bergi9: you don't need ui-content inside the panel
[04:35:58] <bergi9> the ul data-role="listview" didnt initalize in the panel
[04:37:08] <uGoMobi> yes, same as the panel
[04:37:30] <bergi9> then i have to initialize everything myself?
[04:37:42] <uGoMobi> bergi9: yes
[04:37:50] <uGoMobi> or you can use .enhanceWithin()
[04:38:01] <bergi9> then the jquerymobile beta 1.4 "Panel work outside of pages" isnt true at all
[04:38:10] <uGoMobi> why not?
[04:38:51] <bergi9> because i use it outside of page, and dont initialize itself
[04:38:58] <bergi9> like 1.3.2
[04:39:37] <uGoMobi> bergi9: well it doesn't say "Panel work outside of pages and initializes itself"
[04:40:26] <uGoMobi> bergi9: if you find that more convenient just call $( "body" ).enhanceWithin(); and you're done
[04:40:43] <uGoMobi> your panel and listview outside page will be enhanced
[04:41:17] <bergi9> enhangewithin() works, but the overlay of panel is invisible
[04:41:32] <bergi9> like .panel()
[04:41:37] <uGoMobi> did you set a theme?
[04:42:37] <uGoMobi> bergi9: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/panel-examples/
[04:42:45] <bergi9> setting themes myself? before it automatically select theme-a or c
[04:43:03] <uGoMobi> the left panel in that demo is outside the page
[04:43:25] <uGoMobi> bergi9: yes, before
[04:43:48] <uGoMobi> bergi9: but things can change in new versions
[04:43:57] <bergi9> ok, thank you so much
[04:44:03] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[04:46:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How important is it to get the PHP redirect demo working both the old way and the new way? Currently, the old way fails, and the new way requires a modification to the pagecontainer.
[04:46:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not important
[04:46:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Sorry! Gotta go!
[04:47:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just update the demo for 1.4 how you see fit
[04:47:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, later

[05:01:28] <bergi9> same result to uGoMobi
[05:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, I wonder what the difference is between the Mobile Safari UA and the iPhone UA.
[05:01:59] <uGoMobi> also ran it on iOS 7 / Chrome, same result
[05:02:18] <uGoMobi> let me try iPad with iOS 7
[05:02:37] <bergi9> my ipad only support ios5.1.1 :(

[05:05:56] <uGoMobi> more useful https://gist.github.com/matiaskorhonen/3013808
[05:07:33] <bergi9> uGoMobi: if i want splitview then i could use panels? (but only with own writted plugin to look it like splitview)
[05:10:18] <uGoMobi> bergi9: a splitview that remains visible?
[05:10:30] <uGoMobi> bergi9: not sure what you try to achieve
[05:10:54] <uGoMobi> bergi9: responsive push panel could be used for that
[05:11:41] <bergi9> i was thinking about fixed panel
[05:11:46] <uGoMobi> but panels were not really designed to stay open all the time
[05:12:13] <bergi9> hmm, then i will made own widget
[05:29:07] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yeah, I hadn't seen that. Good to know you were working on that, I didn't see that mentioned on the wiki page
[05:29:49] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, sorry i missed that. i'll add it
[05:30:25] <jzaefferer> do you see any way to integrate something into the polyfill? No externals or depending on jQuery?
[05:31:37] <kborchers> jzaefferer: no â€¦ after quite a bit of work and discussing with DaveMethvin and scott_gonzalez i think we came to this external event dispatcher as being the best way to do it without basically rebuilding jQuery's event system in polymer
[05:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> " I've noticed that neither JSFiddle or JS Bin reproduces this behavior similarly to how it behaves within a browser" WTF is this guy smoking?!?!?!?!?
[05:32:11] <kborchers> jzaefferer: but the idea is the hook allows for anyone to plug in any event dispatcher
[05:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> The hook comes from the polyfill, but the implementation has to be outside of the polyfill.
[05:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's the only sane solution.
[05:33:09] <kborchers> right, which is how i have started the implementation
[05:35:42] <kborchers> jzaefferer: so this https://github.com/kborchers/PointerEvents/blob/oldIE/src/mouse.js#L102 coupled with this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions-polymer/demos/draggable/jquery.polymer-dispatcher.js#L1 is how it is currently set up.  scope == window.PointerEventsPolyfill

[06:08:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: however ui selectmenu does not currently support multi select
[06:08:42] <uGoMobi> oh I see
[06:09:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they plan to add multi select support in the future with an extension

[06:21:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i commented on your checkbox icon issue
[06:22:26] <arschmitz> its easy to fix im just not sure if the class setup is intentional or not so if it needs to be fixed in css or js
[06:25:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it's CSS because it used to work, but I am not sure yet
[06:25:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: basicly it just depends on if you intend both classes to be needed or not
[06:27:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in the checkbox widget we also add ui-checkbox-on
[06:27:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes thats what i looked at
[06:27:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in selectmenu only ui-icon-checkbox-on
[06:27:34] <arschmitz> to make the icon work in checkbox it uses ui-icon-checkbox-on and ui-checkbox-on
[06:27:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right
[06:27:40] <uGoMobi> right
[06:27:42] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:27:57] <arschmitz> so if you intend both classes to be needed we need to fix in js in selectmenu to use both classes
[06:28:11] <arschmitz> if it should only need one class we need to adjust css
[06:28:29] <uGoMobi> not sure if people use ui-checkbox-on
[06:28:37] <arschmitz> not sure
[06:28:38] <uGoMobi> I don't think we ever documented it
[06:28:47] <arschmitz> i dont think so either
[06:43:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we should try to find all the accessability tickets we have open before the summit the week after next

[07:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9573
[08:39:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Bam! Found a solution without the need to modify the lib. Not only that, but it's really elegant.
[08:39:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for PHP redirect?
[08:39:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You simply call change() from pagecontainerbeforetransition.
[08:39:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, for the redirect.
[08:39:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice
[08:41:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that reminds me... what did we do with those event names in content / pagecontainer widget?
[08:41:23] <uGoMobi> the show and hide events
[08:46:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nothing, AFAIK.
[08:46:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's still pagecontainershow.
[08:47:42] <arschmitz> since api is not published yet therefore they are dont documented yet we can still change those
[08:49:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure, but to what?
[08:49:17] <emilsedgh_> uGoMobi: thank you for releasing beta1 :)
[08:49:28] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: and thanks to you for reverting back touch values
[08:49:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: pagecontainercontent(show|hide) and pagecontainercontentbefore(show|hide)?
[08:49:54] <emilsedgh_> but i still have one simple issue. when i enable swiperight or swipeleft events, normal scrolling becomes much harder.
[08:49:59] <emilsedgh_> using 1.4.0 beta1
[08:50:00] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: thanks, but it's a team and community effort :)
[08:50:23] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: no problem i agree 10px is far to little :)
[08:50:31] <emilsedgh_> uGoMobi: im sure it is, its just that you helped me the other day and im still appreciative
[08:50:43] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:50:49] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: when you say much harder what do you mean?
[08:50:51] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: i think it must be a different issue. 1.3 series had the same value but scrolling was just fine.
[08:51:16] <uGoMobi> emilsedgh_: you were testing on Android 4.2, right?
[08:51:19] <uGoMobi> or 4.3?
[08:51:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im not sure there is a better name those are much too long 
[08:51:26] <emilsedgh_> 4.2 uGoMobi
[08:51:31] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:51:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was just saying IF we want its still changeable
[08:51:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you have our note now right?
[08:51:52] <arschmitz> yeah i gave it to you in austin
[08:51:52] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: when it was 30px, scrolling events got detected as swipes. you reverted it back to 10px and those swipe events are gone.
[08:52:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How do pagecontainercontent(show|hide) and pagecontainercontentbefore(show|hide) sound?
[08:52:04] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: but i must try several times to scroll successfully
[08:52:17] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: you mean to scroll without triggering a swipe?
[08:52:36] <emilsedgh_> yes arschmitz. scrolling without triggering swipe is troublesome in 1.4
[08:52:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the end, so what if they're long? The key is that they exist *shrug*
[08:53:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: they sound very descriptive
[08:53:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure there is anything wrong with just show and hide the envents are just show and hide pagecontainer is just a prefix for what widget it is
[08:53:26] <uGoMobi> but very long too
[08:53:32] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: maybe i should go and come up with examples you can test instead of nagging here :)
[08:53:34] <arschmitz> and what else would it be showing and hiding besides its content
[08:53:49] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: no need i know the cause but its not a bug
[08:54:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Itself.
[08:54:05] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: in 1.3 swipe was triggered only after you lifted your finger from the screen
[08:54:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $( "#myElement" ).hide() will hide #myElement, not its contents.
[08:54:35] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: oh, thanks for explaining to me. go on.
[08:54:44] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: that was a bug as it deviated from native behivor we were trying to emulate
[08:54:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Despite that, I'm fine with leaving the event names as such.
[08:55:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: People will learn.
[08:55:17] <arschmitz> so now it is triggered once you have reached 30px in offest even if your finger is still on the screen

[08:56:14] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14d6e5d87 15Gabriel Schulhof: Demos: Navigation PHP redirect example: Update for 1.4.0.
[08:56:44] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: the problem here is it does not respect the vertical offset
[08:56:54] <emilsedgh_> oh
[08:57:07] <arschmitz> which is another bug we have been unable to fix because of support for certain older platforms with a worse bug
[08:57:16] <emilsedgh_> ah
[08:57:29] <emilsedgh_> i see
[08:57:42] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: its not 'that' bad though
[08:57:59] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: however we discussed just the other day revisiting this because those platforms are getting down to small enough numbers of users it might now make sense to flip flop and go to what will make MOST browsers behave correctly
[08:59:14] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: i have a repo that has a file that fixes this issue
[08:59:27] <arschmitz> thats documented in the demos however it needs to be updated for 1.4
[08:59:46] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: is the repo public?
[08:59:53] <arschmitz> yes
[09:00:16] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix
[09:00:23] <emilsedgh_> awesome :)
[09:00:41] <emilsedgh_> thanks a lot arschmitz.
[09:00:44] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: like i said though it needs to be update for 1.4 still
[09:01:07] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: no problem if you get ambitious feel free to submit a pr to update it :)
[09:01:18] <emilsedgh_> hehe
[09:01:30] * emilsedgh_ does not consider himself that good
[09:01:51] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: thats fine i plan on updateing before we release final just have not gotten to it yet
[09:05:02] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that thing about the external event dispatched was a rather critical piece of information to "withhold". I wasted a good hour or so digging around the dispatching. I had no idea there already was a descision to implement an external dispatcher...
[09:05:37] <emilsedgh_> arschmitz: thanks a lot. jquerymobile is awesome.
[09:05:56] <emilsedgh_> actually, i saw 1.4.0 alpha2, updated my app to it just to see how it works
[09:05:59] <emilsedgh_> and i was shocked
[09:06:04] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: glad you like it we all try very hard to make it the best it can be :)
[09:06:06] <emilsedgh_> it looks much mich better and feels much smoother
[09:06:29] <emilsedgh_> its so good i decided to stick with it
[09:06:31] <arschmitz> emilsedgh_: great to hear improving both the visual layout and the performance was a big goal for 1.4
[09:07:25] <emilsedgh_> kudos. goals seem achieved :)
[09:07:47] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah sorry about that â€¦ was definitely not intentional. it had been a while since i touched it and i just missed it :( the code was there and there is a commit just for the external event dispatcher hook but yeah, it's my bad for missing it in the wiki
[09:08:20] <jzaefferer> yeah, when I looked at the commits, I did not realise the significance of that change...
[09:08:45] <Mrgoose2> Anyone seen this error in jquery mobile 1.4 beta? Cannot set property 'mobile' of undefined

[12:35:03] <_|Nix|_> OK, so pagecontainer's load() needs to be able to handle the case of the options parameter being undefined.
[12:37:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The theme inheritance thing really shows on demos/swipe-page/buenosaires.html
[12:37:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: During the transition, the header has no theme.
[12:37:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... though I guess you could explicitly set a theme on the header, right?
[12:37:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup you have to now
[12:38:01] <arschmitz> those are old style persistant ones
[12:38:07] <uGoMobi> it's not an external header
[12:38:12] <arschmitz> so in the page but because they move out side the page
[12:38:25] <arschmitz> durring transtion if you dont set they lose theme
[12:38:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, wouldn't it be easier to move them outside the page?
[12:38:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes infact that style is deprecated
[12:38:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so another demo that needs updatin'.
[12:39:47] <uGoMobi> right, I forgot about the persistent header when updating that demo

[12:46:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[12:46:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think of it?
[12:47:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we should start with a simple demo without indent
[12:47:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it a little clearer than before? I removed the multi-level listviews.
[12:47:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah it's better already
[12:47:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, the thing is, I organized it such that it's indented by default. So, the indented demo has one less class than the flat demo.
[12:48:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Personally, I think flat collapsible listviews are confusing as heck. You never know which level you're looking at.
[12:48:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can use theme for that
[12:48:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not indefinitely.
[12:49:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But yeah, I guess if you have a deep enough tree, no matter what you do it's gonna get hard to find stuff.
[12:50:31] <uGoMobi> I think you should not want a collapsible menu with more than 2 levels
[12:51:05] <uGoMobi> how can a user keep overview when looking at that on a small mobile screen
[12:51:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's another reason things are indented by default. It is because to turn off indentation, you set some more values to 0.
[12:51:14] <uGoMobi> no matter how you style it
[12:51:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My whole custom CSS in that demo consists of turning things off.
[12:51:59] <uGoMobi> I suggest we do two demos
[12:52:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I turn them off by default, I have to override by turning them back on.
[12:52:10] <uGoMobi> this one and another basic one to start with
[12:53:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I don't like specifying things like padding-left: 1em; because the structure or the theme may have different values, and now I've created yet another place where you have to keep them in sync.
[12:54:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what I mean is this http://jsbin.com/upirol/79/edit
[12:54:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I actually had another level of complexity where lists could go like this:  indented (default) -> flat -> indented again (using overrides that had things like padding-left: 1em)
[12:54:35] <uGoMobi> just a very simple demo
[12:54:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i agree as simple as possible
[12:55:13] <uGoMobi> only 3 rules
[12:55:31] <arschmitz> i would even be ok with a few double borders to simplify the css
[12:55:32] <uGoMobi> nice for if you want a collapsible list menu in your panel or something
[12:56:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nah, I am sensitive when it comes to double borders ;-)
[12:57:00] <arschmitz> lol
[12:57:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man, I can't believe you avoided all those double borders with such few rules.
[12:57:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess I wrote my rules such that the lists are inset.
[12:58:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So I had to turn off a pile of borders.
[12:58:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But, I guess for flat lists you don't want inset.
[12:58:16] <uGoMobi> yeah I looked into the style options too
[12:58:50] <uGoMobi> those 3 rules work for all type... inset and non-inset list, with buttons inside or static list items
[12:59:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I got it.
[12:59:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll reduce my demo to not allow for the flat case.
[12:59:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And there'll be your demo to illustrate the flat case.
[12:59:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: ill set one up this weekend for doing the nested lists with dynamic pages
[12:59:59] <uGoMobi> so I think it's nice to start with something simple and then have one or two more complicated ones, like using indent
[12:59:59] <arschmitz> using the plugin i have in my repo
[13:00:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: pagecontainer has proven really elegant for the PHP redirect.
[13:00:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah the idea is its supposed to make interaction with nav much more sane
[13:00:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: During pagebeforetransition, if the page has a redirect, you simply prevent default and call .change()
[13:00:48] <arschmitz> by widgetizing it 
[13:00:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bam!
[13:01:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it needs some refinement still but its already a big imporvment
[13:01:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I loved using its public API.
[13:01:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No more overwriting data.toPage during pagebeforechange.

[13:02:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing that concerns me is whether pagebeforetransition is not too late for breaking off the page sequence and loading the redirect target.
[13:02:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I almost got panels working without wrapper
[13:03:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, the redirect page has undergone a whole pile of things to prepare it for being shown, and then I throw it out.
[13:03:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: only problem is a page with a non fixed footer
[13:03:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But anyway, the PHP redirect is probably a pretty minor use case.
[13:08:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah those are kinda a deal break though unless we come up with a better way to do it
[13:08:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that is honestly too late i think
[13:09:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should be BEFORE page load
[13:09:19] <arschmitz> so that your not loading the wrong page for no reason
[13:09:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: redirects should be done in pagecontainerbeforechange
[13:09:55] <arschmitz> and you should change the value of topage
[13:16:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You need to load the page to find out that it's a redirect.
[13:16:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is a client side redirect.
[13:16:19] <arschmitz> ohh right
[13:16:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That is, you load the page, you realize you don't want it, but you want another one instead.
[13:16:42] <arschmitz> couldnt you do it on pageload?
[13:16:57] <arschmitz> before the page is initalized?
[13:17:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, unfortunately, not without modifying the libary.
[13:17:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why?
[13:17:22] <arschmitz> what would need to be changeD?
[13:17:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because pagecontainer does not check whether the pagecontainerload default has been prevented or not.
[13:17:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You would need to check that.
[13:17:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well it should
[13:17:48] <arschmitz> so we should fix it
[13:18:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I can try to re-work it like that. I'll put it in a PR.
[13:21:55] <uGoMobi> OK if you apply a transform on an element that has position fixed on WP8, the element flies away :/
[13:22:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that sounds entertaining at least does it just disappear or actually fly off?

[13:23:52] <arschmitz> ohhh
[13:24:05] <arschmitz> i think i confirmed that on the 920 also right?
[13:24:06] <uGoMobi> tested without JQM http://jsbin.com/esekic/23/edit
[13:24:35] <uGoMobi> I can reproduce on HTC 8X and Lumia 520, but not on WP8 simulator
[13:25:03] <uGoMobi> so it looks like we can't fix it
[13:25:07] <arschmitz> so sim is useless and a very real problem
[13:25:24] <uGoMobi> also tested with only 5em and then it didn't happen
[13:25:40] <arschmitz> i wonder if it happens on surface
[13:25:54] <uGoMobi> looks like it needs an airstrip of at least 7em to be able to take off :D
[13:25:56] <arschmitz> or ie10 regular?

[13:45:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but I think in Chrome it's a rendering glitch, because the CSS tells me it has the right border.
