[07:02:21] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez arschmitz: I've been wondering how to test UI with jQuery 3.0+
[07:02:35] <m_gol> so far UI has a few Jenkins jobs, one per minor
[07:03:15] <m_gol> but since jQuery 3.0 we'll be releasing minors more often than in the past as anything that qualifies as even a small new feature mandates a minor bump according to semver
[07:03:21] <m_gol> as well as deprecations etc.
[07:03:40] <m_gol> do you still want to keep a job per 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 etc. or would one job per major suffice?
[07:04:06] <m_gol> there will be only one 3.0.x, most likely only two 3.1.x (we plan 3.2.0 after 3.1.1) etc.
[07:05:28] <m_gol> I see you've added Core 3.1 to various places in the setup but no tests are running on that in Jenkins since I'd have to create a job for Core 3.1 first. That's one of the reasons I'm asking; I think this would require adding new jobs more often than I'd like
