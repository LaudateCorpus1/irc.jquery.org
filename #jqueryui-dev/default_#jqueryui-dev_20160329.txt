[18:05:02] <leobalter> that's great, @apsdehal!
[18:05:25] <apsdehal> leobalter: I also had a question
[18:06:00] <apsdehal> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/accordion/core.js#L120
[18:06:10] <apsdehal> In this test, when we upgrade this.
[18:06:24] <apsdehal> We will change asyncTest to QUnit.test
[18:06:39] <apsdehal> Do we also need to replace QUnit.start with assert.async
[18:06:55] <apsdehal> Or is it still supported with since QUnit.config.autostart is false
[18:07:43] <leobalter> QUnit.start is now meant to work on config.autostart uses, asyncTests will need to use assert.async
[18:08:24] <apsdehal> Ok so whatever the case if QUnit.start is inside asyncTest it should be replaced with assert.async
[18:08:38] <apsdehal> I need to update api of migrator little bit then
