[01:44:04] <AmirHossein> hi friends, i have a problem, i want change select menu selected, i found this $('selectmenu').val('somevalue').selectmenu('refresh'); but not work.
[01:45:09] <AmirHossein> friends?
[02:08:24] <AmirHossein> friends??
[05:34:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Ping!
[06:30:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[06:30:44] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: When you get a chance you you try to review some of my PR's
[06:30:53] <arschmitz> i have 15 open ones lol and im working on more
[06:30:53] <gabrielschulhof> Sure!
[06:30:59] <gabrielschulhof> Woah!
[06:31:45] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: trying to get PR's for the bulk of the remaining open 1.5 issues
[06:31:50] <arschmitz> most are fairly trivial
[06:32:28] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'm making progress with the popup. I've added tests for the backcompat, but only the arrow so far, because the popup itself uses the generic widget backcompat in a straight-forward way, so tests against the widget backcompat itself should cover that. Only the popup arrow overrides some of the backcompat functionality.
[06:33:08] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: you should still have a simple test making sure the classes are applied to the correct elelment
[06:33:19] <arschmitz> since you just give it a key
[06:33:32] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess I can make sure that the key is set correctly.
[06:33:50] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: ... and in my case the value, too, because it applies ui-overlay-shadow, not ui-shadow.
[06:34:07] <gabrielschulhof> I'll add those assertions to the backcompat test.
[06:34:08] <arschmitz> yup
[06:34:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: just something simple like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.5-dev/tests/unit/flipswitch/flipswitch_backcompat.js
[06:34:23] <arschmitz> to make sure things are applied where they should be
[06:34:50] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: ... and I don't think you have to especially turn off backcompat in the tests. You can simply omit including the popup.*backcompat AMD module.
[06:35:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: turning it off effects other partsof the lib
[06:35:17] <arschmitz> like the enhancer
[06:35:27] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah! OK, right.
[06:35:41] <gabrielschulhof> So, aside from the backcompat tests, it'll be off.
[06:35:56] <arschmitz> yes
[06:38:16] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Are we sure $( window ).height() now works correctly on all supported devices âœ• all supported versions of core?
[06:38:38] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: we could never confirm there was a bug in the first place
[06:38:59] <gabrielschulhof> OK, cuz I remember having a hack in popup as well. If this is the case, I'll remove that as well.
[06:39:29] <arschmitz> This is why support comments are important lol
[06:39:41] <arschmitz> and proper commit messages
[06:41:05] <gabrielschulhof> Aaaaw, d00d, that must've felt good, lopping off all that deprecated stuff ... feels good reviewing the loppings :)
[06:44:22] <arschmitz> yup thats all the deprecated code issues
[06:46:33] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: We still have a way of accessibly hiding stuff after removing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8179/, right?
[06:46:53] <arschmitz> ui-helper-hidden-accessable
[06:47:20] <arschmitz> that class was specific to fieldcontains
[07:20:31] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: What's the oldest version of jQuery that we support?
[07:20:38] <arschmitz> 1.8
[07:21:09] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK, then I need to check if 1.8 returns 0 for an absent tabindex attribute.
[07:21:14] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8173/files#diff-2bab321c0a39abf03c5a7f08284acc8bL291
[07:21:41] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I used the native .getAttribute() because core's .attr() was returning 0 instead of undefined when tabindex was absent.
[07:21:48] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: 0c0726c61da4726d83b15fedbceb5e4d1435d03c
[07:22:43] <arschmitz> ok
[07:24:59] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Looking good: http://jsbin.com/nadito/
[07:29:11] <gabrielschulhof> I fscking hate jsbin! WTF was wrong with the way it was handling milestones before? Now, I hit Ctrl+S or click on save milestone, and it continues to modify the same milestone. Grrrrrr!
[07:29:26] <arschmitz> yup
[07:29:34] <arschmitz> you can do it twice to create a new one
[07:30:38] <gabrielschulhof> I fscking typed in http://output.jsbin.com/nadito/4/edit, made a modification, then loaded http://output.jsbin.com/nadito/4/ - yep, there it is, then I went back to http://output.jsbin.com/nadito/, and lo and behold, it's there too!
[07:31:07] <arschmitz> that sounds like a bug
[07:31:44] <gabrielschulhof> That's it - screw jsbin. I'm making clones from now on. May the Flying Spagetti Monster have mercy on their address space.
[07:40:22] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: csscomb/csslint seem to do more than just style changes: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8172/files#diff-383c283990c71af01325331d1e103ab2L21 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8172/files#diff-383c283990c71af01325331d1e103ab2L253
[07:40:49] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Is the result equivalent to the original in terms of rules?
[07:41:16] <arschmitz> It fails style checks this is an expiramental unsupported rule, the contained declration however, is fine to apply to all browsers based on my testing / the issue history
[07:41:21] <arschmitz> i changed that by hand
[07:41:41] <arschmitz> same with the font size
[07:42:06] <gabrielschulhof> OK *shrug* ... I guess it must be grabbing the font size via inheritance from somewhere.
[07:42:08] <arschmitz> we were failing style checks because we declared the same font size in thesame file 5 times :-/
[07:42:16] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no i did that by hand
[07:42:36] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so you introduced inheritance for the mini font size to clean up the CSS ... correct?
[07:42:38] <arschmitz> just like jscs it will find things it cant fix
[07:42:56] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: all i did is abstract it to its own rule
[07:43:01] <arschmitz> its not changing inheritance
[07:44:01] <gabrielschulhof> OK, then there's https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8172/files#diff-454473e1e204c92c45f21a06a5663c4eL213 ... that seems like an arbitraray removal. Does it have no effect?
[07:44:29] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: its invalid
[07:44:40] <arschmitz> there is no such thing as min-height: auto
[07:44:57] <arschmitz> so it was not doing anything
[07:45:08] <arschmitz> there is a similar one with margin
[07:45:31] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Cool!
[07:45:55] <arschmitz> yeah some of those change though purely style i guess do require some explination lol
[07:46:33] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Well, margin: 0 should be OK, because margin: 25px is OK ...
[07:46:49] <gabrielschulhof> Talkin' 'bout https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8172/files#diff-665c989604edf0d6acec41884ed8b5b1L58
[07:47:08] <gabrielschulhof> Unless of course it's superfluous in that spot because the margin is already 0.

[07:47:29] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: margin is invalid with display table-cell
[07:47:37] <arschmitz> so it was not doing anything
[07:48:17] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, there's a display table-cell there. OK. NM then.
[07:48:47] <gabrielschulhof> Then there's a bunch of weird indentations aroung https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8172/files#diff-be2cdbd1b829152bea9d67c68d55e31fR2
[07:48:51] <gabrielschulhof> around
[07:49:13] <gabrielschulhof> Why not {\n\topacity: 0;\n}
[07:49:19] <gabrielschulhof> ?
[07:49:23] <arschmitz> to be honest im not sure
[07:49:30] <arschmitz> that was done automatticly
[07:49:36] <gabrielschulhof> We never use that kind of formatting.
[07:49:47] <gabrielschulhof> Will it accept {\n\t?
[07:49:53] <arschmitz> it should
[07:50:20] <arschmitz> the first file in the diff allows you to set that stuff
[07:50:26] <arschmitz> .csscomb.json
[07:51:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah it has " " for space after opening brace
[07:51:21] <arschmitz> wait no it does not
[07:51:32] <arschmitz> it has /n that looks like a bug in css comb maybe
[07:51:51] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, I think so. I was gonna say that goes against the setting ...
[07:52:10] <gabrielschulhof> Maybe they have an off-by-one error or something.
[07:52:13] <arschmitz> its a weird case
[07:52:17] <arschmitz> since its nested
[07:52:57] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: It'll get real annoying real quick if you indent it properly by hand, and then csscomb reindents it incorrectly upon the next run :/
[07:53:19] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i would just go with what csscomb does for now probably
[07:53:33] <arschmitz> at least its enforcable and we can file a bug
[07:53:43] <gabrielschulhof> OK *shrug*
[07:54:00] <gabrielschulhof> Definitely a bug though. It seems to do that everytime the rule consists of a single property.
[07:54:01] <arschmitz> and its a pretty specific special case with the css transitions
[07:54:11] <arschmitz> oh is that it 
[07:54:20] <arschmitz> hmm let me see if there is a special setting for that
[07:54:44] <gabrielschulhof> That certainly seems to be the common theme among all the mis-formatted rules.
[07:55:17] <gabrielschulhof> I'm curious ... do we have any one-property rules elsewhere beside transitions?
[07:55:26] <arschmitz> we must
[07:55:49] <gabrielschulhof> Well, it's not botching those then ... :/
[07:55:56] <gabrielschulhof> Or rather O_o
[07:56:11] <arschmitz> i think its single line nested rules
[07:56:15] <arschmitz> specificly
[07:56:28] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, might be.
[08:00:43] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js/issues/396
[08:01:49] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thats the opposite they are trying to do single line
[08:02:15] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: maybe this though https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js/issues/350
[08:02:17] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, but the result is the same.
[08:02:36] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: but our closing brace is correct
[08:02:39] <arschmitz> the opening one is wrong
[08:02:51] <arschmitz> their closing is wrong and their opening is correct
[08:03:38] <arschmitz> i think its this its ignoring that it should be \n 
[08:03:40] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah. It's actually a totally different issue.
[08:03:43] <arschmitz> and we do use a sort order
[08:03:58] <arschmitz> https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js/issues/350 i think its this
[08:04:54] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... if it's because of sort order, it should also affect non-nested one-liners.
[08:05:06] <arschmitz> did we have any
[08:05:14] <arschmitz> we should never have really had one liners
[08:05:15] <gabrielschulhof> Ugh ... difficult to check.
[08:05:55] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: what do you think of http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-3rd-party/demos/
[08:06:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Well, all our icons are one-liners.
[08:06:39] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: They just have background-image and that's it.
[08:06:42] <arschmitz> hmm i dunno then
[08:07:42] <gabrielschulhof> Since you have the configuration and the incorrect output on hand, can you file a bug and point suspiciously at https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js/issues/350? :)
[08:08:34] <gabrielschulhof> ... though I suppose I could make a small test case ...
[08:12:28] <arschmitz> i can
[08:14:32] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Thanks!

[08:16:36] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, right. Sorry!
[08:16:51] <arschmitz> trying to address the 3rd party demos issue
[08:17:03] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, nice!
[08:17:16] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, a section on the landing page should definitely do them justice.
[08:18:04] <gabrielschulhof> Weird - the Popup Datepicker does not pop up :/
[08:18:25] <arschmitz> must have broke something
[08:18:43] <gabrielschulhof> ... at some point ... I wonder where this broke. I doubt it's this PR.
[08:18:53] <arschmitz> ill figure it out
[08:19:01] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'll make an issue.
[08:19:26] <arschmitz> works on master
[08:19:51] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[08:20:14] <gabrielschulhof> Not on 1.5-dev though. So, that's good.
[08:20:19] <arschmitz> yup
[08:20:39] <arschmitz> i probably need to update datepicker
[08:20:46] <arschmitz> for 1.5
[08:21:31] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: the side menu changed a lot too
[08:21:34] <arschmitz> if you didnt notice
[08:21:36] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: There you go: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8183
[08:21:42] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #8183: Datepicker: Popup demo broken on 1.5-dev 02http://git.io/vqkSE
[08:22:05] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and the header too actually
[08:23:07] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ... I kinda liked the previous incarnation better ... you could tell which expands and which takes you to a new page, whereas now you can't tell.
[08:23:23] <arschmitz> i didnt change that
[08:23:42] <arschmitz> i didnt change the style i just re-arranged
[08:23:47] <gabrielschulhof> Also, expanding "Pages" is OK, but expanding "Widgets" results in a double border underneath "Widgets"
[08:24:02] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll file issues.
[08:24:11] <arschmitz> oh
[08:24:16] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: collapsible is not updated
[08:24:22] <arschmitz> there is a pr for it
[08:24:24] <arschmitz> so icons dont work
[08:24:44] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[08:24:48] <arschmitz> same with listview
[08:24:49] <gabrielschulhof> That should probably fix it then.
[08:24:59] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, dude! Listview is still out there.
[08:25:02] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: well we need to switch
[08:25:05] <arschmitz> to accordion
[08:25:08] <gabrielschulhof> *whew* ... 
[08:25:14] <arschmitz> once sfrisk submits her PR
[08:25:31] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: didnt you already have a listview PR?
[08:25:54] <arschmitz> if not ill do it
[08:26:05] <gabrielschulhof> Yes, I did, but it's woefully out-of-date by now, with all the new procedures we've adopted wrt. widget review.
[08:26:35] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ill do listview then
[08:26:45] <arschmitz> there are a few related listview issues i can tackle at the same time
[08:27:25] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and you have a lot of PR's working already
[08:27:27] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/gabrielschulhof/jquery-mobile/tree/7692-listview-classes-option-2
[08:28:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/597cd5cb26b436cdd380437d1aa61b890b430013...gabrielschulhof:7692-listview-classes-option-2
[08:28:54] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Make sure you include frequent's commit.
[08:29:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: that does not look that out of date
[08:30:01] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: There's a lot of sed work replacing class names.
[08:30:02] <arschmitz> it uses the current API
[08:30:18] <gabrielschulhof> OK, then I'll warm it up :)
[08:30:48] <arschmitz> yeah this does not look like it needs too much
[08:30:52] <gabrielschulhof> I'll finish off popup, which only needs the style option checks to be ready for another review, and then I'll revisit.
[08:30:57] <arschmitz> hard with out a diff but yeah
[08:31:03] <arschmitz> awesome
[08:31:18] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: though id rather see you revisit selectmenu first
[08:31:25] <arschmitz> because that breaks controlgroup
[08:31:44] <gabrielschulhof> How do you mean without a diff? There's a diff at the bottom of that compare URL - or did you mean that for something else?
[08:32:10] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so ... finish off popup, then selectmenu, then listview. /0
[08:32:17] <arschmitz> yes
[08:32:32] <arschmitz> oh i didnt see you give the compare
[08:32:40] <arschmitz> i was just looking at your branch
[08:33:01] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, it's the long, ugly URL from 4 minuts ago.
[08:33:29] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/597cd5cb26b436cdd380437d1aa61b890b430013...gabrielschulhof:7692-listview-classes-option-2
[08:33:47] <arschmitz> yeah i mean its not done but it looks like 75% at least
[08:34:00] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... the class renames really spam the diff :/
[08:34:34] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, cool! I'd gotten around to adding the backcompat. Nice!
[08:34:38] <arschmitz> the biggest thing i see missing is backcompat tests
[08:34:45] <arschmitz> skimming the diff real quick
[08:35:12] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. ... and making sure all the extensions play nice with each other and with backcompat - though those are mostly functional extensions, unaffected by style.
[08:35:26] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:35:38] <gabrielschulhof> OK. *crack knuckles*
[08:36:24] <gabrielschulhof> I still need to figure out one weird sequence in popup, where you turn off/on shadow via classes, than, while the shadow is on, you set the shadow option to true, then you set the shadow option to false, and it does not take off the shadow.
[08:36:50] <arschmitz> odd
[08:36:54] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, totally.
[08:37:15] <arschmitz> im not sure with how the backcompat works how that happens
[08:37:23] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: one thing to be careful of though
[08:37:35] <gabrielschulhof> Well, let's just blame me until proven otherwise :)
[08:37:37] <arschmitz> is classes pre added to the demo markup that conflict with the options being set
[08:38:03] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's the dev's responsibility to be consistent.
[08:38:07] <arschmitz> basicly every controlgroup in the demos has invalid markup the old widget was fixing with out realizing 
[08:38:52] <gabrielschulhof> for enhanced we even document that, if you submit markup that represents a non-default value for an option, you must set that option on the widget to the value represented by the initial markup.
[08:39:03] <arschmitz> yes
[08:39:13] <arschmitz> every button in every controlgroup has ui-corner-all on it 
[08:39:17] <arschmitz> in the demos
[08:39:30] <arschmitz> and obviously no button in a controlgroup should have corner classes on it at all
[08:39:39] <gabrielschulhof> Isn't that because the radiuses were getting zeroed out in CSS?
[08:39:53] <arschmitz> yes
[08:40:22] <gabrielschulhof> Well, then it kinda makes sense, because, if you yank a button out of a controlgroup and stick it somewhere on its own, it has corners.
[08:40:32] <gabrielschulhof> ... automagically.
[08:40:48] <arschmitz> right but why would you move the same button around on a page like that?
[08:41:01] <arschmitz> and either way its inconsistent between the option and the markup
[08:41:08] <arschmitz> the option says it does not have corners
[08:41:15] <arschmitz> and the markup says it does
[08:41:36] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, definitely. New way's better.
[08:43:36] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: so how do you feel about the smaller header on demos
[08:43:43] <arschmitz> and the re-organized nav
[08:44:32] <arschmitz> i think it makes it a lot easier to find what your looking for in the nav and the deprecated can be mixed into the normal menu to make it easier for people to find them but they are CLEARLY 3rd party with the background and the warning
[08:44:40] <arschmitz> not deprecated
[08:44:43] <arschmitz> 3rd party
[08:45:01] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I don't have much of a sense of aesthetics, but I do have a gut feeling for clunky. There's some clunkiness now, but only because of the broken collapsible.
[08:45:06] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. That's good.
[08:45:14] <gabrielschulhof> ... and the menu is shorter.
[08:45:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:45:25] <arschmitz> the collapsibles we will fix
[08:45:33] <arschmitz> but its the same on 1.5-dev thats not a change
[08:45:35] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, so I can look past that.
[08:45:47] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-dev/demos/
[08:47:10] <arschmitz> my goal was to bring a lot more above the fold
[08:47:24] <gabrielschulhof> "above the fold"?
[08:47:51] <arschmitz> see a higher % of content without scrolling
[08:48:06] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, right. Yeah.
[08:48:09] <arschmitz> the fold is the bottom of the screen when it loads with out scrolling
[08:48:37] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, we should definitely endeavour not to waste real estate.
[08:48:49] <arschmitz> like the huge image there now
[08:48:53] <arschmitz> is a big waste
[08:49:02] <arschmitz> the overside header i think is too much too
[08:49:03] <gabrielschulhof> While, of course, not crowding either. </sense-of-aesthetics>
[08:49:06] <arschmitz> oversize
[08:49:38] <arschmitz> and iv always thought it was too hard to find what your looking for in the side nav so i think breaking it into larger groupings will help
[08:49:49] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... I dunno at what size the visual impact of the logo starts to saturate.
[08:50:10] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: all i did is remove the media query that made it bigger on desktop
[08:50:19] <arschmitz> so it now always uses the "mobile" size header
[08:50:31] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, so mobile is not actually different then.
[08:50:39] <arschmitz> right
[08:51:07] <gabrielschulhof> Well, I'm not too worried about the landing page though. Chances are people are gonna skim over the whole thing anyway, so even things below the fold should catch their eye.
[08:51:35] <arschmitz> right
[08:51:37] <gabrielschulhof> Which is not to say that it's not worth bringing important things to the top.
[08:52:04] <arschmitz> i think it was a little clunky with the stuff above the boxes before
[08:52:08] <arschmitz> too biug
[08:52:29] <arschmitz> when ever jasper and sfrisk are around ill ask them too
[08:52:36] <arschmitz> they are better designers then us lol
[08:53:23] <gabrielschulhof> Amen to that.
[08:53:57] <sfrisk> hrm?
[08:54:19] <arschmitz> sfrisk: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-3rd-party/demos/ vs http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-dev/demos/
[08:55:14] <sfrisk> So the one with the larger image is a little awkward because you have all that white space on the right
[08:55:28] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yeah thats the current one
[08:55:35] <arschmitz> the first one is what i propose to change it to
[08:55:51] <sfrisk> That could work
[08:56:03] <arschmitz> it shrinks the header
[08:56:04] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I think I got it. classes[ "ui-popup" ] = "ui-corner-all ui-overlay-shadow ui-overlay-shadow";
[08:56:10] <arschmitz> and cleans up the side nav too
[08:56:27] <gabrielschulhof> It should never end up that way.
[08:57:06] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ... before pushing into classArray, we oughta check whether it's already there :/
[08:57:30] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah though core should de-dup it i thought
[08:58:13] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, yeah, upon actually setting the class, yes, but it's stored duped in the option, and removing it from the option is necessary in order for the classes option to become in sync with the style option.
[08:58:18] <gabrielschulhof> So, we also need to de-dupe.
[08:58:24] <arschmitz> ohh right
[08:58:43] <arschmitz> sfrisk: totally open to suggestions on that page
[08:58:47] <arschmitz> just trying to clean it up some
[08:58:51] <gabrielschulhof> Or, rather, we need to take the burden from core, because it must be consistent before it ends up in the DOM.
[08:59:11] <arschmitz> eah
[08:59:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:59:21] <arschmitz> simple enough to add an inArray check
[08:59:34] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: So, how d'you wanna handle this? PR against 1.5-dev, or should I just stick it on the popup PR?
[09:00:07] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: do it on 1.5 dev
[09:00:15] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, like push to it without PR?
[09:00:38] <arschmitz> sure
[09:00:41] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[09:00:42] <arschmitz> i trust you
[09:00:46] <arschmitz> and we can always rebase 1.5
[09:01:02] <arschmitz> infact its pretty likely this commit will get rebased in the end anyway into another
[09:01:10] <sfrisk> I trust no one
[09:01:17] <sfrisk> but that's me
[09:01:26] <arschmitz> lol
[09:01:47] <arschmitz> sfrisk: i do when i have the power to retroactively re-write their history  :-)
[09:02:05] <sfrisk> true
[09:05:24] <gabrielschulhof> ?BOOM
[09:05:27] <gabrielschulhof> That fixed it.
[09:14:03] <gabrielschulhof> ... but it broke the backcompat tests ... weird ...
[09:15:54] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh* ... not !$.inArray(), but $.inArray() === -1
[09:20:00] <arschmitz> lol
[09:20:18] <arschmitz> iv done that tons of times
[09:20:46] <gabrielschulhof> It makes sense, gramatically, like "not in array" - but alas ...
[09:21:04] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ... it /could/ return, like, oh, I dunno, false instead of -1.
[09:21:10] <gabrielschulhof> No. Wait.
[09:21:12] <gabrielschulhof> NM.
[09:21:15] <gabrielschulhof> 0 is also falsy.
[09:32:28] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: its because its a direct analog of indexOf
[09:34:22] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, but there's no real way to check using the ! operator, precisely because 0 is also among the falsy values. 
[09:34:57] <gabrielschulhof> ... even if it weren't. As soon as it needs to also return a number if found, and as long as indices start with 0, and as long as 0 counts as falsy, you can't use !.
[09:35:44] <gabrielschulhof> Anyhoo ... tests are appropriately verdant, so I should be pushing to 1.5-dev soon.
[09:36:16] <arschmitz> cool

[09:39:53] <arschmitz> and i trusted you...

[19:14:52] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: The datepicker demo was simply out of date it was using jQuery UI datepicker 1.10 ( current is 11.4 ) and mobile wrapper 1.1 wrapper ( current is 1.9 )
[19:15:07] <arschmitz> bumping the versions of both fixes the errors
