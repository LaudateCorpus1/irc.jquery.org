[05:01:05] <gnarf> rworth: you here?
[05:01:10] <rworth> hey
[05:01:27] <rworth> gnarf: what's up?
[05:01:35] <gnarf> I've been trying to figure out how best to integrate globalize with timepicker
[05:01:46] <gnarf> and there are a few sticking points at the moment
[05:01:59] <gnarf> got a few to chat about it sometime today?
[05:02:01] <rworth> sure
[05:02:07] <gnarf> now? later?
[05:03:23] <rworth> now works
[05:03:28] <gnarf> cool
[05:03:41] <gnarf> so - first off - Globalize only has the "one format" for time
[05:04:24] <gnarf> currently, we have the ability to use 24hr / 12hr formats, with or without seconds
[05:04:42] <gnarf> I assume with/without seconds could be implemented by just stripping :ss from the mask
[05:05:13] <gnarf> also, I'm curious how I can just get the current locale's values for am/pm
[05:05:24] <gnarf> and/or the timestamp
[05:06:40] <rworth> by values for am/pm, you mean the translation for AM or PM?
[05:06:54] <gnarf> yup
[05:07:11] <gnarf> but id like the whole array of "valid" values for am/pm too
[05:07:26] <rworth> that's in the culture's calendars.standard.AM and calendars.standard.PM
[05:07:43] <gnarf> how do i get the calendars?
[05:08:57] <rworth> it's in the culture object returned by Globalize.culture( selector )
[05:09:23] <gnarf> hrm
[05:09:42] <gnarf> so does it make sense to take a "culture" option for timepicker?
[05:09:56] <gnarf> or is there a way to get the "current" culture?
[05:11:19] <rworth> if you don't pass a selector to .culture() it will return the current culture
[05:12:21] <gnarf> so, calendar = Globalize.culture().calendar
[05:12:23] <gnarf> ?
[05:13:55] <gnarf> cool
[05:14:12] <gnarf> any thoughts on supporting forcing 24hr / 12hr
[05:14:37] <rworth> how so?
[05:16:53] <gnarf> well, if we want to support { ampm: true } but globalize has "HH:mm:ss"
[05:16:58] <gnarf> for instance
[05:17:12] <gnarf> t = time without seconds, T = time with seconds
[05:17:16] <gnarf> so thats convinient....
[05:20:02] <gnarf> oh - wb rworth - sent you the log of my text since the last thing you said
[05:20:07] <gnarf> via skype...
[05:20:08] <rworth> gnarf: sorry, my client needed a restart. Thanks
[05:22:51] <gnarf> seems de-DE is a good example
[05:24:00] <rworth> can you describe what it is you want to be able to allow/not allow? Do you mean that when you have a culture that only uses 24hr clock you want the user to be able to use AM/PM or not use AM/PM?
[05:24:28] <gnarf> basically, the widget takes an ampm option
[05:25:04] <gnarf> If I want to support the "cultural default"
[05:25:04] <rworth> so that only makes sense for cultures that have AM/PM values
[05:26:00] <rworth> are you trying to figure out what the default value for the ampm option should be, or whether it should be overriden by the current culture, or what to do in case they're not compatible?
[05:26:14] <gnarf> yes, yes, and yes :)
[05:26:18] <rworth> :)
[05:27:00] <rworth> I wonder if it would make sense to default to "auto" meaning use the culture
[05:27:06] <rworth> then you can override if you want
[05:27:17] <rworth> and if your override isn't supported by the culture, tuff
[05:28:16] <gnarf> i like "auto"
[05:28:45] <gnarf> if there aren't values for am/pm in the culture, it could resort to using "am"/"pm" again i suppose
[05:29:20] <rworth> if there aren't values for am/pm in the culture, shouldn't it use a 24hr clock?
[05:29:42] <rworth> am/pm doesn't make sense to someone entering time from a culture that doesn't have am/pm
[05:33:26] <gnarf> makes sense
[05:33:35] <gnarf> of course, so long as its documented
[05:33:40] <rworth> right
[05:33:48] <gnarf> and maybe offer a culture: false option to disable it
[05:34:20] <gnarf> like if for some reason you wanted to force a specific format for your database
[05:34:41] <gnarf> but had Globalize around for datepicker on some other page
[05:35:05] <rworth> any specific format could be arrived at later
[05:35:12] <rworth> shouldn't force the user to do that
[05:35:55] <gnarf> expand that thought? not quite sure i'm following
[05:36:29] <rworth> if the user only knows about 24hr clocks, let them enter a time in a 24hr clock format
[05:36:53] <rworth> if your back-end needs are such that you want am/pm, then convert (parse and format)
[05:37:31] <rworth> I don't see a reason why the developer should say "I want the user to enter time using am/pm even though I'm telling the system they're from a culture that doesn't have such a thing"
[05:37:44] <gnarf> alright
[05:37:47] <gnarf> i can agree
[05:37:59] <gnarf> i'm just skeptical atm i guess for some reason
[05:38:07] <gnarf> i can't put my finger on
[05:38:31] <gnarf> I think I can get this Globalize integration in shortly...
[05:39:01] <gnarf> also - there is the issue right now of a "raw value"
[05:39:29] <gnarf> has nothing to do with Globalize
[05:39:30] <gnarf> :)
[05:39:31] <rworth> what's the issue?
[05:40:03] <gnarf> what should it be.... I can see why you might want to be able to get/set in a format other than formatted string
[05:40:11] <gnarf> perferably some integer representing the time
[05:41:10] <gnarf> should it take/make a Date object?  Use GMT time - system time? etc
[05:41:49] <rworth> Globalize.parseDate returns a Date object
[05:42:45] <rworth> is the rest of your question regarding the timezone?
[05:42:58] <gnarf> yup
[05:43:04] <rworth> that's a fun one
[05:44:27] <mwk_> anyone in here know of a good ui design / webapp development shop in the uk?
[05:44:41] <mwk_> recommendations appreciated :-)
[05:46:54] <gnarf> rworth: if Globalize isn't loaded....
[05:47:21] <gnarf> rworth: i assume i can just use new Date( 1970, 0, 1, hrs, mins, sec )
[05:47:34] <gnarf> i'm just curious if I should use the "local" time or GMT
[05:47:38] <gnarf> mwk_: This is a channel for talking about developing jQuery UI - not shopping.  Try #jquery / #html5 etc?
[05:48:22] <gnarf> and mornin scott_gonzalez
[05:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> hey gnarf
[05:49:19] <gnarf> seems Globalize uses "local" time
[05:49:29] <rworth> gnarf: I think I understand your question now, how to represent a time without a date?
[05:49:53] <gnarf> rworth: basically...
[05:51:00] <rworth> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/common-microsyntaxes.html#times
[05:51:40] <rworth> I don't think it makes sense to involve dates and timezones if all you're representing is time
[05:52:48] <mwk_> gnarf: apologies -- i was just looking for some recommendations from the kind of people I trust
[05:53:11] <rworth> gnarf: see also http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#time-state
[05:53:13] <gnarf> so the "raw value" would be "01:30:50" - always in 24 hr format?
[05:53:49] <rworth> yeah, I think that makes sense
[05:54:31] <gnarf> "return the number of milliseconds elapsed from midnight to the parsed time on a day with no time changes"
[05:54:54] <mwk_> it is easy to find web design shops.  it is easy to find coders.  it is practically impossible to find a decent shop/someone that can do both
[05:54:57] <rworth> oh, and you were right about converting it to a date, see last link "The algorithm to convert a string to a Date object, given a string input, is as follows: If parsing a time from input results in an error, then return an error; otherwise, return a Date object representing the parsed time in UTC on 1970-01-01."
[05:55:24] <gnarf> rworth: but i don't think thats actually exposed anywhere from a time input
[05:55:44] <gnarf> but I think using the standard of "ms from 00:00:00" might work
[05:55:48] <gnarf> skipping the date object
[05:56:13] <gnarf> so "12:00:00" would be 12 * 3600000
[05:57:25] <rworth> yeah, that seems reasonable too, but why a number and not a string? because the string can be added to a date and put in an input
[05:58:02] <rworth> the number is only useful to a computer, the string can be used by computer or human
[05:58:25] * gnarf nods
[05:59:05] <gnarf> I'm just trying to think of the most useful return from .timepicker( "value" )
[05:59:20] <gnarf> string requires parsing if you plan on doing something with it
[05:59:29] <gnarf> other than appending to another string
[05:59:38] <rworth> and number requires conversion if you plan on doing something with it
[05:59:42] <gnarf> yeah
[05:59:56] * gnarf shrugs
[06:00:01] <gnarf> debate up in the air
[06:00:10] <gnarf> I can implement both
[06:00:25] <rworth> nah
[06:00:28] <gnarf> "value" for a string, "numericValue" for a number
[06:00:44] <rworth> there's no need to do 1 of many possible conversions for the user
[06:01:09] <gnarf> well we are already converting to/from the value in .val()
[06:01:12] <rworth> if they want it as a date, we tell them what we're giving them and they figure it out, same thing with number or whatever
[06:01:27] <rworth> converting to/from what?
[06:01:38] <gnarf> currently, nothing
[06:02:28] <gnarf> one of the reasons i thought that a UTC Date() object might make the most sense
[06:02:49] <rworth> if user's didn't need this widget and just typed in a string and that string got sent to the server and back to the user without modification and the user could modify that same string, that would be "01:30:50"
[06:02:54] <gnarf> you could easily get the time out of it via getUTCHours / etc; or drop it to a string
[06:03:11] <rworth> so I don't see any reason to represent it differently than that
[06:03:18] <gnarf> fair enough
[06:03:48] <gnarf> "value" method will return a forced 24hr / seconds string - always
[06:04:08] <rworth> a valid time as defined by html5 spec
[06:04:42] <gnarf> and perhaps allow "setting" from 24hr/seconds - number meaning MS from 00:00:00 - or a Date object (non-UTC)
[06:04:54] <gnarf> if we care to support those other params at all
[06:05:02] <rworth> sure, set with anything we could possibly deal with
[06:05:22] <rworth> but we don't need to provide multiple format getters if we document the type of our one getter
[06:05:28] <rworth> and they can take it from there
[06:05:32] <gnarf> agree
[06:26:03] <gnarf> hoping to have my slides done today
[06:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> jeez, this autocomplete ticket is crazy
[06:43:29] <gnarf> crazy strange, or crazy outlandish?
[06:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> the guy is just crazy confusing about what he wants changed
[06:44:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: which ticket?
[06:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> I *think* I've finally figured out what he wants
[06:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7736
[06:46:55] <gnarf> yeah?
[06:47:01] <gnarf> more power too ya
[06:47:05] <gnarf> i got no clue what he wants
[06:47:06] <gnarf> :)
[06:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> I think he just wants the default behavior of mouse focusing to do nothing
[06:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> as opposed to changing it back to the original text
[06:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> but I'm not sure since he keeps going back and forth about seemingly unrelated stuff
[06:48:21] <gnarf> I don't think he wants us to change it in the lib either, i think he just wants to know how he can implement it in his code
[06:49:00] <gnarf> ahhh
[06:49:04] <gnarf> i think i see what you mean
[06:49:12] <gnarf> and thats really not "focus" - "hover" perhaps
[06:49:32] <gnarf> but that if you up/down arrow to an item, when you move your mouse across the list it reverts to what you typed
[06:50:18] <gnarf> instead of staying with the last "selected" answer from the mouse events
[06:50:29] <gnarf> er key events
[06:50:36] <gnarf> brb
[06:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, you can stop that by canceling the default action of focus
[06:56:11] <gnarf> so "focus": function ( e ) { /mouse/.test(e.originalEvent.type) && e.preventDefault() }
[06:56:11] <gnarf> ?
[06:56:26] <gnarf> does what he wants?
[06:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> it's supposed to, but I'm testing it right now and it doesn't seem to
[06:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> ah, that's why he references the blur event
[06:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> the blur event returns the value back to the original
[07:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, we might want to just remove the blur handler completely
[07:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> hah, all tests pass if I remove the blur event handler
[07:04:56] <kborchers> nice
[08:20:38] <gnarf> oh btw guys, http://xkcd.com/956/
[08:22:00] <kborchers> heh, this one is still my favorite http://xkcd.com/754/
[08:23:14] <gnarf> http://xkcd.com/583/
[08:24:13] <kborchers> gnarf: that one seems a little more relevant ... and funnier ;)
[08:24:31] <gnarf> i totally just grabbed the wrong link out of the paste

[10:14:31] <ajpiano> does anyone else know
[10:14:39] <ajpiano> if resetting passwords is known to be busted
[10:14:43] <ajpiano> on trac?
[10:15:18] <rpflo> Did callSuper and applySuper get added .widget? I remember seeing a commit a while back about it
[10:15:33] <gnarf> rpflo: _super
[10:15:49] <gnarf> rpflo: only in the 1.9 stuff though
[10:15:58] <rpflo> oh, not current release, okay
[10:15:58] <gnarf> ajpiano: no, but i could try to reset my password
[10:16:09] <gnarf> i might be wrong
[10:16:10] <gnarf> lemme check
[10:16:12] <rpflo> Just brushing up my talk for saturday
[10:16:29] <gnarf> talk about the milestone, maybe it will make someone actually use it
[10:16:31] <gnarf> :)
[10:17:22] <rpflo> gnarf: I just switched jobs and haven't been doing much ui development for a bit, what's "the milestone" ?
[10:17:38] <gnarf> 1.9 milestone 6
[10:18:14] <gnarf> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/09/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-6-spinner-2/
[10:18:34] <gnarf> that would have "new widget factory" stuff
[10:18:36] <gnarf> like _super
[10:19:33] <gnarf> yeah, nothing _super related in the 1.8 branch
[10:19:59] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L65-85
[10:20:04] <rpflo> Cool, I may take 5 minutes to talk about the milestone
[10:20:19] <gnarf> um, _bind is new too
[10:20:36] <gnarf> binds events in the context of the widget instance
[10:20:44] <gnarf> with support for delegate selectors too
[10:21:41] <gnarf> rpflo: whats the topic btw?
[10:21:45] <rpflo> awesome, I was complaining about not having widget instance events
[10:21:58] <rpflo> gnarf: jQuery's secret weapon: .widget
[10:22:58] <gnarf> rpflo: you might want to look over some of the methods in git
[10:23:06] <gnarf> theres some cool ones
[10:26:00] <rpflo> gnarf: new 1.9 methods? or just widget methods generally?
[10:26:20] <gnarf> like _bind, _delay
[10:27:06] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[10:27:25] <gnarf> hrm
[10:27:30] <gnarf> that doesn't have the new ones
[10:29:17] <gnarf> grr
[10:29:25] <gnarf> does auto-login work on the wiki for anyone else?
[10:37:53] <gnarf> _bind(), _delay(), _focusable(), _hoverable()
[10:38:19] <gnarf> rpflo: i think thats the new stuff that isn't in the wiki, not sure how much of that should be documented
[10:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: all the docs are being written from scratch
[10:39:27] <rpflo> Finding documentation on .widget is hard.  I learned it by reading the source.  I've only got 30 mins, so I think I'll just stick with the basics of the latest release.
[10:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> http://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs/
[10:40:08] <rpflo> nice.  Actually, scott_gonzalez, if you have anything you think I should mention, link to, talk about, let me know.
[10:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: I want to talk about events with you and the team at the conf
[10:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need to change to plugin:event
[10:40:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: have you looked at 1.7 events?
[10:40:44] <rpflo> I'll be talking about creating a widget, extending an existing widget, events, options, init, create, etc.
[10:40:50] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: that'd be awesome
[10:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: no
[10:41:06] <rpflo> slideshowshowcomplete makes me cry
[10:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> slideshow:showcomplete doesn't?
[10:41:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L974-1007
[10:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> if a single character stops the tears, I'm all for it :-)
[10:42:15] <rpflo> nope, I can read it, and it would be slideshow:complete, so yeah, I guess slideshowcomplete is what still gives me the sniffles.
[10:43:49] <scott_gonzalez> oh, support for .click( false ) ?
[10:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> cool, well I think we need it, especially for plugins where we currently collapse event names
[10:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> like resizable changing its prefix to resize and then collapsing resizeresize -> resize
[10:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> we're running into conflicts with native events :-(
[10:45:58] <gnarf> i like the colon more
[10:46:37] <gnarf> draggable:start ?
[10:47:17] <rpflo> We've been using the colon in MooTools for a similar use case, and I think it works well.
[10:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: simulate() should be exposed
[10:49:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: DaveMetvin's work i believe
[10:50:30] <gnarf> but i kinda agree
[10:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> I would guess >90% of custom special events contain similar logic

[11:34:25] <kborchers>  ?tell ajpiano thanks for that and I should be around until about 4:30 CST if you still need to chat about something
[11:34:46] <kborchers> c'mon bot-t1
[14:11:20] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: hey
[14:11:44] <Dave_Stein> i dont know how you miss PMs -they are supposed to be more direct. then again a bunch of IRC people said that and i still dont understand
[14:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> Colloquy is less in-my-face about PMs than mentions
[14:16:43] <Dave_Stein> ahh
[14:16:48] <Dave_Stein> i use XChat cause it was the first one i found
[14:16:57] <Dave_Stein> what time zone are you in btw?
[14:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> Eastern
[14:17:31] <Dave_Stein> oh thats easy me too. im in ny with ajpiano :)
[14:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano and I went to the same high school
[14:17:56] <Dave_Stein> thats funny
[14:18:13] <Dave_Stein> me and him are on words with friends now
[14:18:17] <Dave_Stein> but high school trumps that ha
[14:18:42] <Dave_Stein> i should be good to work on jquery sometime around 8 with ya. i did get linked to some getting started places from guys but not sure if you want anything special
[14:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> I can probably do 8:30p
[14:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be putting my kids to bed at 8:00
[14:20:49] <Dave_Stein> ok cool

[14:24:18] <gnarf> something with AM/PM that wasn't english
[14:26:29] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[14:26:37] <gnarf> those 3 cultures aren't very interesting
[15:18:57] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] fnagel pushed 8 new commits to selectmenu: http://git.io/oxVYgw

[17:22:49] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez save me from coding APIs
[17:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> what do you have so far?
[17:23:55] <Dave_Stein> i got dragging working in all positions that i can tell along with scrolling and clone being a boolean option
[17:24:10] <Dave_Stein> was holding off on doing more until i got that much onto git
[17:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> is it on git now?
[17:24:56] <Dave_Stein> no i just have a git account
[17:25:09] <Dave_Stein> and a client somewhere over here to do command line shit that id have to look up
[17:26:22] <Dave_Stein> should i just go to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui, hit fork, and see what happens?
[17:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[17:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> did you setup your account competely?
[17:27:08] <Dave_Stein> okay i hit fork, it did stuff , but now im back at where i was before
[17:27:14] <Dave_Stein> yeah i did that like am onth or so ago
[17:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> did you add your public key and all that stuff?
[17:27:19] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[17:27:30] <Dave_Stein> i set it up - just gotta figure out how to login for that stuff again
[17:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> you're actually not where you were before :-P
[17:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> you're now at your fork
[17:27:52] <Dave_Stein> the UI and the URL look the same as before
[17:27:54] <Dave_Stein> oh oh
[17:27:56] <Dave_Stein> davestein/jquery-ui
[17:27:57] <Dave_Stein> haha
[17:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:28:07] <Dave_Stein> programmers are not designers :)
[17:28:27] <Dave_Stein> ah okay so i just opened up git-bash cause im assuming i need to do something there now
[17:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> cd to whatever directory you keep your projects in
[17:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> then: git clone git@github.com:DaveStein/jquery-ui.git
[17:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> that will get you a full copy of your fork on your local machine
[17:30:23] <Dave_Stein> k... im in the process of remembering/searching where i put the last git thing i did which was one file
[17:30:31] <Dave_Stein> im sure this soudns sad haha
[17:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> well, you can run the clone command from anywhere
[17:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> it will generate a jquery-ui directory inside whatever directory you're in when you run the command
[17:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> you can move the directory later if you want, git won't get mad
[17:31:29] <Dave_Stein> ah found it
[17:31:35] <Dave_Stein> when i get into git bash it just defaults to /users/Dave
[17:31:37] <Dave_Stein> its fine to go there
[17:32:36] <Dave_Stein> ugh great job me- i ahve to remember my passphrase
[17:32:41] <Dave_Stein> *sigh*
[17:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> you shouldn't have to enter passwords to use GitHub
[17:33:09] <scott_gonzalez> it should authenticate with SSH keys
[17:33:47] <Dave_Stein> hmm
[17:33:53] <Dave_Stein> its asking for passphrase for key Dave/.ssh/id_rsa
[17:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[17:34:13] <Dave_Stein> and that folder has all sorts of encrypted goodness possibly from when i set it up
[17:34:41] <Dave_Stein> well its weird that its going to id_rsa cause i haev id_rsa.pub with the public key i made in github
[17:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> id_rsa is your private key
[17:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub has your public key
[17:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> together they do magical encryption stuff
[17:36:26] <Dave_Stein> oh wait i think i was being real dumb
[17:36:49] <Dave_Stein> am i supposed to really use git@github.com ?
[17:36:54] <Dave_Stein> or was that fillter for my account?
[17:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> that should be filler for your account
[17:40:04] <Dave_Stein> i switched it for my accounts email address
[17:40:10] <Dave_Stein> and its askign for my password instead of passphrase
[17:40:20] <Dave_Stein> i enter the password iu se on the site and its unhappy
[17:40:55] <Dave_Stein> git clone dave@behance.com:DaveStein/jquery-ui.git
[17:41:56] <Dave_Stein> you know what F this, i can edit the file on the site
[17:42:00] <Dave_Stein> and worry about my client later
[17:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> you can't branch on the site
[17:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> and you need to branch
[17:42:36] <Dave_Stein> oh i need to branch after fork?
[17:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's start this way...
[17:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> go to gist.github.com
[17:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> just dump your code into a gist for now
[17:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> note the "Add another file..." link below the big text area
[17:44:01] <Dave_Stein> ya
[17:44:24] <Dave_Stein> you want me to add my ui draggable core and widget?
[17:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> anything that you changed or created
[17:44:59] <Dave_Stein> well i only changed that one file
[17:45:37] <Dave_Stein> https://gist.github.com/1246690
[17:45:50] <Dave_Stein> im probably just gonna reset my account on git in some way
[17:45:55] <Dave_Stein> i know when i set it up the first time i had no issue
[17:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:47:34] <Dave_Stein> oh boi you gave me wrong direction by mistake i think
[17:47:43] <Dave_Stein> git clone git://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui.git was good enough
[17:47:44] <Dave_Stein> its doing stuff now
[17:47:47] <Dave_Stein> without the username in front
[17:47:57] <Dave_Stein> yup
[17:47:58] <Dave_Stein> it worked perfect
[17:47:59] <Dave_Stein> lol
[17:48:05] <Dave_Stein> http://gitref.org/creating/#clone
[17:48:32] <Dave_Stein> okay so lets start over, i have repository on my machine
[17:49:43] <Dave_Stein> so now cd jquery-ui and then git branch {name} what name do we want
[17:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> interactions
[17:51:57] <Dave_Stein> sorry if i just made you hate the world a bit more
[17:52:00] <Dave_Stein> branching now
[17:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> then `git checkout interactions`
[17:52:22] <Dave_Stein> done
[17:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> then replace jquery.ui.draggable.js with your new code
[17:52:49] <Dave_Stein> done
[17:53:02] <Dave_Stein> then git commit -m ''
[17:53:14] <Dave_Stein> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/25941597/Commit%20Message%20Style%20Guide with that style
[17:53:38] <Dave_Stein> righto?
[17:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> it's gonna be something like "Draggable: Initial commit for new implementation."
[17:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> btw, there's a lot wrong with your code in terms of coding standards
[17:55:19] <Dave_Stein> ill have to take another swing at that doc then
[17:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> anyway, after you commit, you need to push your changes up to GitHub
[17:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> git push origin interactions
[17:56:00] <Dave_Stein> yeah i gotta stage first
[17:56:01] <Dave_Stein> >.>
[17:56:02] <Dave_Stein> apparently
[17:56:07] <Dave_Stein> im used to SVN
[17:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> git add ui/jquery.u.draggable.js
[17:57:02] <Dave_Stein> yeah i just added
[17:57:11] <Dave_Stein> and now son of a bitch
[17:57:23] <Dave_Stein> NOW its telling me i need to use git@github.com:DaveStein to push
[17:57:27] <Dave_Stein> so close
[18:02:48] <Dave_Stein> okay im gonna reset as planned before >.>
[18:11:12] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez and got it
[18:11:24] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez i just had to ya know resetup my entire rsa key and enter a new passphrase but i got it
[18:11:40] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez ended up using git@github.com and entering my passphrase
[18:12:15] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/branches/interactions
[18:13:57] <Dave_Stein> are your tabs 2 or 4 spaces? coding doc looks like 2
[18:14:12] <Dave_Stein> i see my // comments should be above
[18:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> they're tabs
[18:14:43] <Dave_Stein> too used to using override in Notepad++ i can fix that
[18:14:44] <Dave_Stein> along with //
[18:14:58] <Dave_Stein> i still dont know why i couldnt remember my passphrase earlier, i have like 3 passwords to choose from
[18:15:21] <Dave_Stein> i've used single quotes a few times by mistake
[18:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> also camelCase
[18:15:47] <Dave_Stein> use or dont use?
[18:15:50] <Dave_Stein> i dont see anything about it here
[18:15:50] <Dave_Stein> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[18:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> use
[18:16:16] <Dave_Stein> ah for variable names right
[18:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> don't use snake_case
[18:16:25] <Dave_Stein> so dragEl instead of drag_el
[18:16:28] <Dave_Stein> got it
[18:16:56] <Dave_Stein> good thing i can regex replace that one out at least
[18:19:43] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonazlez: does _start_coords become startCoords or _startCoords
[18:20:36] <Dave_Stein> i guess startCoords dont see anything like that in toher files
[18:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> properties don't need to start with _
[18:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> only private methods need the prefix
[18:21:47] <Dave_Stein> k k
[18:21:52] <Dave_Stein> so while im fixing the style
[18:22:00] <Dave_Stein> did you check it out at all functionality-wise?
[18:22:27] <Dave_Stein> is it bad i comment at the end of functions the way i do?
[18:22:55] <Dave_Stein> i hate looking at the bottom of a curly brace and not knowing what it's attached to but i dont see that anywhere.....
[18:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that will go away
[18:23:34] <Dave_Stein> okay gettin rid of em
[18:27:37] <Dave_Stein> oh so much space with actual tabs
[18:27:41] <Dave_Stein> :)
[18:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[18:27:59] <Dave_Stein> its real weird switching between coding standards
[18:28:06] <Dave_Stein> but i can always change them here to match jquery
[18:28:11] <Dave_Stein> im sure aside from the tabbing thign at least
[18:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> indeed, it's annoying that there isn't a single standard
[18:28:53] <Dave_Stein> that would be too easy
[18:29:42] <Dave_Stein> almost comitted without changing a snake case
[18:30:58] <Dave_Stein> gasp i foudn an unused var
[18:34:01] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/commit/cb828a52bd814c540cc7dece45b5066c1191c23d
[18:34:21] <Dave_Stein> ah shit destroy is missing a tab but ill get that in next commit
[18:34:29] <Dave_Stein> destroy doesnt even destroy yet - i put a todo
[18:34:42] <Dave_Stein> which is funny considering its like the file needs TODO: everything ever :)
[18:35:31] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/blob/cb828a52bd814c540cc7dece45b5066c1191c23d/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js
[18:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to test out a bunch of scenarios on it tomorrow
[18:38:35] <Dave_Stein> okay awesome
[18:38:39] <Dave_Stein> sorry i was such a pain tonight
[18:39:00] <Dave_Stein> but now i have a goal to get so amazing on the jquery team that you guys start to add comments of function names at end of function :)
[18:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> good luck with that :-P
[18:39:54] <Dave_Stein> its so useful when im scrolling down the file
[18:39:55] <Dave_Stein> haha
[18:40:13] <Dave_Stein> anyway now that it matches style, does it at least *look* okay before testing
[18:40:35] <Dave_Stein> this is literally the first open source thing im ever doing, if you couldnt tell haha
[18:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> there are still some style issues
[18:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> like you align colons and equal signs
[18:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> colons should always be flush against the properly name
[18:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> some stuff is too spread out
[18:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> like https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/blob/cb828a52bd814c540cc7dece45b5066c1191c23d/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L196
[18:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> you can't define objects as properties in the prototype like https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/blob/cb828a52bd814c540cc7dece45b5066c1191c23d/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L29
[18:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> because the objects will be shared across all instnances
[18:47:03] <Dave_Stein> sorry i hopped away, build issue
[18:47:24] <Dave_Stein> good point about the shared, ill fix that up with two draggables on one screen
[18:47:39] <Dave_Stein> where should it live then? i can only think of options but that doesn't make sense
[18:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> you can define them in _create()
[18:48:38] <Dave_Stein> so this.dragEl = {} is safe there
[18:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> or if they just get written, as opposed to extended, then you don't need to define them upfront
[18:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:50:06] <Dave_Stein> that long etra space was mistake when converting double space to real tab
[18:50:14] <Dave_Stein> but no lining up equal signs huh?
[18:50:21] <Dave_Stein> who made that rule?! :)
[18:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> do you write PHP during the day?
[18:51:44] <Dave_Stein> yeah i wrote both
[18:51:57] <Dave_Stein> do PHP people line up and JS people don't?
[18:52:17] <Dave_Stein> the _ makes sense being removed since we're saving bytes there but spacing gets cut out in minification
[18:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> it's a pain to maintain
[18:52:53] <Dave_Stein> column select :)
[18:53:54] <Dave_Stein> well when i get some time again ill fix the multiple instances issue and the spacing
[18:53:58] <Dave_Stein> see what else you can find wrong
[18:54:16] <Dave_Stein> btw i realized that you said true/false for helper... are we gonna put back the option of sending a function?
[18:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> just want to start small and get a solid foundation
[18:55:15] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[18:55:35] <Dave_Stein> well saturday i should have time to fix anything you point out
[18:55:57] <Dave_Stein> how do you wanna send feedback?
[18:56:12] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: did you ever get git working?
[18:56:55] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: yeah i had to friggin delete my .ssh files and start fresh - i musta made a dumb mistake with my passphrase originally
[18:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send you a pull request :-P
[18:57:46] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: but just running through regenerating and keys got me set faster than trying to figure what was wrong before
[18:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> oh crap, I can't do that
[18:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> stupid GitHub
[18:57:56] <Dave_Stein> lol
[18:58:00] <Dave_Stein> can i give you permission somehow?
[18:58:05] <Dave_Stein> im guessing you cant cause i made branch?
[18:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> no, you can't have multiple forks of the same project
[18:58:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you don't need multiple forks
[18:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> you can send a pull request to someone other than the original creator?
[18:58:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you should be able to send pull vs his branch
[18:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[18:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> let's test that out right now
[18:59:32] <Dave_Stein> #overmyhead ha
[18:59:57] <Dave_Stein> im guessing i shuold get a notification from you?
[18:59:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: when you do the pull request
[19:00:09] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/430a0C1f3A2F0l3U0k2U
[19:00:21] <gnarf> those drop downs let you select from the forks
[19:00:34] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: whats yer github?
[19:00:40] <Dave_Stein> DaveStein
[19:00:55] <Dave_Stein> im amazed i didn't need an underscore for once
[19:01:03] <gnarf> hrm for some reason i don't see it in the fork list
[19:01:17] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui
[19:01:23] <Dave_Stein> says its forked from right place
[19:02:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if you go to https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/compare/mask...DaveStein:master
[19:02:16] <gnarf> but of course, switch gnarf37 for yourself
[19:02:19] <gnarf> and the proper branch names
[19:02:23] <gnarf> and file a pull from there
[19:02:25] <gnarf> it will base right
[19:02:46] <gnarf> and actually - gotta switch the order
[19:02:59] <gnarf> its compare/pulltarget...pullfrom
[19:03:32] <Dave_Stein> brb more buid issues
[19:03:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: found the url format: https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/new/DaveStein:master...jquery:mask
[19:04:10] <gnarf> You're asking  DaveStein to pull 58 commits into DaveStein:master from jquery:mask
[19:04:30] <Dave_Stein> that's not a lot at all! ha
[19:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...he's not showing up in the list for me
[19:04:53] <Dave_Stein> github error? log out and then back in? :)
[19:06:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: don't use the list
[19:06:11] <gnarf> just use that url ^^^
[19:06:22] <gnarf> just fill in the right branches
[19:06:38] <gnarf> left side of the ... is where you want the pull to land, and right side is what you want pulled
[19:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/compare/interactions...DaveStein:interactions
[19:07:12] <gnarf> whats the new pull request button do from there?
[19:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[19:07:25] <gnarf> oh yeah, reverse the order there
[19:07:32] <gnarf> left is "base" right is "on top"
[19:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> there is no pull request button on that page
[19:08:15] <gnarf>  https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/new/DaveStein:interactions...scottgonzalez:interactions
[19:08:19] <gnarf> how about that?
[19:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that works
[19:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> why can't GitHub just build shit that works
[19:08:50] <gnarf> yeah - i think that dropdown is just a cached thing
[19:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> PR sent
[19:08:58] <gnarf> itll prolly have him in like an hour or something
[19:09:04] <Dave_Stein> haha
[19:09:11] <Dave_Stein> that statement is horrible coming from a coder Scott
[19:09:15] <Dave_Stein> replace GitHub with jQuery
[19:09:17] <Dave_Stein> ;)
[19:09:25] <Dave_Stein> god damn these interaction bugs!
[19:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> I hear it all the time :-)
[19:09:43] <Dave_Stein> are you still in nyc btw?
[19:09:52] <gnarf> you scott_gonzalez, the description of your pull is wrong
[19:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> seriously though, GitHub has a ton of features that are totally hidden
[19:09:57] <gnarf> it shoulda been "FIRST!" ;)
[19:10:15] <gnarf> Dave_Stein:  https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/pull/1
[19:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> nope, haven't lived in NY since 2000
[19:10:23] <gnarf> you should have a "merge" button there
[19:10:34] <Dave_Stein> okay i see the pull request
[19:10:36] <Dave_Stein> where you added one space
[19:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, just testing it out :-)
[19:11:12] <Dave_Stein> okay so how do i accept it
[19:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: would've been nice to know about that when I was working with Wes on the QUnit changes that apparently killed core
[19:11:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :)
[19:11:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did you guys track that down?
[19:11:38] <gnarf> I just tracked it to wes' commit
[19:11:51] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: on the pull discussion
[19:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't looked at it at all
[19:11:54] <gnarf> there should be a merge button
[19:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just heard about it in passing
[19:11:59] <Dave_Stein> ah yes
[19:12:02] <Dave_Stein> i had clicked into commit
[19:12:02] <gnarf> that will let you merge it in automatically
[19:12:03] <Dave_Stein> and it wasnt tehre
[19:12:05] <Dave_Stein> merge pull request
[19:12:10] <gnarf> then
[19:12:22] <Dave_Stein> Draggable: Whitespace fix
[19:12:22] <gnarf> git pull on your local copy to update from "origin"
[19:12:44] <Dave_Stein> done
[19:12:51] <gnarf> and you should now have scotts commit on your HEAD
[19:12:59] <gnarf> git status / git log should reflect that
[19:13:15] <wwalser> hi gnarf I haven't looked at the QUnit stuff yet
[19:13:47] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: my file system didnt update
[19:14:01] <wwalser> I've been out late every night this week and we just shipped a new version so I haven't gotten any 20% time either. I'll take a look at it soon.
[19:14:12] <Dave_Stein> oh oops
[19:14:13] <Dave_Stein> nm
[19:14:14] <wwalser> thanks for taking the time to track it to me though
[19:14:15] <Dave_Stein> gotta write branch
[19:14:17] <gnarf> wwalser: ping me if you do - I'll be happy to help if I can - although I'm heading to bed soon and should be flying tomorrow
[19:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> wwalser: tell the core team they need to fix their test suite in TestSwarm before you'll fix QUnit :-P
[19:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: tomorrow? isn't that a bit early?
[19:15:01] <wwalser> scott_gonzalez: is it broken enough to impact my ability to track down the problem?
[19:15:09] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: actually im lost - i wrote git pull jquery-ui and it says it not a git repo
[19:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> no, it's only broken in TestSwarm, apparently runs fine locally
[19:15:22] <wwalser> :\
[19:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's unrelated to the bug your'e tracking down
[19:15:31] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: git pull origin interactions
[19:15:43] <wwalser> oh, does mine fail locally gnarf ?
[19:15:44] <gnarf> you are pulling your "origin" === your github's "interactions" branch
[19:15:48] <gnarf> wwalser: yes
[19:15:50] <Dave_Stein> ah thanks
[19:15:52] <wwalser> awesome, thanks
[19:15:52] <gnarf> wwalser: its tricky though
[19:15:54] <Dave_Stein> yay a new space
[19:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> wwalser: their tests are all kinds of busted: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/104/
[19:16:07] <gnarf> wwalser: it doesn't fail "directly' but somehow tests aren't cleaning up or something
[19:16:30] <gnarf> all the fails are stuff like "doesn't empty cache" or "timers not left around"
[19:16:39] <wwalser> I've walked through tricky in qunit plenty of times https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/148
[19:16:47] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: so dragEl, position, etc will all go into _create
[19:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:17:06] <wwalser> scott_gonzalez: that swarm graph is scary
[19:17:14] <wwalser> I didn't do that!
[19:17:34] <Dave_Stein> i have to download all this crap at home again later
[19:17:36] <Dave_Stein> noooooo
[19:17:48] <Dave_Stein> and i have a god damn gravatar but it didnt update on git
[19:17:57] <Dave_Stein> screw this open source *leaves forever* lol
[19:18:42] <wwalser> git is a bit of a trip at first, but you'll get it down pretty quickly
[19:19:46] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[19:20:34] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: so you want to do pull requests for simple changes, but when that base file is ready for new options how are we deciding who does which?
[19:20:52] <Dave_Stein> when is that weekly dev IRC meeting again?
[19:20:57] <Dave_Stein> i know ive seen it listed somewhere
[19:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> Wednesdays at noon
[19:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> it's in the topic
[19:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> I bet there's some clever IRC trick for getting the topic to display in the chat
[19:21:41] <gnarf> which i may or may not be ad
[19:21:45] <gnarf> its before my flight
[19:21:45] <Dave_Stein> lol
[19:21:53] <gnarf> so i might be sitting in the airport @ the meeting
[19:21:55] <Dave_Stein> you mean looking at the top of this window
[19:22:10] <Dave_Stein> my eyes filtered that top part out like an ad
[19:22:10] <Dave_Stein> haha
[19:22:11] <gnarf> and yeah scott_gonzalez - flying in a little early and staying a little late
[19:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> well, you have to wait two full days for food + fun
[19:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> and run&coke™
[19:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: how awesome is run&coke™?
[19:23:50] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Cannot predict now.
[19:24:07] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: so the answer to my prior question is, in fact, the weekly meetings?
[19:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> or IRC or planning wiki
[19:24:36] <Dave_Stein> k k
[19:25:17] <gnarf> ?topic
[19:25:18] <bot-t> Topic: jQuery UI development (support at #jquery, core dev at #jquery-dev) Overview: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/ - meeting at Wednesday, 12pm Eastern (9am Pacific, 6:00pm CEST), in #jquery-meeting - Agenda: http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda
[19:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf knows all the tricks...
[19:25:56] <Dave_Stein> yup
[19:26:00] <Dave_Stein> who programs that bot anywho
[19:26:04] <gnarf> temp01
[19:26:30] <Dave_Stein> btw do you guys know imsky, and is he crazy to everyone or does he really not like me? lol
[19:27:19] <wwalser> gnarf: you going to jsconf?
[19:27:30] <gnarf> wwalser: yes
[19:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> dont' know imsky
[19:27:36] <gnarf> wwalser: speaking actually
[19:27:42] <wwalser> nice, I have a co worker who is speaking as well
[19:27:47] <wwalser> he left two days ago I think
[19:28:00] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: i recognize the nick from #jquery - but nothing remarkable about him/her
[19:28:01] <wwalser> maybe yesterday
[19:28:08] <wwalser> I'm in AU so it's a 24hr flight I think
[19:28:17] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: jsconf is in oregon next?
[19:28:26] <gnarf> don't look at me - i'm new here
[19:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> wwalser: you mean jqcon, not jsconf, right?
[19:28:28] <gnarf> :)
[19:28:33] <gnarf> jqconf
[19:28:41] <wwalser> hrm...
[19:28:43] <wwalser> jsconf eu
[19:28:45] <wwalser> I think
[19:28:47] <wwalser> is what I mean
[19:28:55] <gnarf> i think jsconf eu and jqconf are same weekend
[19:29:06] <wwalser> right, my friend is going to jsconf eu
[19:29:06] <gnarf> so cunfuzzling
[19:29:11] <gnarf> i'm going to jqconf ;)
[19:29:15] <wwalser> so you probably won't see him ;)
[19:29:46] <Dave_Stein> what do you guys go over at jquery conf?
[19:29:52] <wwalser> scott_gonzalez: is michael still running RDUjs?
[19:30:01] <wwalser> I might try and do a talk in december when I come home
[19:30:01] <gnarf> http://events.jquery.com/schedule
[19:30:02] <Dave_Stein> is it like mostly getting new people into it, or going over where to take it next? 50/50 of those?
[19:30:13] <gnarf> http://events.jquery.org/2011/boston/schedule/
[19:30:13] <Dave_Stein> 404
[19:30:32] <gnarf> I'm talking about animate
[19:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> Michael never ran it, he runs TriPUG
[19:30:36] <Dave_Stein> i need to get on using jquery deferred instead of my own stupid thing
[19:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> Lucas runs trianglejs
[19:30:50] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: $.Deferred is hotness
[19:31:01] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: $.Callbacks is even cooler when you only want half a deferred :)
[19:32:17] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: i'm gonna take a closer look soon.. i hopped off my real cool app for an e-comm store this month so it can get done on time
[19:32:38] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: the cool app is why i need deferred and i havent even looked at $.Callbacks at all in comaprison to deferred so ill keep in mind
[19:33:09] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: alright, im gonna start bisecting from 1.8.4 then
[19:33:18] <Dave_Stein> i dont think jquery conf is for me though although i cant help but notice Spine.js looking just like Backbone.js - is that from same people or did someone else split that out?
[19:34:48] <Dave_Stein> i think this year i am actually going to jsconf us
[19:37:22] <Dave_Stein> and silence ensues
[19:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> heading to bed
[19:37:24] <Dave_Stein> anyway its home time for me
[19:37:39] <Dave_Stein> night guys
[19:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> night
