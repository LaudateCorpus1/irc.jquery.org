[01:15:26] <skdsuraj> I want to contribute to jquery ui under GSOC.
[01:15:36] <skdsuraj> Can anyone please guide me ?
[01:17:50] <arthurvr> Hey skdsuraj!
[01:18:40] <skdsuraj> Hi arthurvr :) 
[01:19:07] <arthurvr> First of all, you can read up on some stuff on contribute.jquery.org. It covers some of the base guidelines for contributing.
[01:19:30] <skdsuraj> Okay , I will read it.
[01:19:39] <arthurvr> Then, try to get involved with the project by, for example, sending a PR.
[01:19:53] <arthurvr> You can find the open tickets at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[01:20:20] <skdsuraj> Okay
[01:20:24] <arthurvr> What project specifically are you interested in?
[01:21:42] <arthurvr> The demo system, slider or interactions?
[01:27:11] <skdsuraj> Effects is also there , right ?
[01:32:14] <arthurvr> skdsuraj: Which one do you mean with ‚Äùeffects‚Äù? For jQuery UI we only have the new demo system, slider rewrite and interactions rewrite.

[01:33:10] <gsoc-interest> hello arthur..
[01:33:19] <arthurvr> Hi gsoc-interest!
[01:34:30] <gsoc-interest> Someone reported a issue in jquery-mobile but when i reviewed it then it comes out to be design problem of that guy only 
[01:34:52] <gsoc-interest> so how can i propose the coordinators to close that ticket
[01:36:19] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: Link? Sometimes it takes a while but a team member will come in and close it when that‚Äôs appropriate.

[01:38:05] <arthurvr> arschmitz: ^
[01:39:17] <skdsuraj> I am interested in the slider rewrite.
[01:40:21] <gsoc-interest> means i need to discuss it with alex..??
[01:40:22] <skdsuraj> So basically this slider widget needs to be re-written.
[01:41:25] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: Not really. He will see the notification once he‚Äôs around.
[01:41:54] <gsoc-interest> authurve: okay..Thanks :)
[01:42:53] <arthurvr> skdsuraj: The best person to talk about this is probably jzaefferer :)
[01:44:11] <skdsuraj> should I contact him directly ?
[01:44:14] <skdsuraj> Thanks a lot
[01:44:33] <arthurvr> skdsuraj: Not really. He will see the notification when he‚Äôs around.
[01:45:04] <arthurvr> skdsuraj: Stay in the channel for a while and he will be able to answer all questions you have.
[01:45:15] <skdsuraj> okay . So for now I will see the slider source code

[03:03:38] <skdsuraj> Hi arthurvr !
[03:03:45] <arthurvr> Hi skdsuraj!
[03:04:38] <skdsuraj> I am learning jquery from w3schools as I have prior working knowledge of css,html and js
[03:05:01] <skdsuraj> Also, I saw the api for slider
[03:06:01] <arthurvr> skdsuraj: Good to hear, but I wouldn‚Äôt say w3schools is the best place to get started with jQuery.. w3fools.com :-)
[03:06:02] <skdsuraj> what is the next course of action
[03:06:58] <skdsuraj> okay, so please tell me a better source to understand jquery properly !
[03:07:04] <arthurvr> learn.jquery.com :)
[03:07:16] <arthurvr> and api.jquery.com
[03:08:23] <skdsuraj> yup , i saw api.jquery.com
[03:09:41] <skdsuraj> Thanks for learn.jquery.com Its nice :)
[03:40:08] <mdhr> Hi, I'm interested in contributing to the slider rewrite project. Could somebody please help me get started?
