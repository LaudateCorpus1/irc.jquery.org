[01:49:41] <del3> hello?
[01:52:57] <IvanKuzev> can somebody help me with a css issue?
[02:00:23] <IvanKuzev> nevermind\
[07:01:09] <IvanKuzev> i need a little help planning my carousel plugin...please
[08:08:28] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #179: STILL FAILING in 1 min 34 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/179/
[08:08:29] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Build: Also minify i18n files.
[08:17:27] <gnarf> IvanKuzev: my first sense is that jQuery UI probably won't include a carosel, but considering the popularity of that type of plugin, we might be able to make an awesome one that stays up to date... Worst case scenario, you'll end up with a solid jQuery UI Plugin that you can release on your own
[08:33:21] <IvanKuzev> well they might include it ...someday. i hope atleast to get some feedback from the jquery ui comunity till then
[08:34:16] <gnarf> IvanKuzev: they = us
[08:34:18] <gnarf> :)
[08:34:56] <gnarf> I'm just sayin, it seems like something that will have a bit of resistance unless it absolutely rocks :)
[08:35:21] <gnarf> its hasData() related
[08:35:28] <gnarf> lemme get you caught up
[08:36:59] <IvanKuzev> what ...i didnt get the last 2 lines?
[08:37:31] <gnarf> wrong channel
[08:45:26] <IvanKuzev> ok.i think i got the options right this time. see http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137729/Carousel

[10:40:20] <kborchers> wow, just realized git was adding the wrong e-mail to all of my commits :( It is a valid e-mail, just not the one i wanted.

[11:11:20] <gnarf> sigh
[11:11:24] <gnarf> no more ivan in here
[12:08:43] <kborchers> looking for a little menu css help
[12:08:52] <kborchers> what can i change here https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/blob/65f5d9073db382970893e72525548627eb69491b/themes/base/jquery.ui.menu.css
[12:09:30] <kborchers> so that disabled menu items work at all menu levels (images coming)
[12:10:08] <kborchers> standard ul/li menu looks fine http://gyazo.com/c56285c1aa075419c24c90a55baacf2a
[12:10:57] <kborchers> but using divs for the menus and menu items with classes differentiating looks like this http://gyazo.com/1c2b14d3265b70bdcd5b649bcf736494
[12:11:04] <kborchers> but only in top level menu
[12:11:22] <kborchers> lower level menus show disabled items just fine http://gyazo.com/39ba348e40b23f5a20aac048d068dbc9
[12:17:41] <kborchers> i know images aren't the most helpful, if you pull my menubar_otherStructures branch, you can see it in action on the default menubar demo https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/tree/menubar_otherStructures
[13:10:37] <kborchers> nevermind ... i think i got it
[22:45:12] <ivankuzev> hello gnarf have a few minutes to spare?
