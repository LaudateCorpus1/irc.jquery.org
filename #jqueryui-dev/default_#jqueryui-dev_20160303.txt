[09:26:59] <Villain> Hi guys, just read your proposal for GSoC 2016 and fortunately found your 2 commits policy. So basically I wanted to ask what do expect to seen in those 2 commits?(from small typo fixes to core path fixes)
[11:16:24] <devsanjayjosh> Hello I'm new and I wish to contribute
[11:27:16] <devsanjayjosh> I am interested in contributing to jquery :updating touch gestures
[11:27:23] <devsanjayjosh> in hammer.js
[11:32:18] <arschmitz> Villain: which project are you refereeing to 
[11:32:28] <arschmitz> devsanjayjosh: great!
[11:36:51] <Villain> idk I was thinking jquery cause it has a big issues list. ;)
[11:37:17] <Villain> but still dunno what you really want to see
[11:38:35] <arschmitz> jquery it self did not have any projects on the GSoC list 
[11:39:30] <Villain> oh what a shame, sorry about this I didnt expect this. I ll into your proposal again
[11:39:44] <Villain> ll look*

[14:33:29] <sonali5> https://github.com/Sonali-Goyal/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/touch.js we need to convert all these methods to use hammer.js events right?

[14:53:17] <arschmitz> sonali5: yes
[14:53:57] <sonali5> So arschmitz what would ou like me to do as a part of proposal apart from solving the bug
[14:53:57] <sonali5> ?
[14:54:25] <arschmitz> find any bug in the issue tracker and fix it
[14:54:33] <arschmitz> oh sorry ou said apart from that
[14:55:02] <arschmitz> sonali5: so there are no strict requirments aside from the actual proposal and the bug
[14:55:11] <arschmitz> but the more you do and become involved
[14:55:19] <arschmitz> and show your knowledge and abilities the better
[14:55:26] <sonali5> yeah arschmitz
[14:55:39] <sonali5> i am just sending the pull request for the first bug
[14:55:46] <arschmitz> sonali5: great
[14:55:59] <arschmitz> and the more the stuff you do is related to the task the better
[14:56:07] <arschmitz> sonali5: since this related directly to hammer js as well
[14:56:13] <arschmitz> you could also fix a bug there
[14:56:25] <sonali5> Ok in hammer.js ?
[14:57:03] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:57:15] <arschmitz> its not required but since you will be using both it sure would not hurt
[14:57:20] <sonali5> arschmitz on dong commit is there any specific commit mesaage i need to write?
[14:57:33] <sonali5> sure arschmitz i would do that
[14:57:35] <arschmitz> yes we have guidelines
[14:57:37] <arschmitz> just a sec
[14:57:46] <arschmitz> http://contribute.jquery.org/
[14:57:54] <arschmitz> has lots of useful info for contributing
[14:58:05] <arschmitz> you will see a section on commits and pull requests
[15:37:05] <Villain> at "Prototype JavaScript transition module"  what exactly do you expect at the end? what's the difference with the existing jquery animate function?
