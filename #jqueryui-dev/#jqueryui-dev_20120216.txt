[11:05:48] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: i split browser map to another file. see infra wiki for details. send me your feedback.
[11:06:57] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: nice
[11:07:09] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez: so youre saying that will buy us some time when BS adds new clients?
[11:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[11:07:23] <jzaefferer> we want to get the useragents out of the testswarm db, dealing with those incremental IDs doesn't make sense
[11:07:26] <clarkbox> cool
[11:07:42] <jzaefferer> so once that is done, the mapping would be just from one name to another
[11:07:53] <clarkbox> yes
[11:09:03] <clarkbox> is the wiki all clear? any questions?
[11:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's clear.
[11:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to have a discussion with danheberden about this. I would think all of this needs to get out of a wiki and into actual code.
[11:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably have a repo of config for all services.
[11:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> But that's something to discuss with danheberden
[11:11:03] <danheberden> well, all services should be defined as puppet modules
[11:11:15] <clarkbox> pupet is whats planed
[11:11:22] <danheberden> aye
[11:12:05] <danheberden> and any retro documentation or instruction should be in the infra wiki, assuming it directly pertains to the setup of those services on servers
[11:12:15] <clarkbox> maybe we can have a infra hackathon at bay area conference?
[11:12:18] <danheberden> not anything specific to testing in general
[11:12:29] <danheberden> clarkbox we'll be done by then :p
[11:12:36] <clarkbox> ohhh damn
[11:12:38] <danheberden> i think we'll be up for writing configs monday
[11:12:38] <clarkbox> haha
[11:12:48] <danheberden> so you can hop in and start writing it all
[11:12:51] <danheberden> ALL OF IT
[11:12:57] <danheberden> :p
[11:13:00] <clarkbox> yes... ill be there ;)
[11:13:06] <danheberden> but seriously - there's a puppet and puppet-stage branch in the infra repo
[11:13:22] <clarkbox> nice. i didn't notice. ill check that out
[11:13:34] <danheberden> so by monday, i should have the puppet clients working properly with the puppet server
[11:14:03] <danheberden> my goal is puppet working, zabbix installed and ssh keys by monday
[11:14:08] <clarkbox> k, keep me in the loop, ill help out
[11:14:17] <danheberden> that should be a good proof of concept for it all, like, working 'n shit
[11:15:40] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer have a look at this if you want to know browserstack status - https://swarm.jquery.org:8000/en-US/app/search/browserstack
[11:16:01] <clarkbox> jzaefferer i think i need to make a user for you
[11:16:08] <clarkbox> danheberden you want to take a look
[11:16:16] <clarkbox> its a splunk "dashboard"
[11:16:42] <clarkbox> in the last 24 hrs, we have used 851 min on browserstack
[11:16:49] <clarkbox> !!
[11:17:09] <clarkbox> guess what browser took the most time
[11:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> "Splunk cannot find the "browserstack" view."
[11:19:01] <clarkbox> need to add perms
[11:19:04] <clarkbox> one sec
[11:19:38] <danheberden> clarkbox i think i only have perms on services.jquery.com
[11:19:44] <clarkbox> check now scott
[11:20:09] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: needs a new user?
[11:20:28] <clarkbox> danheberden what timezone are you in?
[11:20:38] <clarkbox> and you jzaefferer?
[11:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> Configuration error - we were not able to find a saved search called 'browserstack total time spent by browser'.
[11:20:42] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #256: STILL FAILING in 2 min 23 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/256/
[11:20:54] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: do I have an account?
[11:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, but I do see a total on the left.
[11:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> 950 mintues.
[11:21:01] <danheberden> clarkbox PST
[11:21:10] <clarkbox> adding you jzaefferer
[11:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Now 937. What's going on?
[11:21:18] <clarkbox> its running
[11:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> It went down.
[11:21:28] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez temporal shift
[11:21:33] <clarkbox> it is real time
[11:22:17] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez last 24 hours means it would drop down
[11:22:30] <danheberden> if not being used as much right now, ya know?
[11:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we have more than 24 hours of data already?
[11:22:46] <danheberden> this is pretty nifty clarkbox
[11:23:08] <danheberden> so splunk monitors the works on swarm that communicate with browserstack's services
[11:23:09] <danheberden> ?
[11:23:25] <danheberden> *workers
[11:24:11] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez http://danheberden.com/share/1d09faa.png
[11:24:16] <clarkbox> splunk monitors logs
[11:24:25] <clarkbox> you can search the logs
[11:24:33] <clarkbox> and at a very high level, make these dashboards
[11:24:54] <clarkbox> if you want to see the search language, click on "view results"
[11:26:59] <clarkbox> i only spent 10 min making this dashboard. ill add more shit to it, and track worker time over days
[11:27:13] <clarkbox> and maybe ill add some pie charts
[11:27:26] <jzaefferer> and ponies?
[11:27:33] <clarkbox> anything!
[11:28:12] <clarkbox> also, take these calculations with grain of salt. i need to tune things a little more to get it more accurate
[11:28:16] <clarkbox> but i think its pretty close

[13:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: is jquery-ui-git.js every 5 min?
[13:59:03] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ya, pretty sure
[13:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok, waiting... :-)
[14:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> 5 minutes feels like forever when you're waiting for it :-P
[14:02:32] <danheberden> twss
[14:02:46] <danheberden> so it *did* update?
[14:02:56] <danheberden> (fearful of yet another infra thing breaking :/ )
[14:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it's working
[14:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/ujuhiq/ :-)
[14:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/ujuhiq/2
[14:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers, gnarf, rworth, jzaefferer: ^^
[14:15:22] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez hawt
[14:15:48] <rworth> nice
[14:59:14] <clarkbox> very smooth scott_gonzalez
[16:07:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: its awesome how the new accordion animation is already a lot less code then before, and it still includes the BC
[16:07:43] <jzaefferer> also so nice to finally have that really working
[17:25:51] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/a9y_gA
[17:25:51] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Autocomplete: Removed the timeout for the change event. Fixes #7550 - Autocomplete change event not triggered in time. - Scott González
[17:30:55] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #258: STILL FAILING in 4 min 53 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/258/
[17:30:56] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Autocomplete: Removed the timeout for the change event. Fixes #7550 - Autocomplete change event not triggered in time.
[18:28:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that looks good!
[18:29:18] <kborchers> i just wish we didn't lose the bottom border but it's way better than a jump
[18:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, that's actually something that might get fixed in core.
[18:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> It happens because we're animating the border from 1px to 0px.
[18:32:25] <kborchers> i knew it!!!
[18:32:32] <kborchers> i could tell the border was the issue
[18:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> The browser is rounding that down to 0 the whole time, since it's always <1 during the animation.
[18:32:47] <kborchers> right
[18:33:00] <kborchers> that would be nice if it gets fixed in core!
[18:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> They might just force it to stay >= 1px during animation.
[18:35:39] <kborchers> cool, so it will still animate down to 1 and then just stay there until end and then 0 or just hidden?
[18:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> It'll animate down to 1, then at the end it'll hide and just go back to whatever it was before.
[18:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming you're using borderBottomWidth: "hide"
[18:37:12] <kborchers> nice
[18:38:38] <kborchers> now if i could just wrap my head around IE and its damn sync/async focus and blur events :/
[18:39:04] <kborchers> trying to get those tests that i commented out to work for menu
[18:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> focus/blur is so whacky in IE
[18:39:28] <kborchers> yep
[18:41:25] <kborchers> what's really weird is i get focus, menublur, focus when testing with clicking the menu then clicking off BUT...
[18:41:47] <kborchers> if i refresh i get focus, menublur, focus, menublur every time after that
[18:41:55] * kborchers jumps off a bridge
[18:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:42:22] <kborchers> and i only want focus, menublur
[18:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> log document.activeElement on doc ready
[18:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> See if you get different values on initial load and refresh
[18:52:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nope, body both time :(
[18:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:53:08] <kborchers> maybe it's just some weird browserstack thing
[18:53:39] <kborchers> i only get the 3 events when it's a fresh machine on browserstack
[18:54:02] <kborchers> if i leave the page and come back, i get 4 events on the first load
[18:54:56] <kborchers> it's still not what i want but it makes it even harder to test since they will probably be run on a fresh automated browserstack machine
[18:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to look into it tomorrow or early next week if you're still having problems.
[18:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> My brain is shutting down, so I'm gonna stop writing code.
[18:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want to know what will happen if I keep working right now, since I have no tests :-P
[18:56:50] <kborchers> heh
[18:57:02] <kborchers> ok, hoping to beat the crap out of it tonight but i'll let you know if i can't get it
[18:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even have a script to manually test.
[18:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just writing code and hoping it's gonna work in the end :-P
[18:57:40] <kborchers> hah, git push --pray
[18:57:45] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[18:58:56] <kborchers> man, my mac is setting my leg on fire right now ... don't have that much running
