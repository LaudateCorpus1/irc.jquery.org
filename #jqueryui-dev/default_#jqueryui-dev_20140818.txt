[04:33:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:36:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong
[04:36:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:37:11] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7612 and the scrolling seems to be related to the fact that we're navigating.
[04:37:31] <gabriel_schulhof> If you turn off the history for the popup, it does not scroll to top when you then .append()
[04:38:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I've tried putting breakpoints on all our .scrollTo() statements, and it's none of them.
[04:38:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Might be a browser bug.
[04:38:48] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #7318: Rails Assets: gseguin/jquery-hashchange has no versions defined 02http://git.io/zMNhTg
[04:39:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you sure its not where we scroll to maintain the scroll position
[04:39:44] <arschmitz> we changed how that worked in 1.4.4
[04:39:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've just noticed that we also .scrollTop( value )
[04:40:03] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll put breakpoints there too.
[04:40:35] <gabriel_schulhof> It's interesting though that it works if you .append() and then .scrollBy() vs. .scrollBy() and then .append()
[04:40:58] <gabriel_schulhof> ... since they're both synchronous, the problem should show up in both cases.
[04:41:12] <arschmitz> yeah that is odd
[04:42:18] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. The only place where we .scrollTop( newValue ) is in autogrow, so that's irrelevant to this problem.
[04:45:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I don't see why the OP can't simply append and then scroll. I mean, what's the difference?
[04:45:10] <arschmitz> ok
[04:45:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Maybe I should try to reproduce this without the lib.
[04:45:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well if it is a browser bug then thats what i would tell them
[04:45:43] <arschmitz> if its something we are doing we should try and find the issue
[04:45:47] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll try to repro without jQM.
[04:58:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Bam! Browser bug: http://jsbin.com/gaporifikifa/1

[05:37:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i already looked actually
[05:37:38] <gabriel_schulhof> So, what do you think?
[05:37:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: first email i read this morning
[05:38:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I blamed it, and it seems it was made that way to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2644
[05:38:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think we should fix it for sure
[05:38:48] <gabriel_schulhof> When going to a non-path URL, path.getDocumentRoot() is used instead of path.getLocation() to construct the URL being passed to replaceState
[05:39:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I suspect the reason for that may be gone.
[05:39:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/2f974cf3d206c7d309cc14e9f356251471fd236d/js/navigation/path.js#L297
[05:40:25] <gabriel_schulhof> That line goes all the way back to c297f9675b08246393eb649ccf2831d426b2b6bf
[05:40:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i know the problem
[05:40:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its our use of base
[05:40:58] <arschmitz> and the timing of the nav
[05:42:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I can take the ignorant approach: Call .getLocation() unconditionally and see if https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2644 re-appears.
[05:42:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well thats my guess anyway
[05:42:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[05:43:10] <gabriel_schulhof> We should have a test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2644 anyway, so this is a good excuse to add one.
[05:43:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[05:44:09] <arschmitz> and sore still
[05:44:14] <arschmitz> oops
[05:44:17] <arschmitz> ha ha
[05:44:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Get well soon :)
[05:45:10] <arschmitz> ha ha not me
[05:45:12] <arschmitz> my son
[05:45:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, may /he/ get well soon :)
[05:45:55] <arschmitz> thanks
[05:46:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, here goes nothing. Running the nav tests after making that inocuous change.
