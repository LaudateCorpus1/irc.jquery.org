[07:04:00] <_zoggy_> kinda neat.. figured that may be helpful to design
[07:04:29] <jzaefferer> thanks _zoggy_
[07:22:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just updated grund-css and grunt-html, now specifying grunt under devDependencies, instead of dependencies. Makes installing grunt plugins a lot faster, as it doesn't need to install grunt for every plugin
[07:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> oh, nice

[12:30:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, about [ThemeRoller should allow changing the page background color] do you think it's really necessary to give user the ability to pick a color, or switching from light to dark is enough?
[12:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We should probably automatically pick a color. Hunt down Scott Jehl and ask him what the best solution would be.
[12:31:21] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, why him
[12:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> Because he'll know if we should be using inverted colors or just black and white.
[12:32:15] <rxaviers> (just want to understand skills/responsibilities)
[12:32:16] <rxaviers> ok
[12:34:46] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8673 I can see a use case
[12:43:14] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Scott Jehl is one of the Filament Group guy, they originally wrote ThemeRoller
[12:43:29] <jzaefferer> Mat "Wilto" is here as well, but he wasn't at FG when ThemeRoller was created

[14:32:51] <_zoggy_> you should progmatically swap colors for the labels on the bg color, ive posted the code in here before
[14:33:12] <_zoggy_> about light/dark font colors with regards to page bg color
[14:35:22] <_zoggy_>  The theme roller component labels/etc text should be black or white depending on bgcolor used

[18:52:41] <azbyin> hi all.. i think there is a bug in the new accordion heightStyle property
[18:53:03] <azbyin> it does *not* behave in the same way as "fillSpace: true"
[18:53:06] <azbyin> http://jsbin.com/ejaxen/1
[18:53:19] <azbyin> I will make the same example but with older jqueryui
[18:58:10] <azbyin> http://jsbin.com/ejaxen/2/
[18:59:00] <azbyin> ignore the accordion overflowing because I have set top to be 20px. but the older fillSpace:true actually made the accordion fill the height on the parent container
[18:59:23] <azbyin> while the newer heightStyle:"fill" is not giving the same behaviour
[20:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> azbyin: That accordion is absolutely positioned, which means it's not part of its parent's flow.
[20:40:36] <azbyin> scott_gonzalez, well yes. I was pointing out that the api change is not allowing an equivalent behaviour
[20:40:52] <azbyin> i.e. fillSpace: true is not really truly available in the new api
[20:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> What you mean is we don't reproduce undefined behavior.
[20:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> An absolutely positioned element is not part of its parent's flow, so expecting auto filling of your parent doesn't make any sense.
[20:44:02] <azbyin> umm.. ok i think i'm going about this in a wrong manner
[20:44:13] <azbyin> is there a way to make the accordion a fixed size?
[20:44:29] <azbyin> i.e. make it use the height property on the accordion div itself?
[20:45:14] <azbyin> i guess i need to wrap it up in another container div and set the height on that one and have the accordion heightStyle: "fill"
[21:03:47] <_zoggy_> azbyin, http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#no-auto-height ?
[21:04:41] <azbyin> _zoggy_, thanks.. but I want all of them to be the same *specified* height
[21:05:08] <azbyin> so the only option isto wrap them in a div and set height on that div and accordion to heightStyle:"fill"
[21:05:31] <_zoggy_> is the content the same?
[21:05:43] <azbyin> no it is not the same
[21:06:01] <_zoggy_> When you declare the accordion control div, you can put a height in the style tag for the div. Then you can set the fillSpace: true property to force the accordion control to fill that div space no matter what. This means you can set the height to whatever works best for you page.
[21:06:40] <azbyin> _zoggy_, did you see my example?
[21:06:46] <azbyin> thats pretty much what i was doing
[21:07:14] <azbyin> i set an explicit height on the accordion div and set fillSpace: true   (but this is with the old 1.8.x jqui
[21:07:42] <_zoggy_> yeah, so the default accordion.. will take the space you give it.. divide it up equally for each of the sections
[21:08:43] <_zoggy_> dunno looks like fill space example does what you want.. just need to have a container to put it in
[21:09:08] <_zoggy_> Because the accordion is comprised of block-level elements, by default its width fills the available horizontal space. To fill the vertical space allocated by its container, set the heightStyle option to "fill", and the script will automatically set the dimensions of the accordion to the height of its parent container.
[21:09:12] <_zoggy_> per the jui docs
