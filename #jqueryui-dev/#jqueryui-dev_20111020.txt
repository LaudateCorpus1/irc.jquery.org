[05:00:16] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, I just pushed an update for the widget-factory-docs repo
[05:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> yay :-)
[05:00:42] <jzaefferer> so far just a html-to-markdown conversion of your blog post, except for the Cleaning Up section, I actually edited that
[07:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I think we're gonna finally get position fractions merged this week :-)
[07:05:37] <kborchers> as long as i don't break the PR again ;)
[07:06:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do my comments on that PR make sense or have i not had enough coffee yet?
[07:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I know what you're saying
[07:07:36] <kborchers> ok
[07:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually fine with just the tests that we already have
[07:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> since it already works properly in master
[07:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> without all kinds of crazy logic
[07:09:24] <kborchers> ok, sounds good to me
[07:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> haha, inukshuk just +1'd adding a test
[07:11:57] <kborchers> yeah, just saw that ... if he wants to write it that's fine. ;) we could always add it after we merge
[07:19:47] <gnarf> omg brr

[07:21:28] <kborchers> inorite
[07:32:11] <kborchers> anyone willing to give me some feedback on this before I merge https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/92c61b3507690b5a4834303ffbef79aaa1c77f33
[07:32:12] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (19h, 33m ago): Menubar: Allow structures other than just UL/LI
[10:14:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: thoughts on this.doc vs. this.document for widget property?
[10:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> also this.win vs. this.window
[10:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/commit/e64522b7dd508c67c026b707b2f17b5133953114
[10:15:28] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (2d, 22h ago): Widget: Add references to the window and document.
[10:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: can we infer menuElement from this.element?
[10:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that limits it to the tag, which might not be specific enough
[10:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> also, I notice that this doesn't allow for other structures, just other tags
[10:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> still using this.element.chidren()
[10:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> though there's not opposite of .closest() to use
[10:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> actually, that might be fine
[10:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> can you just make sure that tables work?

[10:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:34:04] <kborchers> tables are tough though because of tbody
[10:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> ah, right, so there you go, we need something better than .children()
[10:34:35] <kborchers> ok
[10:34:45] <kborchers> i'll think on it
[10:55:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what questions?
[10:55:58] <jzaefferer> doc vs document
[10:56:11] <jzaefferer> "for widget property"? what's the context?
[10:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> see the link right after the question
[10:57:33] <jzaefferer> pro document and window
[10:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> ok
