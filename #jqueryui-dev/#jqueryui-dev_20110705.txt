[09:59:05] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, saw your menu pull request
[09:59:15] <jzaefferer> gonna review it asap (which could still take a while...)
[10:00:59] <kborchers> hah, cool
[10:01:30] <jzaefferer> uh, actually not that much changed
[10:01:35] <jzaefferer> gonna pull that after this meeting...
[10:02:03] <kborchers> cool, while i have you, did you see my comment on Menubar? just wondering if autoExpand should also close on mouseleave or just leave it open like default functionality
[12:50:38] <MetaJake> I do not understand  that when I link to the jqueryui base stylesheet at googleapis.com it will not be over-rided by inline styles. But when I link to the same exact stylesheet from my own server, it can be over-rided by inline styling. Might anyone suggest why that might be?
