[08:03:56] <Omar-> !ping jasperdegroot
[08:04:11] <jasperdegroot> Omar-: hey!
[08:05:03] <Omar-> hi jasperdegroot
[08:05:25] <Omar-> you're absolutely correct. setting padding/margin to 0 solves the problem
[08:05:47] <Omar-> never thought of it :/
[08:05:48] <Omar-> haha
[08:05:57] <jasperdegroot> :)
[08:06:43] <jasperdegroot> Omar-: do you want to create a PR for it?
[08:08:15] <Omar-> It is okay, it faster on your side. If you dont mind, please go a head and create one :)
[08:08:29] <jasperdegroot> Omar-: ok, will do
[08:08:37] <Omar-> thanks again :)
[08:08:54] <jasperdegroot> Omar-: no problem :) thanks for reporting the issue
[08:13:04] <Omar-> my pleasure jasperdegroot :)
[08:13:12] <Omar-> hi arthurvr. you're late again!
[08:13:23] <Omar-> ;)
[08:13:30] <arthurvr> Omar-: ;)
[08:13:38] <Omar-> how r u?
[08:14:44] <Omar-> jasperdegroot as you know, beforechange emits "data" twice as an "object" on first run/framework init
[08:15:14] <arschmitz> Omar-: as i mentioned the other day thats not a bug
[08:15:15] <arschmitz> its correct
[08:15:16] <Omar-> is it possible to make it emit a string? like in later stages upon navigating internaly
[08:15:23] <arschmitz> it will not change
[08:15:23] <Omar-> arschmitz hi
[08:15:30] <Omar-> I know it's not a bug
[08:15:51] <Omar-> but i'm just wondering if it possible to let it return a string and then an object
[08:15:54] <arschmitz> Omar-: and it wont change the second trigger is already deprecated AND it should be an object both times
[08:15:57] <arschmitz> not its not
[08:16:01] <arschmitz> no*
[08:16:32] <arschmitz> Omar-: its always an object when the page is already in the dom because its refering to that page not to a url
[08:16:38] <arschmitz> its only a string as a url
[08:16:45] <arschmitz> in this case its never a url
[08:17:11] <arschmitz> Omar-: first load is a special case because it inital load there is no previous page
[08:17:33] <Omar-> true, first load moves from fake page to true page
[08:17:55] <arschmitz> Omar-: its not a fake page its just nothing
[08:17:57] <arschmitz> its undefined
[08:18:07] <Omar-> during that transition, it would be nice to have the possibility tp redirect user before first page is shown
[08:18:19] <Omar-> to*
[08:18:29] <arschmitz> Omar-: we need a base to start from
[08:18:35] <arschmitz> so that would result in broken navigation
[08:18:59] <Omar-> a fake page would be the base ;)
[08:19:16] <arschmitz> execpt that could result in navigation to a fake page
[08:19:20] <arschmitz> and a broken state
[08:19:21] <Omar-> I never thought it would break navigation
[08:19:21] <arschmitz> not ok
[08:20:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: and all that aside its been deprecated since 1.4
[08:20:36] <Omar-> you mean the second trigger?
[08:20:42] <arschmitz> yes
[08:20:49] <Omar-> only for first run, not all
[08:20:53] <Omar-> right?
[08:21:02] <arschmitz> no everywhere
[08:21:11] <arschmitz> it will only trigger once per navigation sequence
[08:21:20] <Omar-> so always beforechange will return an object only?
[08:21:24] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jaspermdegroot opened issue #7933: Incorrect body height when ui-mobile-viewport is not the body element 02https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7933
[08:21:33] <arschmitz> no
[08:21:41] <arschmitz> other then inital load it will always be a string
[08:21:55] <arschmitz> the new pagebeforetransition will replace the second one
[08:22:00] <arschmitz> and always be an object
[08:22:19] <arschmitz> well pagecontainerbeforetransition
[08:22:21] <arschmitz> not page
[08:22:43] <Omar-> nice, good to know
[08:23:03] <Omar-> beforechange for string and beforetransition for object
[08:23:09] <arschmitz> yes
[08:23:12] <Omar-> valuable info :)
[08:23:15] <arschmitz> and that is already the case
[08:23:19] <arschmitz> that started in 1.4
[08:24:07] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://jquerymobile.com/changelog/1.4.0/#navigation 4th down in navigation
[08:24:51] <arschmitz> Omar-: followed by http://jquerymobile.com/changelog/1.4.3/#pagecontainer
[08:25:11] <Omar-> when 1.4 was released I had no idea how properly use beforechange, so I didn't understand the purpose :)
[08:25:51] <arschmitz> http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/#event-beforetransition
[08:27:11] <Omar-> The configuration options to be used for the current change() call.
[08:27:18] <Omar-> what does that mean?
[08:27:41] <Omar-> change() is "change" in pagecontainer("change")?
[08:30:20] <arschmitz> yes

[10:51:59] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: ping!
[10:53:14] <rxaviers> jasperdegroot, hi
[10:53:24] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: hi
[10:53:44] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: Just saw your comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1436#commitcomment-9402479
[10:54:08] <rxaviers> ok removing the url, but we gotta revert the comments
[10:54:29] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: Jorn said that you two tested today... was the missing comments for shadow causing issues?
[10:55:57] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: because there we also removed some comments (for border radius and opacity)
[10:56:03] <rxaviers> these? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/a2db6209ca77c901b0195683d330d1d8c935bb12
[10:56:17] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: yes
[10:56:25] <rxaviers> yeap good point
[10:56:41] <rxaviers> it breaks other themes that need those variables
[10:57:08] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: what other themes?
[10:57:25] <rxaviers> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/ (see gallery)
[10:57:47] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: ah ok, see what you mean
[10:58:10] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: but those should also use the same CSS for shadow
[10:58:46] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: because it's no longer in tooltip.css
[10:59:31] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ^
[11:00:15] <jasperdegroot> how are those other themes generated? do they use base theme.css as template?
[11:00:22] <rxaviers> yeap
[11:00:44] <rxaviers> TR uses the theme.css of the respective release, replace the variables with the base values.
[11:01:02] <rxaviers> the base values = the theme values
[11:01:32] <jasperdegroot> then I think the thing to look into is making sure that the other themes in the gallery don't set values that we don't use anymore
[11:02:06] <rxaviers> that would require a TR for 1.12, another for older.
[11:02:37] <rxaviers> or a TR that's version-aware
[11:03:20] <jasperdegroot> an ugly hack would be doing something like ... /*/*{opacityShadow}*/*/
[11:04:12] <jasperdegroot> then the comment can be replaced with the variable but it will still be commented out (if the regex doesn't remove the outer /* */)
[11:07:08] <rxaviers> what's the benefit of the extra comment?
[11:09:12] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: to prevent that when /*{opacityShadow}*/ is replaced by a value, this value becomes part of the CSS
[11:09:50] <jasperdegroot> we don't want those values in the CSS 
[11:11:26] <rxaviers> As long as we want to support the themes from the gallery, all changes to themes.css must keep all variables. Their value can be null. But, the variables must be present.
[11:11:31] <jzaefferer> "TR uses the theme.css of the respective release, replace the variables with the base values." - so how are missing variables for ui-widget-shadow in 1.12 a problem for older releases?
[11:11:58] <rxaviers> They are not a problem for older releases
[11:12:21] <jzaefferer> They are a problem in 1.12?
[11:13:22] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: ^
[11:13:59] <rxaviers> When other themes need to set those variables, they are not present. They are ignores.
[11:14:04] <rxaviers> ignores = ignored
[11:14:11] <rxaviers> Unless this isn't a problem.
[11:14:26] <jasperdegroot> "need to set those variables"
[11:14:37] <jasperdegroot> I think that's problem
[11:14:59] <rxaviers> It would inevitably lead to dead TR settings
[11:15:01] <jasperdegroot> no UI 1-12 should need to set something like shadow opacity
[11:15:17] <jasperdegroot> because we don't use shadow opacity anymore
[11:16:40] <jasperdegroot> if we keep the comment in the CSS and it will be replaced with a value it will break the CSS
[11:16:56] <rxaviers> Ok for me. But, it's important that this is clear. Themes from gallery that tweaks those variables will have no effect on 1.12. We need to raise a list of the themes that will be impacted.
[11:19:18] <jasperdegroot> we only used things like border-radius and opacity for shadow to fake the real thing (box-shadow)
[11:19:28] <jasperdegroot> I think no one will miss those settings
[11:19:42] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I doubt they saw much use at all
[11:20:02] <jzaefferer> box-shadow has been well supported for a long time
[11:20:06] <rxaviers> ok

[12:26:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7927/files#diff-026980f3c131b5a0fc1d5a89a595d92aR937
[12:26:59] <arschmitz> there are 2 on some lines 3 on others with no rhyme or reason
[12:27:15] <arschmitz> and its not related to the 100char limit
[12:27:23] <arschmitz> even one with 4 
[12:28:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, then I'll just wrap them around 100.
[12:29:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thank you
[12:29:51] <arschmitz> it almost looked like they were just going for a visual block?
[12:30:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I think so, or maybe wrapped at 80 chars.
[12:30:44] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or 50 chars O_o
[12:30:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo ... gone now.
[12:48:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ummm ... how do https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7934 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7931 (now closed) interact? Do you want me to prepend the test to jasperdegroot's branch?
[12:48:56] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: Shall we combine https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7934 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7931?
[12:49:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you either need to just fix the test in its own pr
[12:49:26] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: or you can add a commit to jaspers and rebase so that commit is first
[12:50:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I can just squash my test fix into jasperdegroot's commit. I really don't mind, and that way, the test fix will be together with the modification that caused the breakage.
[12:50:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It seems like any modification to that rule is causing breakage.
[12:52:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is it cool if I land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7934 with my test fix squashed in?
[12:53:01] <gabriel_schulhof> ... after making sure that it passes, of course.
[12:55:59] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, NM. This can be done without history alteration. I'll let jasperdegroot land it.

[12:57:17] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: When you land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7934, please squash my commit into yours, so the breakage and the updated test are in the same commit.
[12:57:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that sounds good ^^
[12:58:21] <gabriel_schulhof> K, well, I pushed the updated test to issue-7933 ... lessee ...
[13:00:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Local phantom is green ... local desktop Chrome has rounding errors ... local desktop FF is green ... local bleeding-edge Chromium is green.
[13:06:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think cdn.rawgit.com is getting a bit flaky. We're getting lots of spurious errors in the casper tests for the page events.
[13:07:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Or, rather, it's /acting/ a bit flaky.
[13:21:10] <jzaefferer> "after a couple weeks of debate jzaefferer scott_gonzalez and i all agreed on many .hasClass" - did I?
[13:21:12] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: ^
[13:21:36] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: also, what's the status of classes?
[13:24:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i thought you agreed when i broguht up yesterday aftermeeting?
[13:24:52] <arschmitz> am i crazy?
[13:26:27] <travis-ci> jquery/jquery-mobile#2282 (master - e0c8376 : Jasper de Groot): The build was broken.
[13:26:27] <travis-ci> Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/31cc90ddc8c0...e0c83765ee47
[13:26:27] <travis-ci> Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/47950215
[13:29:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: still finishing updates after yesterdays meeting on classes was doing mobile stuff all day today
[13:39:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I can't remember agreeing yesterday, but "aftermeeting" was pretty late, kind of like it is now... I'm okay with it. If there's cases where .attr(class) comparison is better, we can still use it, no need to rewrite everything
[13:40:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah there are cases attr is better but most i think are better suited for hasClass
[13:40:21] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: as for classes/button - I made good progress on integrating the new theme in themeroller today, so that might be done pretty soon, leaving classes and button the only remaining blockers for 1.12
[13:40:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: builder
[13:40:36] <arschmitz> is still a huge blocker
[13:41:09] <jzaefferer> builder?
[13:41:32] <arschmitz> Yeah for 1.12 / 1.5 builder needs to handle css dependencies and work for mobile
[13:41:50] <arschmitz> this has been brought up a bunch of time but keeps getting pushed back
[13:42:25] <jzaefferer> Either I forgot or I was never aware of this being a blocker for 1.12
[13:42:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer yup
[13:42:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: rxaviers_ and gseguin|away|awa had a plan
[13:42:57] <arschmitz> but i dont think they ever started on it
[13:43:33] <jzaefferer> now this actually represents our roadmap: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/16?V=1.12.0
[13:43:37] <arschmitz> mobile's builder cant work with the new ui files so the plan was to move to the ui builder but that means it needs to properly handle css dependencies
[13:43:53] <jzaefferer> I'm pretty sure that they did something in that area
[13:43:59] <arschmitz> they talked about it
[13:44:02] <jzaefferer> I can work with Rafael on it after the theme stuff is done
[13:44:03] <arschmitz> but nothing has been done
[13:44:15] <arschmitz> the plan was to use the mobile style comments
[13:44:25] <arschmitz> and parse them into amd 
[13:44:26] <arschmitz> for the css
[13:44:54] <jzaefferer> we definitely have an issue for that
[13:44:55] <arschmitz> also discussed at one point is that for like button you should be able to include just the css while excluding the JS
[13:45:11] <arschmitz> since you can have css only buttons
[13:45:17] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/178
[13:45:52] <arschmitz> they never updated that
[13:45:55] <arschmitz> with the plan from chicago
[13:45:59] <jzaefferer> css only, like this? https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/246
[13:46:04] <arschmitz> which was to use amd under the hood
[13:46:25] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: kinda like that
[13:46:43] <arschmitz> this would be to include the structure of a component through builder
[13:46:47] <arschmitz> but not the js
[13:46:58] <arschmitz> for example this also comes up with select menu
[13:47:05] <arschmitz> which depends on button css but not the js
[13:48:13] <arschmitz> in mobile this is handled by button actually being part of core
[13:48:22] <arschmitz> but this is not really the right way to do it i dont think
[13:52:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: feel free to comment on that issue
[13:52:28] <arschmitz> Ill comment on both
[13:52:28] <jzaefferer> as for css/amd stuff: I still don't know what you're talking about. The Chicago team meeting minutes don't mention this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xPU19JajWBro763SU-cuk_CFyXxSO7ppY9knt_icQDs/edit#
[13:53:00] <arschmitz> It was just rxaviers_ and gseguin|away|awa that came up with the plan
[13:53:02] <jzaefferer> It seems to me like what's tracked in that ticket hasn't changed since early last year, its just not done yet, but rxaviers_ says there is no blocker for him
[13:53:03] <arschmitz> and they told us all
[13:53:08] <arschmitz> guess it never got written down
[13:53:31] <arschmitz> the reason was
[13:53:40] <arschmitz> that the plain mobile style comments will break
[13:53:40] <jzaefferer> well, can you just comment on the ticket?
[13:53:45] <arschmitz> as soon as we include those in mobile
[13:53:48] <jzaefferer> I've got no memory of the discussion and nothing to add anyway
[13:53:52] <arschmitz> because they will map to files that dont exist
[13:53:56] <jzaefferer> and this discussion will be lost as well
[13:54:03] <arschmitz> so we need an amd style paths config
[13:54:11] <arschmitz> to remap the css dependencies to the mobile file
[13:54:20] <jzaefferer> please put that in the issue :-)
[13:54:25] <arschmitz> i will
[13:56:06] <jzaefferer> thanks
[13:56:26] <jzaefferer> PS: regarding https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/241#issuecomment-71106133 - if you put a comma before and after the "too", it becomes even more readable ;)
[13:57:00] <arschmitz> fixed lol
[14:37:53] <gseguin> arschmitz: I think slexton vouched for that plan too but I'm not a 100% sure
[14:38:51] <gseguin> arschmitz: indeed the goal was to have some sort of enforcement that the css file existed and crash the build if it didn't
[15:00:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i thought it was something like that i remember you telling me after you talked to rxaviers about it
