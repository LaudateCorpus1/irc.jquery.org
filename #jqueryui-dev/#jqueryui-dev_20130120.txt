[13:51:41] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06grunt-0-4 147f38189 15JÃ¶rn Zaefferer: Build: Migrate to grunt 0.4. Rename to Gruntfile, upgrade to newer grunt-css and grunt-html, update custom tasks. Drop qunit-junit plugin, not worth the trouble. Update release script to run grunt-prepare after npm-install.
