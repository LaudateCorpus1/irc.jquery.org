[02:58:25] <NiGhTTraX> scott_gonzalez: can I talk to you for a min about the documentation fix?
[02:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[02:58:59] <NiGhTTraX> I looked through the XML files and saw that every event includes another XML files which contains the description of the arguments
[02:59:08] <NiGhTTraX> so every event has an identical description about the arguments
[02:59:33] <NiGhTTraX> should I go ahead and not include the file and write my own description for the remove event?
[02:59:49] <NiGhTTraX> or should I transform the file?
[03:00:03] <NiGhTTraX> (I'm guessing that's possible somehow with XSLT...)
[03:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[03:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> I guess just copy the contents of the include and then remove the sender.
[03:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> Sortable is the only widget that uses an include for events.
[03:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> But it makes sense.
[03:02:56] <NiGhTTraX> ok
[03:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if we can do recursive includes to avoid the duplication.
[03:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> So just copy/paste should work fine. It's certainly in line with every other widget that has common data across events.
[03:04:42] <NiGhTTraX> alright, filing the issue and sending the PR in a min
[03:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.

[07:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Adobe products work on OS X :-)
[07:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> What do you need to know about line endings?
[07:34:58] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: never ever
[07:36:30] <fnagel> I need to know what's the best way to run the unit tetss locally on windows. teh lineendings tests break as they check for CF. I assume the best way would be to add a gitattribute file forcing *nix endings in my local repo?
[07:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> Does git automatically use the OS's native line endings on checkout?
[07:38:25] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: Looks like core uses gitattributes: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.gitattributes
[07:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> If that fixes it, we can certainly add that.
[07:39:07] <fnagel> Git default is auto, which will checkout files in Win style aka CRLF 
[07:39:59] <fnagel> I'm not quite sure if adding "* text eol=lf" to gitatrributes will have unwanted side effects
[07:40:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Line endings ae a problem on OSX as well, Windoze uses CRLF, OSX uses CR, and POSIX uses LF (AFAIK)
[07:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: core has this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.gitattributes#L1
[07:40:50] <fnagel> Seems valid, I would add "text" as for example zip files (or other binaries) could break on checkout
[07:40:54] <_|Nix|_> fnagel: It should fix it, but expect intermittent problems.
[07:41:17] <fnagel> _|Nix|_: thats what I fear
[07:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: But most editors are smart enough to use LF on OS X.
[07:41:37] <_|Nix|_> fnagel: I'm not sure if using cygwin might make your life easier.
[07:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> You should ask DaveMethvin about this.
[07:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> He's our Windows hero.
[07:42:40] <_|Nix|_> fnagel: I always use cygwin on Windows. rxvt + bash === real terminal
[07:42:55] <_|Nix|_> fnagel: Dunno about line endings though ...
[07:46:00] <fnagel> _|Nix|_: I have only limited experience with cygwin, seems like another layer of complexity. When I need "real" bash I use a VM (mostly when developing Symfony2 or TYPO3). Do you have a hgood tutorial as a starting point? 
[07:48:30] <fnagel> DaveMethvin: can you join us here? Question is how to deal with lineendings on Windows (CRLF eof) regarding unit tests (which check for LF eol)
[07:48:45] <DaveMethvin> here
[07:48:59] <DaveMethvin> catching up
[07:49:47] <DaveMethvin> right, whatever we did in core was because of me and Windows :)
[07:50:08] <DaveMethvin> we also have a check to ensure that the built files don't have CRLF in them
[07:50:21] <DaveMethvin> just in case they somehow get checked in
[07:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We likely copied that from you, but didn't copy the gitattributes, so ours doesn't work on Windows :-P
[07:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> We also copied the UTF-8 check, but at least for that one I can say that I came up with the solution :-P
[07:51:54] <DaveMethvin> that was the jshint check, right?
[07:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> No, this custom one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/tasks/dist.js#L41
[07:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> I remembered you were worried about perf.
[07:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> And I had luckily just dealt with this issue tracking down an XML-RPC bug.
[07:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm gonna get lunch and finish waking up.
[07:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: When I get back, I should be functional again. I'll ping you to see what we should do for today's announcement.
[07:56:10] <DaveMethvin> great scott_gonzalez i'm running out here soon for about an hour but made a lot of progress on the standards blog post
[07:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, great. When you get back, let me know.
[08:00:37] <fnagel> DaveMethvin: So, we could copy the gitattrribute to UI repo?
[08:00:51] <DaveMethvin> yes that should work
[08:01:08] <fnagel> Ahh, sorry, I'm in a meeting now :-/

[09:40:24] <rxaviers> yep
[09:40:39] <tj_vantoll> I'm free until 1:00. So it has to be quick but yes.
[09:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/186
[09:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> I could see it going in either place, api.jqueryui.com or learn.jquery.com.
[09:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone knows of other environments, we should add those too.
[09:43:57] <gseguin> Grant___Y: This is the developer channel. For support go to #jquery or to the forums. Thanks.
[09:44:45] <tj_vantoll> It seems more like learn site material.
[09:45:24] <fnagel> Anyone else habing problems with http://irc.jquery.org/ ? I wanted to check the IRC log to see what happend to the EOL issue on Windows but it wont work
[09:45:30] <tj_vantoll> It's more of a tutorial format, which doesn't fit in with the current API doc structure.
[09:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> So, I don't actually know how to use most of these.
[09:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> I've just come across them over time.
[09:45:44] <tj_vantoll> ditto
[09:46:33] <tj_vantoll> We could start with AMD.
[09:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:47:03] <tj_vantoll> What's the porting that's referenced in that issue?
[09:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably document both our upcoming official support and AMD for UI <1.11.0
[09:47:28] <tj_vantoll> I agree. But ugh.
[09:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, just general "how to use jQuery UI" stuff from the old docs.jquery.com content.
[09:47:52] <tj_vantoll> Did any of that make it to learn?
[09:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's all there.
[09:48:09] <tj_vantoll> ah ok
[09:48:19] <tj_vantoll> It makes that issue a bit confusing to read through.
[09:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/getting-started/
[09:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> It wasn't what the issue was about.
[09:48:46] <tj_vantoll> Gotcha
[09:49:18] <rxaviers> I was following the port too, thought it had anything to do with new content... :S
[09:49:25] <rxaviers> with the*
[09:49:52] <rxaviers> But, ok nm. Issue is still open.
[09:49:56] <rxaviers> Nice list.
[09:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:50:05] <tj_vantoll> So I'm thinking a new learn page "Using jQuery UI in Different Environments"
[09:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[09:50:22] <tj_vantoll> That is a landing page that links to pages on specific environments.
[09:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good. And we'll just start with AMD for now.
[09:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably just ask the maintainers for each of the various packages if they're interested in writing their respective pages.
[09:52:34] <tj_vantoll> Agreed.
[09:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> Once we have the AMD page written, we can point to that as an example.
[09:52:39] <rxaviers> +1
[09:53:10] <tj_vantoll> I'll add this to my list.
[09:54:07] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, just let me know once you have something ready for review. I'd be happy to.
[09:54:21] <NiGhTTraX> scott_gonzalez: got a minute? I think I found another documentation bug on sortable
[09:54:26] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/186#issuecomment-32390520
[09:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> NiGhTTraX: sure
[09:54:32] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: ok, will do.
[09:55:00] <NiGhTTraX> the remove event description says it will fire once an item is _dragged_ outside the sortable and into another
[09:55:10] <NiGhTTraX> it actually fires when the item is _dropped_ into another sortable
[09:57:07] <NiGhTTraX> kind of a huge difference imho 
[09:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is it the same for receive?
[09:57:28] <NiGhTTraX> checking now, one sec
[09:58:02] <NiGhTTraX> yep, fires only when dropped
[09:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> The action in the current description (not actully dropping, just dragging) would just result in over and out events, right?
[09:58:27] <NiGhTTraX> yes
[09:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> Want to send a PR to make the description for receive and remove accurate and clear?
[09:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> The receive description isn't very clear right now.
[09:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're defining what receive means by using recieve :-/
[09:59:34] <scott_gonzalez> We should use dropped.
[09:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or just expand the sentence to make it clear.
[09:59:59] <NiGhTTraX> would love to but I was actually thinking if it would be better to modify the code to fire the events on dragging and not dropping
[10:00:14] <NiGhTTraX> I find it more useful that way
[10:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> Don't you get that same info from over and out?
[10:01:10] <NiGhTTraX> hmm
[10:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> over and out are like progress events.
[10:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> receive and remove are like complete events.
[10:01:34] <NiGhTTraX> well they're a bit different
[10:01:46] <NiGhTTraX> there's 2 cases with out events
[10:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, based on ui.sender.
[10:02:17] <NiGhTTraX> indeed
[10:03:49] <NiGhTTraX> actually, I just tested it right now, ui.sender is identical in both cases 
[10:04:03] <NiGhTTraX> dragging an item outside the sortable and dragging it over another sortable
[10:04:15] <NiGhTTraX> the attribute is set in both cases to the initial sortable
[10:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> Right, it will always be the initial sortable.
[10:06:19] <NiGhTTraX> so you can't tell from the out event if the item moved to another sortable
[10:06:35] <NiGhTTraX> which causes the placeholder to move from your list to the other
[10:06:41] <NiGhTTraX> which is the information I'm looking for
[10:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> Why don't you just listen for over events?
[10:11:58] <NiGhTTraX> I could but I'd have to bind a listener to the other sortable(s) and that's not a good solution imho
[10:12:19] <NiGhTTraX> I'd want it to work when moving to a vanilla sortable as well
[10:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by vanilla sortable?
[10:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> Also, you don't need to bind to the individual sortables, use delegation.
[10:13:29] <NiGhTTraX> sortable without my out event listener
[10:14:05] <NiGhTTraX> yeah but still, I'm writing a plugin so I'd have to delegate to body...
[10:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> Which is the right place to delegate to anyway (we'd actually use document).
[10:14:38] <NiGhTTraX> really? that's a good practice? 
[10:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:14:43] <NiGhTTraX> seems iffy to me
[10:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[10:15:47] <NiGhTTraX> because I'm listening to every over event of every sortable
[10:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what you want.
[10:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can bind and unbind as necessary, in reaction to single-fire events like start/stop.
[10:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> $( document ).on( "sortstart", function( event ) {
[10:17:38] <NiGhTTraX> I know it can be done and as less ugly as possible
[10:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> if sortable is connected to other sortables, bind to over
[10:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> We can't change the semantics of the existing events.
[10:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> We can add new ones, but that can't happen until the rewrite.
[10:18:11] <NiGhTTraX> how about another event, say 'transfer'
[10:18:20] <NiGhTTraX> rewrite?
[10:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> All interactions are being rewritten.
[10:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/interactions/
[10:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[10:20:53] <NiGhTTraX> oh
[10:21:03] <NiGhTTraX> I see
[10:22:58] <NiGhTTraX> roadmap seems interesting
[10:23:19] <NiGhTTraX> guess I'll have to delegate then
[10:24:05] <NiGhTTraX> in the mean time, I'll send a PR fixing the receive and remove docs
[10:24:09] <NiGhTTraX> should I file an issue first?
[10:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> You can just send the PR.
[10:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> We don't do changelogs for docs, so issues that will immediately be followed by a PR aren't necessary.
[10:29:49] <NiGhTTraX> ok
[10:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> thanks

[12:21:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, Im not sure what to do with timezone parsing. Because, we can't keep this info in the Date object (as far as I found out). All I can do is create a Date object with the equivalent time in the current timezone. But, that's not the same thing.
[12:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe store it on the date object as a property?
[12:23:02] <rxaviers> Do you know if there's any on-going spec for this?
[12:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[12:23:38] <rxaviers> But, yeap that's the best we could do I guess.
[12:23:50] <rxaviers> For comparison, dojo doesn't parse timezones.
[12:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> We could also create our own constructor and have it inherit from Date.
[12:25:19] <rxaviers> I guess this is what this (https://github.com/mde/timezone-js) do
[12:25:24] <rxaviers> does*
[12:26:35] <rxaviers> Although, I'm afraid of how much logic we'd had to add / reinvent.
[12:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> If it inherits, we shouldn't have to reinvent anything, right?
[12:30:07] <rxaviers> I should have picked a better word for reinvent. Actually, I was thinking more in terms of Globalize's scope compared to eg. moment.js
[12:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...inheriting doesn't seem to work too well with Date.
[12:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> So, the best I can come up with is storing it as a property.
[12:32:12] <rxaviers> ok ;) thanks

[12:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:53:49] <agcolom> thx!
[12:53:58] <agcolom> I'm landing this one:https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/219#issuecomment-32412923
[12:54:13] <agcolom> so I've checked out master... 
[12:54:35] <agcolom> there have been no changes to master since I made this branch
[12:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> So, if the commit message was correct, you'd be able to just merge it.
[12:55:46] <agcolom> yes
[12:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> But since it's not, we'll do the standard rebase that I do for everything.
[12:55:49] <agcolom> so I did git checkout trackpersistanttoolbars
[12:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout trackpersistanttoolbars
[12:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase -i master
[12:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> change "pick" to "r".
[12:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> Fix the commit message. Capital component, capital description, no period at end of description, closes on seperate line.
[12:57:44] <agcolom> ok, I think i've done that
[12:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout master
[12:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> git merge trackpersistanttoolbars
[12:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> You should get a fast forward.
[12:58:15] <agcolom> yes
[12:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> git push
[12:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> wait
[12:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> don't push
[12:59:01] <agcolom> too late :-(
[12:59:20] <agcolom> rejected
[12:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> If it was rejected then you were wrong about there not being changes to master.
[12:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> git reset --hard origin/master
[13:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> git pull
[13:00:46] <agcolom> git checkout trackpersistanttoolbars
[13:00:46] <agcolom> Switched to branch 'trackpersistanttoolbars'
[13:00:46] <agcolom> unknown-68:a8:6d:11:09:80:api.jquerymobile.com anne-gaellecolom$ git rebase master
[13:00:48] <agcolom> Current branch trackpersistanttoolbars is up to date.
[13:00:50] <agcolom> unknown-68:a8:6d:11:09:80:api.jquerymobile.com anne-gaellecolom$ git push upstream master
[13:00:52] <agcolom> Everything up-to-date
[13:00:54] <agcolom> at the time I did: 
[13:01:00] <agcolom> so I thought all was up to date?
[13:01:15] <agcolom> so I do git reset --hard origin/master
[13:01:17] <agcolom> ?
[13:01:20] <agcolom> and pull
[13:01:27] <agcolom> ?
[13:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, now I'm confused about what happened. What is that output from?
[13:01:44] <agcolom> before I spoke to you
[13:02:02] <agcolom> I was looking at what we did last time
[13:02:16] <agcolom> and was going through the same commands
[13:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, any time you're rebasing to land a PR, you're always going to do an interactive rebase.
[13:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> So, let's start from the beginning.
[13:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> # undo the merge
[13:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> git reset --hard upstream/master
[13:03:25] <scott_gonzalez> git pull upstream master

[13:03:46] <agcolom> Already up-to-date.
[13:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout trackpersistanttoolbars
[13:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase -i master
[13:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> You need to fix the commit message again, because it's still wrong :-)
[13:04:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: think you could add a test to the first one
[13:04:28] <agcolom> Switched to branch 'trackpersistanttoolbars'
[13:04:28] <agcolom> Your branch and 'origin/trackpersistanttoolbars' have diverged,
[13:04:28] <agcolom> and have 1 and 1 different commit(s) each, respectively.
[13:04:29] <agcolom> after the 1st comand I get: 
[13:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> Don't use "Closes gh-218" use "Fixes gh-218".
[13:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> And add "Closes gh-219" on the next line.
[13:05:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll see if we have any event code tests that I can model mine after.
[13:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Gist your commit message before you save it.
[13:06:29] <agcolom> re: Gist your commit message before you save it. ???
[13:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> Put it in a gist so I can see it.
[13:07:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Go to gist.github.com, paste in your commit message, save it, and give scott_gonzalez the resulting URL.
[13:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> She gists stuff for me to review all the time, I guess the use of gist as a verb is confusing.

[13:17:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but UI has no special events ...
[13:17:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they have draggable and dropppable and mouse though

[13:20:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we do actually have some event sequences in there ... it's mostly just .trigger( this" ); .trigger( "that" ); setTimeout( function() { .trigger( "theotherthing" ); }, 50 ); ... that kinda thing.

[13:21:02] <bdowling>  Here's the test..  http://jsfiddle.net/3uMY8/3/  What happens is one dialog will work, the other will have the overlay placed on top of it.  I think this happens because it was moved after being created, so the .siblings() call doesn't work right to fix the zindexing.  At least that's my theory.

[13:24:02] <bdowling> I'm trying to figure out if you guys think that is a bug in jqueryui I should submit or not..  I know the test case seems like a quirky thing to do, but I found the issue recently with mmenu in how it tries to wrap all your content..
[13:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a bug. Users shouldn't move dialogs.
[13:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> There's an appendTo option.
[13:28:42] <bdowling> I agree..  I found mmenu was doing a wrapAll() under the hood..  I wonder if there are other modules that might do this and wreak the same kind of havoc with dialogs..
[13:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> Why not just delay the creation of the dialogs until after calling mmenu?
[13:31:50] <bdowling> I noticed similar bugs being reported various times before, #8984, 9095, 7948, etc..  just figured there might be a fix to help the next guy ;)
[13:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> #8984 was an actual bug, which was fixed
[13:33:23] <bdowling> scott..  I would if I had more control over that order.  In this case, it was actually jTable creating it's dialogs.  so I'd have to delay jtable from doing its ajax fetching, etc which would be more user noticable.
[13:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> #7984 was a feature request, which was implemented
[13:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> Which just leaves #9095, which is the exact case you have.
[13:35:01] <scott_gonzalez> Which we just don't support.
[13:35:12] <bdowling> Just trying to understand.. is there a strict need to have the dialogs at the end of the body?  if some dialogs were moved with appendTo and others weren't, does this work ok?
[13:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> Just like jQuery doesn't support binding events and data and then not using plain DOM to remove the element.
[13:35:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Sorry to butt in, but would it be possible for bdowling to write an extension for dialog to add the desired behaviour?
[13:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> No, this is going outside the system to do something.
[13:36:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. NM.
[13:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> bdowling: That's not your problem.
[13:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that you're telling the dialog that it belongs at the end of the body, so it's putting the overlay there.
[13:38:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We no longer https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/72654a102825296f5dca9be31bc84b6cee4a1dd6 ... was that removed intentionally? I was thinking that we should maybe add a test that deals with finishing the swipe off-element.
[13:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then you're moving the dialog to not be where you told the widget it would be.
[13:39:36] <bdowling> ah, ok
[13:40:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was what removed?
[13:41:58] <bdowling> I'll push an issue over to mmenu guys then, a .not(".ui-widget") on their selector seems like an reasonable enough fix.
[13:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> bdowling: http://jsfiddle.net/3uMY8/4/
[13:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> Notice line 24
[13:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> bdowling: mmenu seems to have a ton of API surface, perhaps they can also add an option for which element is used as the wrapper, so you can provide your own in the markup and completely avoid the problem.
[13:44:57] <bdowling> they do, and I used that.  but in the default case it probably should tread more lightly?
[13:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> Meh. Interop across all JS libs is near impossible.
[13:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> At least out of the box.
[13:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> We do what we can to provide the hooks necessary for users to wire up the interop themselves though.
[13:46:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it binds all events to thisObject now.
[13:47:19] <arschmitz> that seems wrong
[13:47:33] <arschmitz> since i explicitly fixed it in that commit
[13:47:43] <arschmitz> unless there is a reason in a later commit
[13:47:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just noticed it because I did git log to see what other bugs have been ficed.
[13:47:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I haven't traced it, but I can ...
[13:48:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i susspect it might have been when we switched to trigger on hitting threshold rather then mouse up
[13:48:34] <bdowling> Ok..  thanks for the help Scott..  I'll work on getting PR #1144 splitup like you asked.
[13:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks bdowling.
[13:50:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, it's when you fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311 with 3367ec5c
[13:51:25] <arschmitz> ah ok
[13:52:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats also where the bubbeling changed
[13:53:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes. You changed it from .trigger() to jQuery.event.dispatch(), which does not bubble.
[13:53:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i switched it from using trigger to triggerCustomEvent which uses dispatch
[13:54:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. That stops the events from bubbling, but it still creates the appearance of bubbling, because mouse events reaching a deep element will also reach its parents because mouse events bubble.
[13:54:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if both a deep element and one of its parents have swipe handlers, the one sequence of mouse events will generate two distinct swipe events, one for the deep element, and one for the parent.
[13:55:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:55:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it looks like the event from the deep element is bubbling up to the parent, but in reality it's two flat events.
[13:56:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so yeah go ahead and fix that at the same time
[13:57:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll restore the listen-at-document-level thing.
[14:00:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we can bind both touchMoveEvent and touchStopEvent to the document, because we should be able to track across elements once we've decided that we're gonna start gathering mouse data for a possible touch event.
[14:01:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Especially since the change whereby swipe may be emitted before touchend was introduced later than the listen-at-document-level change.
[14:01:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: s/for a possible touch event/for a possible swipe event/
[14:02:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: makes sense
[14:03:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: let me know once your done
[14:03:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[14:03:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll force-push the branch from the PR.
[14:03:35] <arschmitz> im going to add my fix for the cords
[14:03:44] <arschmitz> and do a whole pile of swipe testing on devices
[14:04:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah! Look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5534
[14:04:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dunno if there's much we can do about that ...
[14:04:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah not sure
[14:04:46] <arschmitz> its chrome only
[14:04:51] <arschmitz> not the built in browser
[14:04:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and only on android ...
[14:04:58] <arschmitz> yup
[14:05:14] <arschmitz> i have not looked to far into it yet but need to
[14:05:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah ... Chrome on iOS is mostly just branding :)
[14:05:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ha! Chrome on iOS is mostly just ... chrome :P
[14:05:45] <arschmitz> lol
[14:05:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey gota run to pick my son up be back later

[14:59:09] <bdowling> @scott_gonzalez .. I'm back (after thinking along the drive)..  utoh :)
[15:02:03] <bdowling> in dialogs ._appendTo()  would it not be simpler to do default to parent() instead of "body" ??  e.g.  return this.document.find( element || this.parent() ).eq( 0 );
[15:03:53] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6950: External "header" toolbar ignores options - jQM 1.4 02http://git.io/uVNssw
[15:03:57] <bdowling> er rather this.element,parent()
[15:07:44] <bdowling> Well, actually, there is probably a case for _appendTo to have two different "defaults".  e.g. when it is called from createWrapper, it's good to default to "body", but when its called in _createOverlay it might be better to be .parent()
[15:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> bdowling: Please read http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/stacking-elements/
[15:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> There are years of trial and error in this.
[15:27:22] <bdowling> Thanks for the reading.  I don't think my suggesting conflicts with that, does it?
[15:35:37] <bdowling> the conflict comes when _moveToTop tries to adjust zindexes, by using this.uiDialog.siblings,  here zIndicies = this.uiDialog.siblings( ".ui-front:visible" ) it doesn't find the overlay.  if _appendTo returned parent() when inserting the overlay, the overlay would be over everything in that subtree except for the dialog as is intended in the end.    So I'm just suggesting since to function it depends on .siblings() in one case, .parent() would be 
[15:35:39] <bdowling> the inverse that should be used.  Making "body" the default for createWrapper does not change anything with regards to the stacking article.
