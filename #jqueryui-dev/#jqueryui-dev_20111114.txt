[06:23:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i left work early on Thursday and my home computer did not playback your message about .findFirst() not stopping at the first element but rather all elements on that level. that's what i was going for with .findUntil() though, which I am reworking
[06:24:16] <kborchers> for example, in menu when not depending on parent/child relationship
[06:24:28] <kborchers> findUntil would be able to find all elements on the same level
[06:24:37] <kborchers> "level"
[06:24:43] <kborchers> even if they are not siblings

[10:00:31] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jscheel: hey @jqueryui, this bug has been critical (then major) for 3 years. A patch was submitted 2 years ago. What gives? http://t.co/J8q3gA6g ★ http://bit.ly/sDg9e5
[11:50:16] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I have been working around that exact bug!
[13:25:33] <rpflo> what's up with ui.menu living with autocomplete?
[14:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: that was only in 1.8 because we didn't want to release menu
[14:18:18] <bot-t1> (24 hours 30 mins ago) <Dave_Stein> tell scott_gonzalez: isn't it strange everything in UI is namespaced, but widget puts data right into "draggable" rather than "ui.draggable" or something of that nature?
[14:18:19] <bot-t1> (24 hours 20 mins ago) <Dave_Stein> tell scott_gonzalez: also we are developing 2 on 1.6.4, shouldn't we push it to 1.7?
[14:18:19] <bot-t1> (22 hours 30 mins ago) <Dave_Stein> tell scott_gonzalez: actually Kris answerd that for me . I'll switch over later. Check out: https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js let me know if that's kosher to push upstream
[14:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell Dave_Stein everything has to be compatible with 1.6+
[14:20:31] <bot-t1> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
