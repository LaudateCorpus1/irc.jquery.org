[07:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: Shouldn't we ignore clicks on parent menu items? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8467
[07:21:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i have thought about that but i was thinking there may be some use case where a user may want to open something based on click of a parent item, no? i guess thinking in terms of native menus though, we should probably ignore them
[07:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should stick to how menus actually work :-P
[07:22:47] <kborchers> :P
[07:23:03] <kborchers> ok, i'll be working tonight so i can drop that in.
[07:24:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: the status menu in adium has various items with submenus, where the parent can be activated...
[07:24:27] <jzaefferer> for accounts, it'll toggle that account
[07:24:47] <jzaefferer> for the Disabled Accounts menu item, it'll just not do anything, just close the menu
[07:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[07:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> The default should definitely be to do nothing though.
[07:26:02] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i knew there had to be an example out there :)
[07:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps we should trigger the select event, but not close the menu?
[07:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> Then if someone wants to react to it they can call $( this ).menu( "close" ) inside the event handler?
[07:27:26] <kborchers> hmmm
[07:28:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i could go along with that
[07:29:40] <kborchers> we could add a little bit about that in the docs … i should be able to get all of that in tonight
[07:30:02] <kborchers> i haven't had a chance to work since the last meeting but i can get that css stuff pushed to a branch tonight for people to review as well
[07:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> cool
