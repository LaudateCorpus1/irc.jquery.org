[13:53:57] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/1-8-merge] Update dependencies, merge docs from master. - Scott González
[13:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> Can someone either look at that commit or decide that I'm amazing and need no review even when making massive changes while sleep deprived?
[13:55:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's only  91 changed files with 24,413 additions and 3,125 deletions. :-P
[13:56:03] <kborchers> +1 for amazing no review needed :D
[13:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Thanks. Merging now.
[13:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?!?
[13:58:34] <kborchers> :)
[13:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> It has to be better than the months-old out-of-date docs that were there, right?
[13:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> I only fell asleep twice while making the changes.

[14:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg kborchers: Thoughts on styling deprecated stuff on the API site? http://cl.ly/image/0p1I0l0b1m0S
[14:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> That option isn't actually deprecated, if it was it would say (deprecated x.y) at the end of the description.
[14:16:25] <kswedberg> I think it should have a dragon background image
[14:21:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! Sorry I need to borrow your brain! I have an issue with the api docs for mobile... the demos (very last bit on each page) won't show in FF but they are fine in Safari... (I pulled in your changes which I think was to upgrade grunt-jquery-content to 0.5.x. and then did an ntm install and  grunt deploy...
[14:22:24] <agcolom> when I look at the inspector in FF, the iframe content is there but faded, so it looks like something is not quite right....
[14:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'm seeing this: [17:22:08.477] NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMHistory.replaceState] @ http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.1/jquery.mobile-1.1.1.min.js:74
[14:23:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: interesting! Thanks...
[14:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> So the script must be dying before it unhides the div[data-role="page"] elements.
[14:25:08] <agcolom> ah!
[14:25:27] <agcolom> but strange that it's all fine in Safari...
[14:25:45] <agcolom> I didn't notice it before redeploying today...
[14:26:22] <agcolom> And I don't think that version of JQM was touched at all... as it is a final release
[14:27:16] <agcolom> could it be the grunt upgrade?
[14:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> You mean grunt-jquery-content?
[14:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> That shouldn't have affected how jQuery Mobile executes inside of the iframe.
[14:28:30] <agcolom> yes....
[14:28:37] <agcolom> I am confused!
[14:29:10] <agcolom> is the demo missing for you too in FF? (I tried FF14 and FF15)
[14:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Perhaps this? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/85eff77339d29de56607218a5627ec4d352747de
[14:30:32] <agcolom> maybe?
[14:32:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I made my previous change 7 days ago, and I think all was fine.
[14:32:58] <agcolom> your change in web-base-template was 14 days ago... would it get picked up autoatically or would have I needed to do a ntm install to get it?
[14:33:53] <agcolom> but then I think I tended to look at Safari, and maybe not FF systematically....
[14:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> You would need to `git pull` on your web-base-template checkout.
[14:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> I just went back to August 21 and it's broken in Firefox.
[14:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> So this isn't recent.
[14:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> I need to go. Dinner time.
[14:35:19] <agcolom> Have a nice dinner :-) Thanks for your help! At least we're heading in hte right direction :-)
[14:35:30] <agcolom> And it's bedtime for me...
