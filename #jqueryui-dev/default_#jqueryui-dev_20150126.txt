[04:27:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: how are those test fixes coming for ui-1-12?
[04:32:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it looks like the branch is close but there are some missing files in dialog sequence tests
[05:09:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:09:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm stuck on controlgroups containing checkboxradio widgets.
[05:09:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You said you'd take a look because those are supposed to work, but don't.
[05:09:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i thought i did and told you want it was?
[05:10:02] <arschmitz> or was that something different
[05:10:14] <gabriel_schulhof> That was something different.
[05:10:17] <arschmitz> oh ok
[05:10:28] <arschmitz> ill look this morning then 
[05:10:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I've also had a thought regarding nav.
[05:12:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think if we treat the hash as a storage mechanism without worrying about its size/legibility, we could implement any and all kinds of navigation using it. I mean, we could store an entire tree of nav steps in the hash, and the hash would get bigger and bigger as the user navigates along, and we could fully restore not only the current state upon refresh, but we could even create browser history entries so the user can go 
[05:13:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Hope all that came through without getting cut off by the server.
[05:13:14] <gabriel_schulhof> The question is, do we want to go all-out like that.
[05:14:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont think thats a good idea
[05:14:39] <arschmitz> a big part of what we have always claimed was pretty urls where possilbe
[05:14:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I'm not too fond of it either, but it serves as kind of a waypoint, to illustrate that a lot /is/ possible, though maybe not simple or desirable.
[05:15:12] <arschmitz> ok but if its a bad idea its a bad idea possible or not
[05:15:39] <arschmitz> and we should not encourage the use of bad ideas
[05:16:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I dunno ... some people might want that. I'm thinking we need not implement this, but we should, maybe, organize our code in such a way that it provides all the necessary extension points that such a scheme could be implemented. The reason I think that is that this scheme would be the most demanding of nav, so it would require the most extensibility of nav.
[05:17:31] <arschmitz> Maybe im not sure but either way i dont want to do anything with nav until after 1.5
[05:17:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ... which, on the flipside would mean that it would make nav as flexible as possible towards the implementation of various navigation schemes.
[05:17:57] <arschmitz> not even planning we need to get 1.5 finished and out
[05:18:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: No, definitely not. I was just thinking about what you said regarding that specific set of nav steps involving multiple page containers.
[05:18:36] <arschmitz> classes is likely to land this week on master and button is likely not far behind which means we are WAY WAY WAY behind
[05:18:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think this is what johnbender was talking about.
[05:18:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no john bender didnt want to handle at all
[05:19:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: he wanted to force all handling onto the server
[05:19:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see. I guess I saw the features, but not his idea for implementing them.
[05:20:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, back to being way, way, way behind. Please have a look at the controlgroup/checkboxradio thing, because that's all that's missing right now.
[05:20:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there are still failing tests on that branch
[05:20:29] <arschmitz> in nav
[05:21:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Really? The only ones I had failing were column toggle table - precisely because the popup contains a controlgroup with checkboxradio widgets.
[05:21:15] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll run the suite again.
[05:21:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats what github says
[05:21:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: or travis rather
[05:21:48] <arschmitz> uri not found for some dialog sequence pages
[05:22:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right. That's probably an easy fix. I should've skipped over the table tests rather than stop at them.
[05:22:55] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll fix that quickly.
[05:26:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Which PR causes ui-1-12-tests to be submitted to Travis?
[05:26:56] <arschmitz> i looked at the branch it self
[05:26:58] <arschmitz> not a pr
[05:27:38] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so you ran the tests. OK. I'm running the nav tests now.
[05:32:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is it OK if I add ui-1-12-test to .travis.yml?
[05:33:04] <arschmitz> yes
[05:35:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[05:35:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... all my nav tests pass ... maybe it was selectmenu or something, which also opens/closes dialogs.
[05:36:13] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll run the whole enchilada.
[05:36:25] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06ui-1-12-tests: 02http://git.io/-AMvOg
[05:36:25] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06ui-1-12-tests 147442a5a 15Gabriel Schulhof: Build: Add branch ui-1-12-tests to travis
[05:45:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... there are indeed more failures with different versions of jQuery.
[05:46:10] <gabriel_schulhof> For example, with 1.8.3, filterable and transitions integration tests also fail.
[05:46:57] <arschmitz> oh weird
[05:47:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, and weirder still, they're fine in Chrome :(
[05:47:45] <gabriel_schulhof> So, it's gonna be fun tracking it down using phantom's wonderful debugging capabilities (=== console.log)
[05:48:36] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the worst part is, it's just a failure. Boom. No messages, just "PhantomJS timed out...
[05:48:39] <gabriel_schulhof> "
[05:49:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: try in browserstack on like safari 4 or 5
[05:49:14] <arschmitz> phantom is somewhere in the middle as i recall
[05:49:21] <arschmitz> more or less
[05:50:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I dunno which is slower, BS + safari + developer tools, or native + phantomjs + console.log ...
[05:50:50] <arschmitz> lol
[05:51:16] <gabriel_schulhof> As for build status, it's totally useless, because the casperjs tests will fail for sure. So, you need to always dig in and check the qunit tests.
[05:51:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh because of selectmenu 
[05:53:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there is an easy fix for that
[05:53:56] <gabriel_schulhof> I was thinking of only running grunt test rather than grunt test coveralls crawl
[05:54:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you can just comment out the controlgroup demo pages in the menu
[05:54:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i need to get us using the new grunt spider
[05:55:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: which has a an ignore array and blacklists
[05:55:03] <arschmitz> for things like this
[05:55:39] <arschmitz> instead our old custom hacked one
[05:56:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well execpt we could not pass the new one i dont think even on master lol
[05:56:22] <arschmitz> its a lot stricter 
[05:56:40] <arschmitz> like it fails on permanent redirects not just 404
[05:56:54] <arschmitz> but the error output is SOOOO MUCH BWETTER
[05:57:10] <arschmitz> and actually correct which our version is not always
[05:57:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Holy shitsu! travis is nuts! Wow! There's sooo much to fix!
[05:58:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well you worry about that stuff and ill take care of the controlgroup thing
[05:58:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Can do.
[05:58:38] <arschmitz> it would be nice if we could have this green and on ui-1-12 proper today
[06:00:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Fffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu! There's a sizzle syntax error with core 1.8.3, but only in phantomjs!
[06:01:21] <arschmitz> hmmm 
[06:01:35] <arschmitz> must be a bad or missing escape somewhere that is specific for somereason
[06:01:57] <arschmitz> probably a bug in either sizzle that got fixed
[06:02:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, likely, because there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the string: input[type='checkbox']:not([data-nstest-role='flipswitch']), input[type='radio'], [data-nstest-role='checkboxradio']
[06:02:50] <travis-ci> jquery/jquery-mobile#2290 (ui-1-12-tests - 7442a5a : Gabriel Schulhof): The build failed.
[06:02:50] <travis-ci> Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/7e1185761bc7...7442a5a4c3ac
[06:02:50] <travis-ci> Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/48341665
[06:03:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Looks like it's in autoinit, when it's trying to use the checkboxradio initSelector.
[06:03:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm have to figure out whats different and work backward
[06:04:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what I'm doing. I'm editing the selector.
[06:04:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also unrelated that selector does not look right
[06:05:45] <arschmitz> did  we ever  actually support  [data-nstest-role='checkboxradio']
[06:06:00] <arschmitz> because it certainly wont work lol
[06:06:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, this is kind of an unspoken issue with all these widgets. Theoretically you can instantiate any widget on any element, and it should make an attempt to work.
[06:06:44] <arschmitz> checkboxradios need to be an input of type checkbox or radio
[06:06:56] <arschmitz> thats not true at all
[06:07:22] <arschmitz> checkboxradio and selectmenu will fail for sure
[06:09:06] <arschmitz> infact new checkboxradio will throw an error telling you it can only be called on an input of type checkbox or radio lol https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1415/files#diff-c2a3d3d638808b3bfcc85ed1e3ac17a3R100
[06:09:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but look at UI. It has implementations of a lot of form widgets requiring absolutely no form elements as a basis. So, I mean, you can turn a <h2> into a slider. I mean, I understand that practically there are limitations, but, especially in mobile, we do not distinguish between drawing the enhancement, and integrating with the native API.
[06:09:42] <arschmitz> a lot meaning slider?
[06:09:49] <arschmitz> thats the only one
[06:09:51] <gabriel_schulhof> selectmenu too.
[06:09:58] <gabriel_schulhof> It actually hides the native widget.
[06:10:13] <arschmitz> right but im pretty sure it can only be called on a select
[06:10:51] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess the only one that really, really, really can't work without the native widget is text input, because implementing it using divs would be insane.
[06:11:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway. This is philosophical. We need to fix those tests :)
[06:11:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and that selector is failing when you start tacking on ,input[type='radio'] for some reason.
[06:11:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its not philosophical at all its about a selector in the lib that i think needs to change
[06:12:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, sure, we can get rid of :jqmData(role='checkboxradio)
[06:12:46] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't think anybody's calling .checkboxradio() on an anchor.
[06:13:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well if they do it will not work would never work and will now throw an error
[06:13:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Or a UL :)
[06:13:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Better yet: $( "hr" ).checkboxradio() :)
[06:14:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, do we even support jQuery 1.8.3?
[06:14:11] <arschmitz> yes
[06:14:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Uh-oh ...
[06:14:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Well then this is an invalid selector (for some reason): input[type='checkbox']:not([data-nstest-role='flipswitch']),input[type='radio']
[06:14:59] <arschmitz> ok
[06:15:27] <gabriel_schulhof> I doubt autoinit mangles it with invalid characters ...
[06:15:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Maybe the -nstest?
[06:15:40] <arschmitz> not sure
[06:15:50] <arschmitz> id ask in #jquery-dev
[06:16:45] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:20:51] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, you flip the order of the operands for , and it's fine.
[06:21:05] <gabriel_schulhof> *shrug*
[06:21:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, so the data-nstest-role="checkboxradio" is gone, and I've flipped the order of the operands to get it to pass.
[06:22:22] <arschmitz> ok

[07:38:24] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: do you have a branch somewhere for Core using grunt-php?
[07:38:39] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I think you said that you tried that once...
[07:38:59] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think i pushed it anywhere but i can i still have it
[07:40:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: actually i did https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery/tree/grunt-php
[07:40:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: but i know there were some tests that failed in phantom when i did this but i think that has since beem fixed
[07:41:47] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and one thing had this been used that was needed was a change upstream to grunt-php to have it not output every single file request straight to stdout to make test output legible
[07:50:18] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15jzaefferer opened pull request #1437: Build: Update QUnit to latest (1.17.1) (06master...06qunit-update) 02http://git.io/bKGaBw
[07:51:18] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: was that stdout issue addressed by now?
[07:51:27] <jzaefferer> or you didn't follow up on that?
[07:51:39] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: is this related to the failing test? https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery/compare/grunt-php#diff-906223e701d5bccc03244d6256ffe083R5
[07:51:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i dont think i followed up since this branch never got any love
[07:52:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes 
[07:52:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: if i recall sleep didnt work as expected in grunt-php it seemed
[07:52:57] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: spinning up php standalone is not quite the same as in apache i found 
[07:54:03] <jzaefferer> okay, that sounds like a problem
[07:54:10] <jzaefferer> what's the purpose of the index.php file?
[07:54:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the task fails without it
[07:54:23] <jzaefferer> btw. I want to use this along with browserstack-runner
[07:54:25] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it needs a start page
[07:54:30] <jzaefferer> okay, weird
[07:54:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i saw your comment in infrastructure
[07:54:49] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: if the initial page 404's the task fails
[07:55:11] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and initial page sets the base url it needs to be there
[08:01:31] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:01:46] <jzaefferer> sounds like that could be addressed with a patch in grunt-php, along with fixing the logging
[08:01:56] <arschmitz> probably
[08:02:08] <jzaefferer> I'm more concerned about the sleep call
[08:02:24] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i had tried to get some help with that from ryanneufeld at one point
[08:02:29] <arschmitz> because i could not figure it out
[08:03:29] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php might help
[08:07:32] <jzaefferer> "PHP applications will stall if a request is blocked."
[08:07:42] <jzaefferer> that might be a problem
[08:07:50] <arschmitz> thats EXACTLY what was happening
[08:07:52] <arschmitz> actually
[08:08:29] <arschmitz> they just stalled when the sleep was there
[08:08:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so not sure how to work around it but thats the issue
[08:09:20] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: how many tests are there that actually need php do you know
[08:09:27] <jzaefferer> nope
[08:09:28] <jzaefferer> no idea
[08:09:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: iv been getting REALLY familiar with connect lately and if its not many i bet i could just convert them almost as easy
[08:09:49] <jzaefferer> looks like the logging comes directly from php, but a grunt wrapper should be able to suppress that
[08:09:57] <arschmitz> ( which i know has been suggested multiple times and no one does it )
[08:10:09] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i already have a fork fixing the output
[08:12:16] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: 25 php files: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/search?l=php&q=php&utf8=%E2%9C%93
[08:12:43] <arschmitz> and most are super simple
[08:14:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: depending on how easy ( or possible ) its going to be to make the sleep work this does not seem that bad
[08:15:14] <arschmitz> i had been hoping grunt php was going to be a basicly dropin replacement
[08:42:28] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I'll give it a try
[08:42:56] <jzaefferer> if I can get back to it sometime soon...
[08:43:40] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ok if sleep seems like a pain im happy to take a stab at converting to node too it seems like it should not be bad
[08:43:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and i dont have any commits on core yet ha ha ha h

[10:27:21] <jzaefferer> alright, that works
[11:31:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Pong!
[11:31:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so iv been thinking about checkboxradio initselector
[11:32:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and i think it should be ONLY data-role="checkboxradio" by default
[11:32:19] <arschmitz> i think we should switch everything to default to data-role only
[11:32:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: chassis once we adopt it will include nice base styles for none js form controls
[11:32:51] <arschmitz> and then we have faster selectors with out all the need for :not()
[11:33:21] <gabriel_schulhof> The :not() selector in this case avoids flipswitches.
[11:33:36] <gabriel_schulhof> But yeah, data-role -only will address that too.
[11:34:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Then you have a natural <input type="checkbox" data-ui-role="checkboxradio">...<input type="checkbox" data-role="flipswitch">
[11:34:31] <gabriel_schulhof> If people wanna add to the initSelector, more power to them.
[11:35:36] <gabriel_schulhof> So we should deprecate those portions of the initSelector which grab by something other than data-ui-role
[11:36:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats what im thinking
[11:37:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll make an issue.
[11:37:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How do we make sure we remember this for the changelog?
[11:37:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Should I file an issue against jquerymobile.com as well?
[11:37:49] <arschmitz> api too probably
