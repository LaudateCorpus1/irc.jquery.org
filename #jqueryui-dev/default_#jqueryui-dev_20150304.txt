[00:04:46] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #679: STILL UNSTABLE in 8 min 45 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/679/
[00:36:46] <M4rius> Hi there, I am very interested in working on the jquery UI interactions rewrite (particularly with the PEP sexiness) and would want try to get one of those precious gsoc spots  :) (ping jzaefferer arschmitz)
[00:41:35] <M4rius> In the hope that there isnâ€™t a horde of other students contending for this project yet, I went ahead with some reading up on PEP. Are there resources (or is there source code) you recommend looking into?
[01:33:21] <jzaefferer> M4rius: I think you're the first to show interest for the interactions rewrite. You should definitely study PEP: https://github.com/jquery/pep and the existing interactions branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/interactions
[01:36:37] <M4rius> Ok sweet. I was just playing around with PEP and will look into the interactions branch. 
[01:39:34] <gauravmittal> jzaefferer: hey, for issue https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/706, only the source of the test is required? For this we only print the filename or even the line number???
[01:40:00] <gauravmittal> jzaefferer: Also do we also print the source of assertions?
[01:41:12] <jzaefferer> gauravmittal: since I filed that issue - as I described, I sometimes want to know the source location of a passing test, that's it.
[01:41:24] <jzaefferer> source location includes file name and line number
[01:41:46] <jzaefferer> we already capture that information, so there's no need to call sourceFromStackTrace()
[01:41:48] <gauravmittal> jzaefferer: ok. Thanks

[06:06:23] <gsoc-interest> hello everyone..I am interested in jquery-mobile project which focuses on switching the library..I am very interested and I have knowledge of javascript dom and oop. I think i am capable of doing that task. It would be great if you can guide me through..
[06:18:57] <gsoc-interest> here i am
[06:19:05] <arthurvr> hey gsoc-interest 
[06:19:38] <gsoc-interest> i am an undergraduate student from Netaji Subhas College Of Technology
[06:20:19] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: well first of all there is our getting started page: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[06:21:55] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: For project-specific questions you will need to talk to arschmitz.
[06:22:49] <gsoc-interest> and where can i contact him because i have red all the guidelines..??
[06:23:45] <sfrisk> He'll probably be around a little later, gsoc-interest
[06:24:09] <sfrisk> however I would suggest checking out the issues on the project you would like to contribute to and becoming familiar with the project
[06:25:07] <gsoc-interest> ohh okay..thanks for your responses..
[06:25:34] <sfrisk> What project were you interested in?
[06:26:54] <arthurvr> sfrisk: the jQM one about switching to pointer events.
[06:28:00] <gsoc-interest> yes exactly that one
[06:52:58] <arschmitz> ah he left already as soon as i get back
[08:31:19] <binora> arschmitz: 
[08:31:22] <binora> ping
[08:35:46] <arschmitz> binora: hi
[08:37:02] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: arschmitz is around atm. If you need him?
[08:37:28] <arschmitz> arthurvr: he pm'ed me
[08:37:33] <arschmitz> arthurvr: thank you
[08:37:49] <binora> arschmitz: I'm particularly interested in the 'the new demo system' project. Would like to discuss with you on codemirror vs 'edit on jsbin' button for the editable demos. 
[08:38:43] <arschmitz> binora: we have a pretty specific way we want this to work 
[08:38:51] <arschmitz> and we are working with the creators of jsbin
[08:39:06] <arschmitz> binora: but this task cannot be worked on yet
[08:39:32] <arschmitz> as we are waiting for some things to be in place that are not yet part of this task
[08:39:44] <binora> arschmitz:  so jsbin creators are yet to expose an api for this  right ? 
[08:39:48] <gsoc-interest> yeah thanks aurthur
[08:40:18] <arschmitz> binora: i believe it is availble in a limited fashion
[08:40:27] <arschmitz> binora: but its not just that
[08:43:37] <binora> arschmitz: ok thanks for the update. 
[08:44:26] <arschmitz> binora: your welcome
[08:45:15] <arschmitz> binora: there has been an overwhelming interest in this task so i'm going to do a more detailed writeup on it later today
[08:49:34] <binora> arschmitz: cool. actually before this, i was in favour of doing it with codemirror. Let's see, how things turn out. Meanwhile, could you point me  where i could hack some code related to this demo project ?
[08:52:35] <arschmitz> binora: the only part that you can work on right now would be the making new or improving current demos part
[08:57:45] <binora> arschmitz:  so maybe one or two composite demos additions as for now ? 
[08:58:13] <binora> as mentioned here ? https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96
[08:58:56] <arschmitz> binora: yes but if you just give me a little while im doing a detailed writeup for this task
[08:59:05] <arschmitz> that will likely answer all your questions
[09:00:12] <binora> arschmitz:  apologies. I'll wait for the writeup. thanks. :)
[09:43:25] <bond007__> hello guys! I am interested in working for `jQuery UI - new demo system` idea under gsoc , I would like to get in touch with the mentors ?

[14:20:34] <Sneh1234> Hi I am new here. Can Anyone help getting me started?
[14:24:31] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI build #1540: UNSTABLE in 13 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI/1540/
[14:24:31] <doesallmagic2> joern.zaefferer: Tests: Reduce timeouts to optimize testsuite runtime
[14:45:26] <gauravmittal> leobalter: hey, can u help me in writing the test for https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/758??
[14:47:33] <leobalter> gauravmittal: I'm finishing the tests and I'll send to your branch, is that ok for you?
[14:48:08] <gauravmittal> leobalter: yes. Thanks
[14:52:19] <leobalter> gauravmittal: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/compare/master...leobalter:Source
[14:55:36] <gauravmittal> leobalter: should i squash all the commits in a single file or just create a PR as it is?
[14:55:48] <gauravmittal> i meant single commit
[14:57:10] <gauravmittal> leobalter: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/762
[15:00:47] <leobalter> You can just bring these commits to your Source branch on #758
[15:01:35] <gauravmittal> leobalter: can u tell me how to do that?? Like should i take the .diff of the code and git apply it on my branch?
[15:02:04] <leobalter> one way: 
[15:02:33] <leobalter> you can add my remote: 
[15:03:00] <leobalter> git remote add leobalter https://github.com/leobalter/qunit.git
[15:03:05] <leobalter> git fetch leobalter
[15:03:17] <leobalter> and than you bring those commits you your branch:
[15:03:33] <leobalter> git merge --ff-only leobalter/Source
[15:04:01] <leobalter> you don't need to squash them for now
[15:04:25] <leobalter> let the squash be the last thing before merging, se we can keep better track of updates
[15:08:22] <gauravmittal> leobalter: done
[15:10:01] <gauravmittal> leobalter: with these changes, it shows the source of the failed test while the assertList is hidden. i.e its toggling opposite to the passed tests
[15:10:12] <gauravmittal> leobalter: is it suppose to be like this?
[15:10:32] <gauravmittal> or do i change that
[15:10:35] <leobalter> I'll give a check on that
[15:17:24] <gauravmittal> leobalter: corrected the toggling
[15:24:46] <leobalter> gauravmittal I need to go, so you can still reach me out on Github. Thanks for the patience on that PR. We're probably good to land it as soon as someone else review it again.
[15:30:59] <gauravmittal> leobalter: thanks for all your help :)
[15:36:20] <Sneh1234> leobalter: Hey i am new here . Can you help getting me started?
[23:03:42] <pulkit> Hi, I just read the ideas page and found this one ' Prototype JavaScript transition module' very interesting'. I have some prior experience with jquery and jquery mobile. Please guide me how to start?
[23:19:36] <atomiomi> Once I used jQuery UI slider, but there wasn't any built-in methods to dispay metrics or tooltip. I found many solutions in the web, but I think it will be cool if slider would support them
