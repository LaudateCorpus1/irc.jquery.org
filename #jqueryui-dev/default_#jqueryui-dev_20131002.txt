[02:17:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! Hey! We don't use hoverDelay anymore ...
[02:17:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[02:17:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see it defined in jquery.mobile.defaults.js but not used anywhere.
[02:17:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true
[02:18:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So we don't need to provide a replacement.
[02:18:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: now we use pseudo classes we can't use it anymore
[02:18:16] <_|Nix|_> Awesome.
[02:18:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: however, I remember a ticket about issue with the active state
[02:18:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for that will still add ui-btn-active class
[02:18:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. We should decide what to document in the global options.
[02:19:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so hoverDelay could be used to fix that
[02:19:59] <uGoMobi> but not sure if it fixes the problem
[02:20:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let me see if I can find that ticket

[02:24:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we didn't deprecate it so I am not sure what to document
[02:29:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: however, we did deprecate buttonMarkup
[02:29:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and hoverDelay was actually part of it
[02:30:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: arschmitz moved it to $.mobile
[02:31:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we're gonna use it, we can document that it has moved.
[02:34:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If we need to use hoverDelay to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6248 then we can use it from $.mobile.
[02:34:03] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6248 by jonathannaguin (2mon 3d ago): Listview items are getting active state during scroll
[02:34:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[02:35:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe we can use vmousecancel to remove the active state.
[02:36:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we don't just want to remove, we want to prevent it being added
[02:38:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but the active state is a good thing, because it provides feedback during the 300ms delay when navigating.
[02:38:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but the issue about that it is added when just scrolling
[02:39:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, yeah, because it is adding during vclick, which is basically touchdown.

[05:08:10] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[05:10:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: He's not in the channel.
[05:10:28] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey. thx.
[05:10:37] <_|Nix|_> frequent: The weather has cleared. The sun has appeared from behind the IRC cloud, which has cleared.
[05:10:43] <frequent> _|Nix|_: the magic of scrolling would have told me...
[05:11:01] <_|Nix|_> frequent: That's the problem with the cloud. A clear sky is actually a bad thing :)
[05:11:10] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ;-)
[05:11:27] <frequent> _|Nix|_: and that's why us cloud-workers are all so pale...
[05:11:33] <_|Nix|_> frequent: :)
[05:11:58] <frequent> _|Nix|_: so...
[05:12:16] <frequent> _|Nix|_: on <a> buttons I don't need any data-foo declared anymore?
[05:12:28] <frequent> because it will be depreciated
[05:12:42] <frequent> (looks at a lot of data-foo)
[05:12:49] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah. They'll work in 1.4, but they'll be ignored in 1.5.
[05:13:10] <_|Nix|_> frequent: <a href="someplace" role="button" class="ui-btn ui-corner-all">Some place</a>
[05:13:15] <frequent> (a lot of data-foo is looking frightfully at my delete-key)
[05:13:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Good.
[05:14:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I think the overall markup is slightly longer than with data-attributes, but the size increase is almost certainly worth the reduction in after-the-fact DOM manips.
[05:14:36] <frequent> _|Nix|_: agree, but now I have both, so...
[05:15:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: arschmitz: wanna give me some quick thoughts on select, before I continue hacking away on it?
[05:15:40] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I'll have a look at your PR.
[05:15:47] <frequent> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I only did the data-enhanced yet
[05:16:06] <frequent>  _|Nix|_: thx
[05:17:01] <frequent> _|Nix|_: the _button() { return $("<div/>");} sure had an aha effect after taking custom-select into consideration :-)
[05:17:27] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks for the PR
[05:17:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Welcome back!
[05:17:54] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah. It's an "extension point".
[05:17:55] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[05:17:58] <frequent> uGoMobi: np
[05:18:17] <_|Nix|_> frequent: My only concern is that it's a little late in the release process. We should merge this for either 1.4.1 or 1.5.0.
[05:18:27] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Otherwise, the PR is totally cool!
[05:18:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[05:18:49] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I have it in my extensions, so you can postpone to 1.6 if you want ;-)
[05:19:06] <uGoMobi> it has to wait until 1.5
[05:19:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: We'll merge it right after release.
[05:19:23] <uGoMobi> we can't do this in a maintenance release
[05:19:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, you're right.
[05:19:51] <frequent> no hurry on my side. I would also try to take a jab at tables and custom-select
[05:20:01] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:20:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: are there any plans to modify custom-select?
[05:20:31] <_|Nix|_> frequent: D000d pre-rendered custom select is gonna be ... whew ... a lot of DOM to get right.
[05:20:38] <uGoMobi> frequent: UI is working on new selectmenu widget
[05:20:50] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, actually, you might wanna hold off on custom select ...
[05:20:57] <frequent> uGoMobi: new = custom select?
[05:21:05] <uGoMobi> so eventually we will use the same
[05:21:11] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes
[05:21:20] <uGoMobi> custom selectmenu
[05:21:21] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I was also reading dialogs being depreciated
[05:21:33] <uGoMobi> the dialog widget
[05:21:35] <frequent> so the custom select always defaults to .... popup?
[05:21:39] <frequent> uGoMobi: oui
[05:21:50] <uGoMobi> dialog is an option in the page widget now
[05:21:56] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[05:22:23] <uGoMobi> the custom select shouldn't use the listview widget anymore
[05:22:39] <uGoMobi> we can build the list in custom selectmenu
[05:22:47] <frequent> uGoMobi: I will also have to come up with a modified custom select = force popup with listview filter
[05:22:51] <uGoMobi> that's something you could look into
[05:22:53] <frequent> sometime soon
[05:23:01] <frequent> ok
[05:23:25] <frequent> (fills his todo list)
[05:23:27] <_|Nix|_> frequent: IINM I have a demo where I make the custom select menu's listview filterable.
[05:23:49] <frequent> IINM  being?
[05:24:29] <frequent> In infinite nano minutes...
[05:24:32] <frequent>  never mind
[05:24:40] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I-f I-'m N-ot M-istaken
[05:24:53] <_|Nix|_> frequent: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/selectmenu-custom-filter/
[05:24:55] <uGoMobi> frequent: but yes, we discussed no longer using a dialog for custom select, only popup and fallback to native selectmenu if the list is too long
[05:25:01] <frequent> _|Nix|_: thx
[05:25:12] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. 
[05:25:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's a minor problem with that. The native select wraps with a div, but the custom select wraps with a <a> ...
[05:25:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We'll have to figure that out.
[05:25:57] <frequent> _|Nix|_: talk about "extension point"...
[05:26:22] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, we'll actually have to reconcile the two, or re-wrap, which would likely be bad.
[05:27:31] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I'll see if I can come up with something
[05:28:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, that is something to look into
[05:29:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure at what point we check if we use popup or dialog now
[05:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: ping

[06:16:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[06:16:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just a bit of a follow up on custom select and dialog discussion earlier
[06:17:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we should be careful encouraging people to work on any of the widget we may replace with ui versions
[06:17:12] <arschmitz> until after we discuss roadmap
[06:17:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ^^
[06:17:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. I told frequent to hold off on custom select.
[06:17:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[06:17:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i saw i was just speaking in general 
[06:18:38] <frequent> arschmitz: morning & good point
[06:18:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: just hate to see people put time into something that wont exist in another version or 2
[06:18:52] <uGoMobi> we should now just focus on getting things ready for 1.4 final
[06:19:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're right to make this clear. When talking to frequent, I was pretty much just following my gut. It's good that we've established this.
[06:19:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: completely agreed 
[06:19:15] <uGoMobi> and then discuss roadmap before we do anything for 1.5
[06:19:21] <arschmitz> yup
[06:19:40] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... we already have so much on our plate for 1.5. ... whew ...
[06:19:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe we dont have ANYTHING on our plate for 1.5 yet :)
[06:20:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't know yet
[06:20:14] <arschmitz> im sure we all have things we would like to do but until we make a road map
[06:20:15] <_|Nix|_> OK, for > 1.4.
[06:20:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to make a roadmap first :)
[06:20:23] <uGoMobi> right
[06:21:00] <_|Nix|_> Many moons ago we were talking about tackling scrolling regions. Now this seems to far away.
[06:21:19] <_|Nix|_> s/to/so/
[06:21:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: problem is the browsers still dont have good enough supprt for this to work really
[06:21:40] <arschmitz> and for ones that do its as simple as a single css prop to make it work
[06:21:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Our work here is done.
[06:21:52] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:22:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you would think lol but look at fixed toolbars
[06:22:16] <arschmitz> thats a single css prop too :)
[06:22:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, eh?

[06:33:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i really didnt think we would have a fix for this for final
[06:34:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: History or no history, back buttons will "just work".

[06:34:28] <arschmitz> lol
[06:35:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was talking to uGoMobi though and we dont think we should try to detect fullscreen mode and turn off hashListening automaticly
[06:35:07] <arschmitz> because it works fine in ios6
[06:35:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird, too ... my mate-terminal recently stopped supporting UTF-8 :(
[06:35:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's cool.
[06:41:17] <_|Nix|_> K, so, like, my UTF-8 should now be BugFree™ :)

[06:51:04] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Hm.. any idea how long "grunt task build not found" has been happening?
[06:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...

[06:51:40] <b-ot> Krinkle: Jörn Zaefferer (1w 4d ago): Build: Remove the build task and it's dependencies. Will bring back testing against minified files later.
[06:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I forgot jzaefferer actually did that already.
[06:52:18] <Krinkle> Command: "npm install; grunt; grunt build"
[06:52:22] <Krinkle> that's what Jenkins does
[06:52:31] <Krinkle> (before pushing to CDN)
[06:52:43] <Krinkle> scp dist/jquery-ui.js  ... etc.
[06:52:47] <Krinkle> what should I change that to?
[06:53:58] <Krinkle> Hm.. there doesn't seem to be a replacement
[06:54:03] <Krinkle> uglify is there still though

[06:57:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: i just found a website talking about problems with ios7 and they point to view.jquerymobile.com as an example
[06:58:17] <uGoMobi> :/
[06:58:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not that we are doing anything wrong
[06:58:36] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:58:38] <arschmitz> it just the bug needs a fixed bottom toolbar
[06:58:46] <arschmitz> and we have that in some demos 
[06:58:49] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#904 (master - 39c0313 : Alexander Schmitz): The build passed.

[06:58:50] <arschmitz> so they linked to it
[06:58:53] <uGoMobi> right
[06:59:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a LOT of more broken stuff that is going to be a pain
[06:59:41] <arschmitz> apparently fixed bottom toolbars dont work at all in fullscreen mode
[06:59:47] <arschmitz> they are non interactive
[07:06:23] <frequent> arschmitz: you mean this one: http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios7-html5-problems-apis-review
[07:06:37] <arschmitz> frequent: yes
[07:06:47] <frequent> arschmitz: "nice" list of things.
[07:07:08] <arschmitz> yeah there is some pretty broken stuff i hope they fix
[07:07:26] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/Krinkle/5333379c46679ca01136
[07:07:33] <frequent> I like webkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged
[07:07:47] <Krinkle> Looks like we might be using the wrong version of grunt-css and grunt-junit, or perhaps they don't have newer versions yet?
[07:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I believe both of those are jzaefferer's modules.
[07:10:28] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I've commented out the build/cdn in the Jenkins build for now
[07:11:21] <Krinkle> I wonder if onWebkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged as attribute works :P
[07:11:28] <Krinkle> the legacy way, so to speak
[07:11:34] <Krinkle> and the onwebkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged property
[07:12:09] <Krinkle> prolly not
[07:12:45] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: *doh*, sorry, I screwed up with the changing of '' to false.
[07:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: `npm install` works fine for me. No warnings about those modules.
[07:12:56] <Krinkle> job name "Commit 647b839c52false"
[07:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll fix it.
[07:13:20] <Krinkle> thx
[07:13:38] <Krinkle> we unconditionally add it to the jobname, I didn't see that
[07:13:43] <Krinkle> because on top it is conditional
[07:14:23] <Krinkle> 1.9-stable is fine

[07:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, the build thing too.
[07:41:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could just be me, but it seems like we have the icon on the right a lot more often than we have it on the left. Might be time to change the default.
[07:41:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if there's ui-icon-???? and no ui-btn-icon-????, then it should be on the left.
[07:42:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in 1.5 there is no default anymore
[07:42:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because you have to add the classes yourself
[07:42:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So what if you don't add an iconpos class at all? Does it look bad?
[07:42:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is for buttons that used buttonMarkup
[07:43:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you don't add an iconpos class you don't get to see the icon
[07:43:44] <doesallmagic2> Yippie, build fixed!

[07:44:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Cool. Got it.
[07:44:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[07:44:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because I used the 5 iconpos classes as selector for the base rules for icons
[07:44:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: otherwise I had to use all 50 icons in the selector
[07:45:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right. Ugh!
[07:45:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what you dont like page long selectors????
[07:45:46] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:45:58] <_|Nix|_> Well ... huh ... *blush* ... actually ... I kinda ... y'know ... heh ...
[07:46:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you would!

[07:46:30] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6548 by uGoMobi (5h 25m ago): Checkboxradio on and off classes

[07:46:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was actually looking at that right this moment
[07:46:53] <arschmitz> the PR that is
[07:47:09] <uGoMobi> cool
[07:47:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am updating toolbar demo pages, including data-role="button" stuff in there
[07:48:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it looks good to me
[07:48:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm running my editor in a shell loop, so I can't guarantee that I'll omit the toolbar stuff. I can wait for you to push the toolbar demo fixes, and then I'll fix the conflicts before I push my stuff.
[07:48:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm working in glorified monkey mode. Mostly Ctrl+F,Ctrl+V,Ctrl+G ...
[07:49:05] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:49:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My shoulderblade has already cramped up.
[07:49:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think a change like this is ok after beta?
[07:49:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can imagine
[07:49:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes it fixes a bug and does not change the api 
[07:49:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I consider it a bug that we add icon classes for icons that don't exist
[07:50:43] <uGoMobi> it's just that if you were override a checkbox style you might have to change the selector now
[07:50:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and they dont work right in custom select and this fixes that right?
[07:51:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats not something thats even documented so i think it fine
[07:51:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually I fixed that already on master, but in a bit ugly way
[07:51:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i looked up rules for alpha / beta etc with semvar recently
[07:51:31] <arschmitz> and there basicly are none lol
[07:51:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh ok :)
[07:52:01] <arschmitz> its mostly about point patch and major releases
[07:52:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but in general after beta should only be bug fixes
[07:52:25] <arschmitz> and really nothing after RC
[07:52:32] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:53:07] <uGoMobi> I will run all test just to be sure
[07:53:18] <uGoMobi> only ran checkboxradio and selectmenu tests
[07:53:34] <uGoMobi> and tested with the pages in the demos

[08:04:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: so we didn't consider the jenkins build when removing that; I can just revert that commit

[08:38:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't quite agree that we should set it to false. this._loadMsg always holds a timer ID, which is an integer.
[08:38:26] <doesallmagic2> joern.zaefferer: Day TH's: scope=col. Closes gh-1074
[08:38:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And a timer id of zero means that there's no outstanding timer.
[08:39:04] <arschmitz> oh yeah i was thinking its a true false thing 
[08:39:10] <arschmitz> but its not so that fine
[08:39:22] <arschmitz> i was looking at the diff not thinking
[08:39:36] <arschmitz> so yeah just squash the commits and your good then
[08:40:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: As for the squashing, I'm also hesitant to do that, because the way the commits are now is that they each do one thing that's independent of the other commits. So, for example, if we choose to later revert the separation of the event triggers, we should not also lose the cleaner timeout manipulation.
[08:41:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Same thing with the demos. You can turn off the two-second delay with a simple revert.
[08:41:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I'm not adamant about merging as-is, either.
[08:42:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah the two demos ones are the ones i was thinking about
[08:42:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll squash the demo ones.

[08:52:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: Ping!
[08:52:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[08:53:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[08:53:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so been looking into the page being removed on same page transition
[08:53:35] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:53:42] <arschmitz> this is because in the pagecontainer widget we call a function in the page widget that makes the page remove it self on pagehide
[08:54:00] <arschmitz> this seems like it should be in pagecontainer really but thats a story for another day
[08:54:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez Krinkle|detached: we only upload non-minfied files to the CDN as part of the build, so all we need to run is "concat", which I didn't delete
[08:54:31] <arschmitz> so this simple solution to this is that if from page and to page are the same page dont trigger pagehide
[08:54:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That whole part of the page lifecycle needs cleaning up.
[08:54:34] <jzaefferer> I'll just change the job to do that
[08:54:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i agree but thats for later
[08:54:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure!
[08:55:14] <arschmitz> so basicly if allowsamepagetransiton is true and they are the same page dont ever trigger pagehide
[08:55:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: don't people need the pagehide event to dynamically inject new content
[08:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Sounds good.
[08:55:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you're gonna special-case at that point, why don't you special case the attaching of the pagehide.remove?
[08:55:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cant
[08:56:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dont know yet at that point
[08:56:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that is done when the page is enhanced
[08:56:25] <arschmitz> but you dont know if your going to do a same page transition until some one clicks a link
[08:56:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I also have to adjust the unit test for the z-index stuff, as usual testing for absolute dimensions is a bad idea...
[08:56:31] <arschmitz> or change is called by someone
[08:56:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, and at that point it's already attached.
[08:56:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you transition to the same page I suppose you want to change something on that page first
[08:56:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right
[08:56:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, can it not be detached? It has a unique name.
[08:57:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but then you need to reattach it too
[08:57:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and pagehide seems like good event to bind to for that
[08:57:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, definitely.
[08:57:46] <arschmitz> because if they then go to a different page it needs to be removed
[08:58:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about the pagehide.remove handler. Can it be told after the fact that it's a same page transition? Then it just fires, but bails.
[08:58:12] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://code.jquery.com/ui/ links to http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.csss - where can I fix that? https://github.com/jquery/code.jquery.com doesn't exist
[08:58:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and becomes reattached by the normal page change process.
[08:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: codeorigin.jquery.com
[08:58:51] <jzaefferer> also links to http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-1-9-git.js - which doesn't exist either
[08:59:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the attaching happens when it is injected into the dom
[08:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's supposed to exist. It used to.
[08:59:24] <arschmitz> so it would need some sort of special handling to do a special re-attach
[08:59:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but i guess we could pass an extra param to the pagehide event
[09:00:03] <arschmitz> and then change the page widget to check this and just do nothing if its there
[09:00:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[09:02:41] <_|Nix|_> OK. I think I'm'na take a break. I'm still w00zy from that enormous vgrep. BBL!
[09:03:55] <frequent> arschmitz: there should still be a PR somewhere showing how I allowed same page transitions pre-...1.4. Not sure if helpful, but it was not much to change
[09:04:53] <arschmitz> frequent: id be interested to look at that it wouldnt still work directly because of pagecontainer but might give me a good idea

[11:00:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll look at it in a bit.
[11:27:23] <lonejack> I hope not to bore you with my request for help but I just can not understand some things about the Property as is the UI library. I have created for this purpose a simple pastebin about the point on which I'm having trouble understanding: http://jsfiddle.net/n4NCE/.
[11:27:33] <lonejack> I can not understand one thing: we are extending jquery with the new "focus", whose argument is the function itself "focus". Why is done in this way? It was the only method? Sorry to bother you but I'm trying to understand. thanks
[11:29:31] <lonejack> oh, I'm talking about the file: jquery.ui.core.js at line 49, version: "1.10.3",
[11:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> lonejack: That's how we proxy existing methods. You need to look more carefully at what's happening there. The function is being invoked immediately and returning a new function, which is what gets assigned to $.fn.focus.
[12:12:47] <lonejack> scott_gonzalez, thank you
[12:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> lonejack: Let me know if it's still confusing. I can write out the function another way which might help.
[12:18:56] <lonejack> scott_gonzalez, You did enough. the problem is that although I have read books on Javascript, sometimes, I find very unusual syntax.
[12:19:18] <lonejack> thank you

[14:58:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[15:00:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[15:02:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Do we really need [data-role='page'] selectors in the CSS?
[15:02:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: css/structure/jquery.mobile.core.css:40 and css/structure/jquery.mobile.core.css:41
[15:03:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we do
[15:03:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just curious ... I found the documentation about namespacing saying that you need to update the CSS manually if you use namespacing.
[15:03:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I know
[15:03:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it also says in the theme CSS while it is in the structure CSS
[15:04:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why, though? Pages that don't have ui-page are not visible.
[15:04:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So it doesn't matter how they're sized.
[15:04:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wasn't there a comment in the CSS? lemme check
[15:05:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: "one should always be in view post-pageload"
[15:05:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suppose that was the reason we used the data- attribute selector
[15:06:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, because we add the class ui-page with JS.
[15:06:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So this is for the C-grade case.
[15:08:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't have " in the selector... [data-role=page] instead of [data-role="page"]
[15:09:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wonder if that is working
[15:17:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No idea.
