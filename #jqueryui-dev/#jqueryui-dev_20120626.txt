[04:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Only a little. It's not high priority at all.
[05:04:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez ok, i'll look at them if i get a chance but figured other things were more important right now
[06:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> OMG! CTRL+F2!!!!!!
[06:28:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez ???
[06:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> Moves focus to the menu!
[06:28:58] <kborchers> maybe i missed something. what menu?
[06:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> The OS X menubar.
[06:29:26] <nacin> that's pretty neat.
[06:31:37] <kborchers> doesn't seem to work for me
[06:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Maybe ctrl+fn+f2 for you?
[06:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> I have F-keys set as standard function keys, which I don't think is the default.
[06:35:52] <kborchers> yeah, that worked … i think i'll stick with the mouse :P
[06:36:29] <kborchers> or the command key since most of the menu items i use i know the command+ shortcuts
[06:39:49] <kborchers> rworth see my comment on https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/7
[06:39:50] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #7 on api.jqueryui.com (jzaefferer; 2w, 5d ago): Allow (custom) examples for <option> elements
[06:49:51] <rworth> kborchers we shouldn't need an examples element to have multiple example s
[06:50:34] <rworth> I don't think
[06:53:11] <kborchers> rworth oh, right
[06:53:29] <kborchers> ok, i'll put in the loop for multiple example items.
[06:54:59] <rworth> is a loop needed? Won't a template do?
[06:55:41] <kborchers> rworth i would actually prefer a template but i saw a number of loops in there and thought i should go that route. i'll use a template
[06:56:24] <rworth> we should use loops when we need them, but not if we can avoid it
[06:57:35] <kborchers> this is why i suggested a loop but i could probably refactor this to use the same template as the one i create for the option examples https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L165
[07:09:36] <rworth> kborchers go ahead and do the loop and let's move on. We can refactor later
[07:09:43] <rworth> and for now it is consistent and not terrible
[07:10:03] <kborchers> rworth honestly, i almost done refactoring :)
[07:10:09] <rworth> oh fine!
[07:10:12] <rworth> :)
[07:10:49] <kborchers> rworth i am a bit confused here https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L167
[07:10:50] <rworth> fyi, had a great meeting with the designers, made a plan to get the rest of the designs and implementations done in the next 2 days
[07:10:58] <rworth> sorry, 3 days
[07:11:04] <rworth> today, Wed, and Thu
[07:11:05] <kborchers> was that supposed to put the number after Example: ?
[07:11:38] <kborchers> oh i get it now
[07:11:42] <kborchers> nevermind
[07:12:29] <rworth> and it is clear the blog consolidation won't fit in this week. But it also doesn't need to. Worst case scenario we deploy a new blog theme on current blog sites without changing infra. Best case scenario we do the blog post content import into new repos and launch on the new server, but we won't change any blog urls for now
[07:12:48] * rworth will be back in about 3 hours
[07:35:04] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] kborchers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/PFYZuA
[07:35:04] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] entries2html: Refactor examples to use a template and add example handling for options. Fixes #7 - kborchers
[07:37:36] <kborchers> github down for anyone else?
[07:37:40] <kborchers> ?down github.com
[07:37:43] <bot-t> kborchers, It's just you. - http://github.com is up.
[07:37:46] <kborchers> hmmm
[07:40:35] <rworth> kborchers can you look at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/32 today or tomorrow?
[07:40:35] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #32 on api.jquery.com (scottgonzalez; 3w, 6d ago): .show(), .fadeIn(), etc. missing object signature
[07:42:18] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I thought I dealt with that already.
[07:42:21] <kswedberg> lemme check
[07:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I remember having a lond discussion about it :-)
[07:44:29] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, they're all done, eg: http://stage.api.jquery.com/2012/06/24/fadeIn/
[07:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[07:44:58] <kswedberg> weird. not sure why that url is showing year/month/date/
[07:45:59] <kswedberg> and the options should be indented, but that's a css issue. were we hiring those guys to do the css?
[07:46:24] <kborchers> kswedberg rworth so i don't need to look at that issue, correct? ^
[07:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> The indentation in the code block is whacky.
[07:46:43] <kswedberg> kborchers: right. Imma gonna close it
[07:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> I assume the code samples in the XML were indented based on the actual XML indententation.
[07:46:47] <kborchers> cool
[07:47:28] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I bet it's the result of riding xmltidy on it or whatever
[07:49:32] <kswedberg> kborchers: if you want to take a look at it, please do. Here's the commit: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/commit/9a01a8d597a587308e319500c38593970eb9f362
[07:49:33] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on api.jquery.com by Karl Swedberg (1w, 1d ago): Make xslt handle options better. Still needs work.
[07:49:51] <kswedberg> Not sure anymore why I said it still needs work. Silly me.
[08:11:57] <rworth> kswedberg so, should we close it? Or did you want to figure out what you were thinking?
[08:12:55] <kswedberg> rworth. let's just close it, I guess. if it's working fine. if you want to take a quick look, by all means go for it. I think it was just sloppy and thought maybe it could use templates more effectively. but it's getting the job done.
[08:18:01] <kborchers> kswedberg yeah, my only feedback would be it could be cleaned up to use templates but it can wait. it seems to work fine for now
[08:18:52] <kborchers> i very rarely use loops in XSL
[08:19:03] <kborchers> MOAR TEMPLATES :)
[08:29:25] <kswedberg> :)
[08:29:33] <kswedberg> ok. thx kborchers
[10:20:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: at least I got some bob marley hold music
[10:20:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ;)
[10:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:37:47] <gnarf> this was like my favorite song when I was 4
[10:38:17] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtPk5IUbdH0
[10:38:26] <gnarf> I like this (mt) hold music at least
[10:38:38] <gnarf> shutup "caller #2" lady... I'm jammin to Eddy Grant
[11:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> So gnarf, are we doing init.d or forever (or both)?
[11:08:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: init.d to start forever
[11:08:52] <gnarf> start / stop / restart forever
[11:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:09:16] <gnarf> and status is useful once you have the others :)
[11:09:32] <gnarf> i gotta walk out the door, bbiab
[11:23:20] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/AzYBIA
[11:23:20] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Update grunt-wordpress to 1.0.1 - Jörn Zaefferer
[12:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What signal should I listen for to signal that we want to kill everything? SIGINT?
[14:22:31] <gnarf> oops - left myself on irc @ home - did i miss anything?
[14:23:49] <clarkbox> gnarl, heres the only line you missed since your last message:
[14:23:51] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez: [12:54:04] gnarf: What signal should I listen for to signal that we want to kill everything? SIGINT?
[14:23:59] <clarkbox> gnarf*
[14:25:40] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: any signal would work - HUP is usually a "restart yourself" signal - INT is usually "shut down cleanly" so yes - SIGINT makes the most sense
[15:11:18] <gnarf> nacin|away: damn
[15:11:30] <gnarf> was seriously just typing "hey nacin" and then that happened :/
[17:36:23] <nacin> gnarf: howdy
[17:36:43] <nacin> gnarf: I saw a note about microcaching enabled. I can check it out tomorrow
[17:37:13] <gnarf> working on it now actually
[17:40:11] <gnarf> nacin
[17:40:17] <gnarf> if you're still here
[17:40:38] <gnarf> do you have the definition for microcache_fpm -- Restarting nginx: nginx: [emerg] "fastcgi_cache" zone "microcache_fpm" is unknown in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:33
[17:48:52] <gnarf> found it
[17:48:54] <gnarf> :)
[18:39:59] <kswedberg> rworth: yt?
[18:40:08] <rworth> kswedberg hey
[18:40:40] <kswedberg> hey man. I noticed Jörn is still running into problems with category descriptions in api.jqueryui.com.
[18:41:02] <rworth> hmm. I thought nacin fixed that?
[18:41:13] <kswedberg> Well, he fixed his part. :)
[18:41:40] <kswedberg> I just updated a line in cat2tax.xsl: <description><xsl:copy-of select="desc/text()|desc/*"/></description>
[18:42:11] <kswedberg> but now it's outputting it as a json string.
[18:42:39] <kswedberg> do you remember how you got it to avoid that in api.jquery.com?
[18:44:08] <kswedberg> rworth: ↑
[18:47:49] <rworth> umm
[18:48:20] <rworth> did you bring in xml2json? kswedberg
[18:48:41] <kswedberg> bring it in where?
[18:49:00] <rworth> did you import it
[18:50:03] <kswedberg> no.
[18:51:39] <kswedberg> I basically just made cat2tax.xsl look the same on api.jqueryui.com as it does on api.jquery.com by changing the one line. that's it.
[18:53:34] <kswedberg> rworth: before the change, it did the tag stripping thing. after the change it output it as json string.
[18:53:49] <kswedberg> e.g. "description":{"p":"Effects include extensions to jQuery's built- … "}
[18:54:20] <kswedberg> rworth: I know we just dealt with this in api.jquery.com, but I don't remember what was done.
[18:55:33] <kswedberg> rworth: wait
[18:56:10] <kswedberg> now I remember!  any of the cat descriptions with nested nodes need to be wrapped in cdata. I'll get right on it.
[18:57:17] <rworth> :)

[19:19:13] <kswedberg> rworth: any progress on the xslt for the api.jquery.com jsonp / xml ?
[19:20:14] <rworth> unfortunately none today
[19:37:41] <kborchers> rworth: hey do you know if anyone is working on https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/2 other than the one bit Jörn did? If not, i could try to tackle a bunch of that on the plane tomorrow. Just don't want to duplicate effort
[19:37:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on api.jqueryui.com (jzaefferer; 2w, 6d ago): Review interactions docs
[19:38:30] <rworth> kborchers that's what I was saying you should do. I did it for droppable
[19:38:50] <rworth> that would be great
[19:39:45] <kborchers> rworth: gotcha .. sorry been crazy. just had my work for the past month or so culminate at the JBoss World keynote today so been kind of all over the place.
[19:40:02] <kborchers> i'll dig into that tomorrow
[19:40:10] <rworth> oh yeah, and you couldn't even be there?
[19:40:15] <kborchers> right :/
[19:40:23] <kborchers> travel budget restrictions
[19:40:29] <rworth> bummer
[19:40:47] <kborchers> it was crazy stressful knowing that something i built was being presented and i had no idea how it was going
[19:40:58] <kborchers> got an e-mail saying it went really well so that was good
