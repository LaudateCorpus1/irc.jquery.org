[03:40:27] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Rewrite popup/menu interaction to make popup managed by menu (adds trigger option to menu). Makes popup agnostic of menu and allows datepicker to use popup (soon). - Hans Hillen
[03:40:27] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jquery/jquery-ui - Jörn Zaefferer

[03:41:04] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/datepicker] Datepicker: Rewrite datepicker to use managed popup widget.

[03:48:28] <jzaefferer> ?tell kborchers please take a look at the menu and popup updates - having popup agnostic of menu or other widgets is intended, but the API and implementation may not be optimal
[04:22:48] <lnostdal_> hi, it seems way hard to programmatically show a tooltip at the moment ..   before, i could assign a  content option then call .tooltip('show'), then tooltip('destroy') when done .. but that seems to have changed
[04:38:01] <lnostdal_> oh, i need to actually set the title attribute (even though i never use that), then use .tooltip('open')
[05:08:08] <jzaefferer> or use the items option
[05:08:34] <jzaefferer> see http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/tooltip/delegation-mixbag.html

[05:49:25] <WalterTamboer> Hello
[05:49:47] <WalterTamboer> Is there an proposal system for jQuery UI? I would like to see context menu's integrated into jQuery UI for example. Can I write a proposal for this?
[05:50:13] <jzaefferer> WalterTamboer: usually there's an existing wiki page
[05:50:30] <jzaefferer> if there isn't, we probably don't want to add it
[05:50:39] <jzaefferer> but a forum post is a good start
[05:50:55] <jzaefferer> check http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/36727309/FullList
[05:51:02] <WalterTamboer> Thanks a lot!
[05:51:17] <jzaefferer> as for contextmenu in particular, that should be mostly covered by menu already
[05:51:19] <WalterTamboer> What are the criteria for UI widgets actually?
[05:51:27] <jzaefferer> just add a right click handler?
[05:52:02] <WalterTamboer> No what I mean is what is filtered on? What is likely to become a widget and what is not?
[05:52:25] <jzaefferer> if its on the roadmap, we're gonna work on it, if its on the list, we're gonna work on it eventually
[05:52:28] <jzaefferer> otherwise, depends
[05:52:40] <jzaefferer> documenting something like that is more effort then its worth
[05:54:04] <WalterTamboer> I see.
[05:54:49] <jzaefferer> as for contextmenu, check out Menu: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Menu
[05:55:14] <jzaefferer> in particular: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menu/contextmenu.html
[05:56:45] <WalterTamboer> Thanks jzaefferer. Can't wait till the upcoming releases.
[06:14:57] <jzaefferer> I hope you actually can, it'll still take some time :-)
[06:15:03] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers
[06:15:14] <kborchers> hey
[06:15:35] <jzaefferer> looks like bot-t is gone :(
[06:15:54] <jzaefferer> gonna ?tell you myself
[06:15:55] <jzaefferer> nice commit message: http://bassistance.de/i/e183b9.png
[06:16:07] <jzaefferer> also
[06:16:08] <jzaefferer> please take a look at the menu and popup updates - having popup agnostic of menu or other widgets is intended, but the API and implementation may not be optimal
[06:16:48] <kborchers> what the heck happened to my commit message???
[06:17:27] <kborchers> that's weird
[06:17:49] <jzaefferer> haha
[06:18:03] <jzaefferer> practical joke :p
[06:18:19] <jzaefferer> you know how you can edit anything in a website within your browser?
[06:18:51] <jzaefferer> github's silly … … line breaking just lend itself to do that
[06:19:41] <jzaefferer> kborchers?
[06:19:56] <jzaefferer> no need to rewrite history
[06:19:58] <kborchers> ooohhhh ... i was like, that's not what my local repo says so i checked github and saw it wasn't changed there either :)
[06:23:22] <lnostdal_> jzaefferer, oh, thank you :)
[06:44:24] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i think those changes make sense though I see what you're saying about API
[06:45:15] <kborchers> i wonder if this should be applied to menubar as well to allow the top level buttons to act as the triggers for the menus and open them as popups
[06:46:09] <kborchers> i'm actually in the process of making changes to menubar to eliminate the dependece on UL/LI structure like I did for menu
[06:47:04] <kborchers> also, i made some this,that, _delay comments in his commit
[06:57:06] <jzaefferer> ah, just saw those
[06:57:10] <jzaefferer> freel free to just fix em
[06:59:49] <kborchers> ok
[08:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> menu has a failing test
[08:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> looks like maybe an option was added or changed
[08:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> but tests weren't updated
[08:10:51] <kborchers> yep, hans added the trigger option for use with popup. I'm cleaning up his that/this stuff right now so I'll fix that while i'm in there

[10:49:54] <jzaefferer> jslint would disagree on multiple levels...
[10:50:10] <gnarf> heh
[10:50:16] <gnarf> yeah, hasOwnProperty fail
[10:50:24] <gnarf> but we don't support that right?
[10:50:28] <gnarf> $.
[10:50:34] <gnarf> does $.each hasOwnProperty ?
[10:51:46] <gnarf> so like
[10:51:49] <gnarf> ant is pissing me off
[10:51:59] <gnarf> it is killing off processes before they flush their output buffers or something

[12:23:55] <kborchers> we'll know if something is wrong if you start writing jaqueries
[12:28:37] <ajpiano> can anyone enlighten me as to what is going on with themeroller at the moment
[12:28:52] <ajpiano> felix geisendorfer isis working on it right?
[12:29:08] <gnarf> ajpiano: I don't think we are doing anything with TR atm?
[12:29:13] <gnarf> i know mobile is...
[12:29:37] * gnarf looks through old meeting notes for
[12:29:41] <ajpiano> that's what i'm trying to figure out, is what is our plan
[12:29:50] <ajpiano> to use the mobile stuff, or is there something happening with felix :)
[12:30:03] <ajpiano> or is it a combination

[12:30:22] <gnarf> "They're going to build and host the downloadbuilder, with the actual build able to replace our current ant built. They may also tackle Themeroller, but DB first."
[12:30:26] <gnarf> (nodejitsu)
[12:30:56] <ajpiano> interesting
[12:31:25] <gnarf> other than that
[12:31:34] <gnarf> no notes in the last um - 4 months of meetings?
[12:38:28] <gnarf> oh hey scott_gonzalez - can you ping nodejitsu and point them at my conversion to uglify?
[12:38:45] <gnarf> just to make sure they are on the top of that branch when they work and don't bother with closure?
[12:55:04] <kswedberg1> Nice: "I should note that the larger and more complicated a web app the less
[12:55:04] <kswedberg1> likely it is to use jQuery from what I've seen…."
[12:55:13] <kswedberg1> what the heck does that have to do with the qsa discussion?
[12:56:45] <kswedberg1> ^^ quote from Boris in that thread. Makes no sense to me how that could possibly contribute to the discussion.
[13:04:29] <gnarf> kswedberg1: wrong channel?
[13:04:55] <kswedberg1> gnarf: woops. yep!
[13:50:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: btw
[13:50:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i found a use case where implicitly doing the setTimeout on deferreds would suck
[13:51:33] <gnarf> when working on this todo app demo, i actually want syncro behavior between the .resolve and the doneCallbacks being fired immediately
[13:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[13:53:49] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/59d4a9fb9e969a56354b
[13:53:53] <gnarf> although interestingly enough
[13:54:05] <gnarf> if it was doing an implicit setTimeout(...,0) i could abuse that
[13:54:07] <gnarf> but
[13:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> afterChanges doesn't sound like a good use of deferreds
[13:54:43] <gnarf> like declaration wise, this code makes a lot of sense, and adding yet another setTimeout(...,0) would introduce more delay not needed
[13:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> sounds like an event
[13:55:06] <gnarf> i suppose we could handle it that way too
[13:55:22] <gnarf> $.Callbacks just makes too much sense here tho
[13:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> well, $.Callbacks doesn't need to be async for $.Deferred to be async
[13:57:06] <gnarf> true
[13:57:26] <gnarf> $.Callbacks("unique once memory")
[13:57:36] <gnarf> is better there than a deferred
[13:57:45] <gnarf> also makes it so that the function will only ever be added once
