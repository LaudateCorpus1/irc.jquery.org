[02:25:24] <Alec> am working with jQuery sortable feature
[02:26:02] <Alec> and need to a little form in the li 
[02:26:19] <Alec> however, the form elements appear disabled
[02:26:22] <Alec> I can't type in them
[02:26:54] <Alec> <li id="valItem-email_validator" class="">Is Email									<div onclick="showValidatorSettings($(this))" style="float:right;cursor:pointer;">+</div><div style="clear:right;"></div> 									<div class="validatorSettings"><table> 										<tbody><tr> 											<td>Message</td> 											<td><textarea name="validationMessage" type="text" class="validationSettingsField"></textarea></td> 										</tr> 									</tbody></table></di
[02:27:09] <Alec> the textarea is not editable
[02:38:32] <Alec> ok, this is a solution thats not perfect but works
[02:38:49] <Alec> on the textarea do onclick="$(this).focus();"

[04:14:41] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: about that inline option - would be great if you could write down the usecase and requirements and what not and put it up on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker

[06:04:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Hi
[06:05:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Do we have a meeting tonight? Should I join the UI one two hours earlier?
[06:06:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also: I just pushed the branch where I break up custom select somewhat(^).
[06:06:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ui was yesterday
[06:06:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make a PR for it. Please have a look over it when you get a chance.
[06:06:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: will do
[06:06:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right - that's wednesday ...
[06:06:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tests should be green.
[06:06:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not sure about meeting today or not
[06:06:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nice
[06:07:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so i have ui Datepicker, Tabs, Menu, and Spinner all working in mobile
[06:07:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I had to stop short of doing some perf improvements, because I need to make the widget work on its own first.
[06:07:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[06:07:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ui autocomplete too but the css needs a lot of love lol
[06:08:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and all without ui core
[06:08:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I want to test my perf improvements not just individually on jsperf, but also holistically by creating a custom select on an otherwise plainjs page.
[06:08:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[06:08:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and in order to do the latter, I need to have the custom select working outside pages.
[06:08:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah id like to see perf on custom select would be nice to see some imporvment that was one that could use it
[06:08:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: problem with that is select as dialog
[06:09:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://jsperf.com/create-vs-clone-with-params is interesting. That's creating the button.
[06:09:03] <arschmitz> makes that essentially impossible
[06:09:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'm only testing creation.
[06:09:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can test operation with async tests.
[06:09:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: AFAIK jsperf can do async.
[06:09:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just meant its not really possible to actually do custom select outside the page
[06:09:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and if not, we'll have to ramp up our own test suite first and make it work with browserscope.
[06:10:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it should work for small custom selects, because popup works outside the page.
[06:10:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[06:11:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what do you think about taking all the data functions out of mobile core
[06:11:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing is that, if the click handling is not present, custom select has to open by hand.
[06:11:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not bad.
[06:11:28] <arschmitz> like all the jqmdata and getAttribute stuff for dealing with namespace
[06:11:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[06:11:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We'd be pulling in core in fewer places.
[06:11:47] <arschmitz> i think that should be its own module
[06:12:07] <arschmitz> and its like half of core right now
[06:12:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would be nice to be able to exclude it completely if people dont care about namespacing
[06:12:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up with IEMobile 9 in the above jsperf anyway? It prefers creation to cloning! How weird is that?
[06:12:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[06:13:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But then we need to fix all the references to $.mobile.ns to read ( $.mobile.ns || "" ) ... this used to be the norm, and may need to be the norm again.
[06:13:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup it would not be simple
[06:14:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would also have to ensure we dont use jqmData internally
[06:14:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I think I'll go do some shopping and when I get back I'll get on making the custom select work outside the page. Doing the click handling should be ... interesting ...
[06:15:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok talk to you later
[06:15:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we can use jqmData, but then we need to depend on the corresponding module.
[06:15:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, I still feel like we're totally snowed in, despite the respite on pointer events.
[06:15:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but the point would be to exclude the data stuff if people dont care about name space
[06:15:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh we are
[06:15:51] <arschmitz> im starting review on text input
[06:15:56] <arschmitz> or already did rather
[06:16:02] <arschmitz> seems like a good place to start lol
[06:16:11] <_|Nix|_> For sure!
[06:16:55] <arschmitz> we will see if anything needs fixing tomorrow when i get WP8 as far as events
[06:17:02] <arschmitz> but i have my fingers crossed
[06:18:29] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened pull request #6108: Flatten custom select (06master...06flatten-custom-select)  02http://git.io/WJO9eg
[06:18:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Riiiight. 
[06:18:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, there you go ^
[06:19:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Feel free to merge if it's all good.
[06:24:15] <_|Nix|_> OK ... We may just wait until my daughter goes for her afternoon nap before that shopping trip ... now I'm anxiously awaiting the completion of the travis job for the PR :)
[06:37:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yaaaay! PR build is greeeen!
[06:38:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: very cool
[06:47:36] <tabi> hi
[06:47:41] <tabi> every one?
[06:48:05] <tabi> any one knows how jquery tabs use with jquery lightbox?
[06:49:21] <tabi> hello?
[06:53:07] <tj_vantoll> tabi Support is in #jquery.
[07:04:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Check it out: No need for a custom build: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/custom-select.html
[07:05:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hrm ... that should result in a few HTTP requests :)
[07:09:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im confused. thats not enhanced the widget is not running on it when i load that page
[07:11:32] <arschmitz> its like jqm is not running on that page at all actually
[07:13:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: about that datepicker inline option - would be great if you could write down the usecase and requirements and what not and put it up on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker
[07:14:49] <didiergm> arschmitz - reading back what you said, does it means that ui Datepicker, Tabs, Menu, Spinner and possibly autocomplete will be 'officially' available in 1.4 ?
[07:19:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i will do that today
[07:19:14] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: cool, thanks
[07:19:23] <arschmitz> didiergm: tabs will be for sure not sure about others
[07:19:49] <arschmitz> datepicker almost for sure will not be officially supported but we will have demos and i will maintain a repo for the extension for it
[07:20:18] <didiergm> arschmitz autocomplete would be awesome. pretty please ? :)
[07:20:35] <arschmitz> didiergm: im working on it just started on that one last night
[07:21:15] <didiergm> arschmitz. I keep my fingers crossed; whenever the Team needs a tester, feel free to ping me
[07:21:43] <arschmitz> didiergm: good to know thank you the biggest thing for us is to have people test the alpha and beta releases
[07:22:12] <arschmitz> so we can identify problems before final especially alpha 
[07:26:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, that's right. However, the widget, and only the widget is loaded. So, if you run $( "select" ).selectmenu(); it will be enhanced.
[07:26:52] <didiergm> arschmitz Count me in. Last 3 apps I wrote where with JQM and I find it fantastic. I am now doing some pretty slick stuff with it; even on desktops.  I am happy to convert to 1.4 with all the goodies around the corner 
[07:27:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the widget and all its dependencies, which, of course, include dialog, page, and popup.
[07:27:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm at the point where the popup doesn't open and it always wants to do a dialog instead of a popup.
[07:27:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I need to figure out why it always decides in favour of a dialog.
[07:28:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The idea on that page was to show you requirejs in action with minor configuration.
[07:28:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[07:30:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The popup actually works on that page: $( "#select-long-option-label-listbox" ).popup( "open" );
[07:30:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's no theme, so the background is transparent, but I'll leave that to uGoMobi :)
[07:30:39] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[07:30:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and there's a JS error when you close the popup. I'll have a look at that.
[07:32:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You were right in that trying to make custom select work outside pages is gonna be a challenge. I just realized that this involves making /pages/ work ... outside pages.
[07:32:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That is, we need to make a page work in an otherwise plainjs document.
[07:32:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah sorry thats what i was trying to get at
[07:33:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I can try to get it to open as a popup.
[07:33:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually thats exactly what it should do
[07:33:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think making pages work outside pages will be helped by the content widget.
[07:33:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean it should always open as a popup?
[07:33:55] <arschmitz> if its outside a page it should always open as a popup
[07:34:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess that's cool as long as the options are kept to a minimum.
[07:35:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't want to hardcode that just yet. I'll work with small selects where it will naturally choose to show itself as a popup and make that work first.
[07:35:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I may have to depend on the click handler.
[07:35:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when people are using widget outside a page its much harder to make assumptions about things
[07:36:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. I was trying to think about how we'd handle showing a single page in an otherwise unprocessed document.
[07:37:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking: $( "body" ).children().css( "visibility", "hidden" ); and then display the page absolutely at 0, 0.
[07:37:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and stretch it to cover the document.
[07:37:27] <arschmitz> kinda like uGoMobi and i decided that for panels we will only support overlay because it would be too hard to assume what their page structure is to make reveal or push work
[07:37:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's probably the equivalent of an A-bomb :)
[07:38:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess you can't temporarily wrap the whole body in a div, play around with that div, and then unwrap. That would throw all kinds of body > p rules out of whack.
[07:38:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not to mention it'd be a bullet to the head for performance.
[07:39:03] <arschmitz> lol
[07:39:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess if people want that kind of an interaction they still need to buy into our page model.
[07:39:56] <arschmitz> i think there there comes a point where when you leave our nice closed ecosystem of pages you lose some features with it
[07:40:13] <arschmitz> but the core functionality should remain
[07:40:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. You can only go so far.
[07:40:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and custom select is pushing that very boundary, because it uses dialogs.
[07:41:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess if I look at it that way, hard-coding the decision to be in favour of a popup irrespective of the height of the list makes sense.
[07:41:33] <arschmitz> and with custom select i would say the core functionality is the popup action
[07:41:58] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[07:44:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: at that point it might make sense to seperate out dialog functionality into an extension?
[07:45:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and excellent idea.
[07:45:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we have a nice interface between the two: _decideFormat: function()
[07:45:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup modular design all the way lol
[07:46:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oooh! Might improve perf greatly, by saving the init step of creating a dialog.
[07:46:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: very true
[07:46:20] <_|Nix|_> Dang!
[07:47:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We still need to get people to stop using the whole library though.
[07:48:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah actually i was advising someone on #jquery this morning about how they should be doing a custom build for their use case
[07:48:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's really hard to get into that mindset.
[07:48:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good!
[07:48:35] <arschmitz> because all they wanted was style basicly and no nav
[07:49:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should work even with 1.3.1, but they still need page and they need to call changePage manually.
[07:49:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... well, or use http links.
[07:49:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they are not going to do link binding
[07:50:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, I get that, but if they want the smooth page transitions, then they need pages and changePage.
[07:50:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If they're gonna do HTTP page changes then they might still need page, because the widgets don't work outside pages, but they don't need changePage.
[07:50:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Either way though, some serious chunks can be left off.
[07:51:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope that's a trend - where we get people to do custom builds.
[07:51:40] <arschmitz> yeah they dont want transitions either lol
[07:51:56] <arschmitz> just basicly the page and element styles
[07:52:27] <arschmitz> but anyway yeah custom build and some mobileinit settings are the answer
[07:53:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This morning I had my meeting with the Samsung folks, and apparently they're gonna do a whole other framework without jQuery and jQM while re-creating all of the functionality of the existing framework and having much higher performance. I wished them luck, but I added that they might want to do this AMD-izing from the very start, because it needs to be implemented all the way up into the SDK IDE so each app dev can choose the 
[07:53:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[07:54:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah good luck to them
[07:54:07] <arschmitz> talk about reinventing the wheel
[07:54:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, well, whatever. If they have the personnel to spare, they might even do something decent.
[07:54:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: with out jqm i totally understand
[07:54:56] <arschmitz> but with out jquery at all seems like a whole lot of effort
[07:55:10] <_|Nix|_> *shrug*
[07:55:28] <arschmitz> but yeah if they think they can do it and do it well more power too them
[07:55:34] <_|Nix|_> I almost called it bare metal, but then I hesitated :)
[07:55:48] <arschmitz> lol
[07:56:35] <arschmitz> problem with them using jqm is we cant modify it to the extent they would like
[07:56:48] <arschmitz> because of all the devices / browsers we support
[07:56:54] <jquicommit> 01[13jquery-ui01] 15jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/baVO8g

[07:57:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's true, but we could provide some entry points, and with AMD, they might even replace modules. Like, if we were to factor out the data access module, and if core were to factor out theirs, we could really offer a place for a drop-in replacement.
[07:57:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes for sure
[07:58:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, like, WK-specific? Bam! NP!
[07:58:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i think we are moving in that direction but not quick enough for them
[07:58:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... 
[07:59:26] <arschmitz> we dont have the kind of man power samsung does
[08:00:03] <_|Nix|_> That's right.
[08:00:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Again I see inklings of what Angelina was talking about in her talk: We're gonna have multiple providers for a given AMD module and we'll have to juggle cross-library builds and drop-in replacements.
[08:01:18] <arschmitz> sounds fun lol
[08:01:25] <_|Nix|_> Before long we'll have a module ecosystem just as we have an app ecosystem today.
[08:02:06] <arschmitz> would be cool to see
[08:02:21] <_|Nix|_> It will be fun to see us tackling the same issues that Linux distros have tackled many moons ago when they were working on package dependencies.
[08:02:31] <arschmitz> lol

[09:10:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i know have tabs,datepicker,menu,spinner, and working on autocomplete
[09:10:58] <uGoMobi> cool
[09:11:16] <arschmitz> autocomplete is functioning but has no styles at all right now lol
[09:11:59] <uGoMobi> I think we only should do tabs for 1.4
[09:12:15] <uGoMobi> first finishing all other things
[09:13:09] <arschmitz> datepicker should not be part of library at all
[09:13:16] <uGoMobi> right
[09:13:45] <uGoMobi> that's gonna be re-written, right?
[09:14:05] <arschmitz> the others either way they are completely done and working
[09:14:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes and also ui datepicker is not a widget
[09:14:28] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:15:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ui-menu essentially restores nested listviews
[09:15:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but they probably still need unit tests, documentation, etc.
[09:15:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: okay that's something we could look into
[09:15:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: unit tests are all on ui basicly the only tests are to ensure they are being auto initalized
[09:16:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/itixun/3/edit
[09:16:50] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:17:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was just a bit worried that we want too much and we only have like two weeks before alpha release
[09:17:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah im not pushing for one way or the other to be honest
[09:18:04] <arschmitz> im just letting you know the status and how they work 
[09:18:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's just make sure all the things we have been working on is on master and then see if we can add some of those UI widgets
[09:18:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gotcha
[09:19:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW, did you had a chance to add _setOptions to page widget?
[09:19:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ah thanks for reminding me no ill do that today
[09:19:54] <uGoMobi> hmm JS Bin loads a bit slow :(
[09:20:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: unminified files from various places does not help lol
[09:20:19] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:20:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im going to run to lunch see you in a bit
[09:20:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: okay, enjoy lunch

[12:16:35] <arschmitz> agcolom: _|Nix|_: wow i didnt realize 1.2.1 and 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 are all missing of code.jquery.com too
[12:17:24] <arschmitz> already have to update again lol
[12:36:30] <agcolom> arschmitz: yep, there is always something to do :-)
[12:53:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: enjoy your vacation!!
[13:16:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: yikes range slider completely breaks ie9 in 1.3.1
[13:27:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: ok false alarm looks like its just an issue with ie10 in ie9 or ie8 mode actual copies are fine
[13:27:36] <arschmitz> had not noticed i was upgraded 
[15:01:17] <timmywil> Krinkle: I'm trying to create a new project on my testswarm installation. I keep getting an error when setting the password. "stty: invalid argument". any ideas?
[15:10:05] <Krinkle> Hi
[15:10:16] <Krinkle> eh..
[15:35:36] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15maxmayhem opened issue #6109: Text Input hidden via Children will not Show().  02http://git.io/cs-ImA
[15:49:23] <Krinkle> timmywil: You disappeared earlier
[15:49:42] <Krinkle> timmywil: Where do you have this set up. Locally? Apache?
[15:49:49] <Krinkle> Did you finish the installation instructions?
[15:50:10] <Krinkle> Which script is giving that stty error, install? update? manageProject.php?
[16:23:58] <timmywil> Krinkle: manageProject.php. I have an nginx setup on a remote server.
[16:27:01] <timmywil> when creating a new project
[16:29:41] <Krinkle> timmywil: does the web app work correctly? Navigate around a bit.
[16:29:55] <Krinkle> timmywil: what parameters are you giving it
[16:30:00] <timmywil> seems to
[16:30:10] <Krinkle> timmywil: Can you do `php scripts/manageProject.php --help`?
[16:30:19] <Krinkle> (just chekcing how early on the error is triggered)
[16:30:40] <Krinkle> perhaps your ssh/bash set up is funky? I'm not using any non-standard methods afaik. Just plain readline.
[16:31:13] <timmywil> hmm, I'm using zsh
[16:31:14] <Krinkle> So this is likely something between you and the remote server's php and/or readline package?
[16:31:30] <timmywil> dunno if that would be a problem
[16:31:52] <Krinkle> afaik zsh's readline should be compatible (it better darn well be). But you may want to try with bash
[16:34:16] <timmywil> well, it seems the project was created even though there was an error
[16:35:01] <timmywil> I may be ok, maybe it was just something weird with my setup
[16:36:36] <timmywil> Krinkle: thanks btw
[16:36:50] <Krinkle> yw
[16:37:34] <johnbender> Krinkle: I feel like I should know this but is the testswarm setup automated?
[16:37:45] <johnbender> chef/puppet/bash etc
[16:37:46] <johnbender> ?
[16:38:18] <johnbender> timmywil's questions suggest that it is in some fashion
[16:38:50] <johnbender> or is it the step by step on the project README
[16:39:12] <timmywil> johnbender: I did the step by step first (with help from our sys admin)
[16:39:20] <johnbender> cool
[16:39:56] <johnbender> burried deep down in some org mode todo list somewhere on my hardrive was something about porting all that to chef or puppet
[16:40:14] <johnbender> (assuming that it's possible in the first place)
[16:40:27] <johnbender> then vagrant would be free
[16:40:30] <johnbender> "free"
[16:42:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: did you guys do a meeting yesterday or today?
[17:31:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: yes we met today
[17:31:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: it was just _|Nix|_ uGoMobi and i though and anne showed up at the very end

[18:31:12] <arschmitz> but we are joining the ui one for some planning
[18:32:36] <arschmitz> johnbender: at some point id like to talk to you about some ideas for containers while your still around :) future stuff that _|Nix|_ and i discussed in portland and i would like your opinion on
[18:33:17] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#411 (master - 2cd340b : Alexander Schmitz): The build was fixed.
[18:33:17] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/bd30ca985940...2cd340bd9acc
[18:33:17] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/8296922
[20:46:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah ping me tommorrow and I'm happy to discuss
[20:46:21] <arschmitz> johnbender: awesome will do
[20:53:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: or right now since you're online :)
[20:53:27] <JamesMGreene> johnbender: Oh man, just got my sweeeeet (mt) notebook in the mail
[20:53:43] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: YAH! So did I lolol
[20:53:49] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: I'm glad too, I'm stocking up
[20:53:56] <johnbender> been burning through them quickly recently
[20:54:07] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: the shirt is nice quality too at least
[20:54:11] <johnbender> I've been meaning to tweet a thanks
[20:54:19] <JamesMGreene> If you've gotta write your proofs down, why not do it in a classy notebook, right?
[20:54:41] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: precisely
[20:54:54] <johnbender> I can look like a hipster douche while looking like a shut-in nerd
[20:55:02] <johnbender> what more could I ask for
[20:55:14] <JamesMGreene> more notebooks?
[20:55:21] <johnbender> lol
[20:55:22] <johnbender> well played
[20:55:45] <JamesMGreene> So is #jquerymobile-dev being merged into #jquerui-dev?  I thought that'd what I heard in Portland
[20:55:55] <JamesMGreene> *  #jqueryui-dev
[20:55:57] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: already done
[20:56:06] <JamesMGreene> arschmitz: Figured that's why the other was invite only
[20:56:11] <arschmitz> yup
[20:56:19] <JamesMGreene> \m/
[20:56:35] <johnbender> JamesMGreene: yes, we're here to ugly up the place
[20:57:10] <arschmitz> johnbender: hey dont really have time for full containers discussion right now but do want a quick opinion on something 
[20:57:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: totally understandable, happy to chat whenever about whatever :)
[20:57:47] <arschmitz> johnbender: what do you think of removing mobile core
[20:57:52] <arschmitz> and breaking it into 3 modules
[20:58:01] <arschmitz> defaults, helpers, and data
[20:58:14] <arschmitz> data will be all the namespaced data funstions and stuff
[20:58:24] <arschmitz> helpers all the helper functions
[20:58:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: any kind of organization for ore would be good
[20:58:43] <arschmitz> and defaults will be just that the defaults stuff
[20:58:52] <johnbender> and moving those helpers off of the $.fn namespace would be good if possible to avoid stomping external plugins
[20:59:00] <arschmitz> so there would be no jquery.mobile.core 
[20:59:04] <johnbender> yes
[20:59:07] <johnbender> wonderous
[20:59:16] <arschmitz> awesome because i already did it lol
[20:59:19] <johnbender> would be good step toward getting rid of the jquery.mobile.X too
[20:59:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: this is the great thing about modules
[20:59:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i need to do that
[20:59:42] <johnbender> it's just a dependency declaration away
[20:59:48] <arschmitz> yup
[21:00:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool, ping me tomorrow if you get time
[21:00:05] <arschmitz> i figured you would be all for it but thought id get a second oppinion
[21:00:10] <johnbender> word
[21:00:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: i will your normally on around 9am your time right
[21:00:55] <johnbender> yah I should be
[21:01:00] <arschmitz> awesome
[21:01:11] <arschmitz> i just need to get to bed soon lol
[21:11:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: still trying to decide what I'm going to do when my daughter goes to bed tonight (my wife is in NYC)
[21:11:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool
[21:11:17] <johnbender> I'm thinking Star Wars and some futzing with TypeScript
[21:11:29] <arschmitz> could be a good combo
