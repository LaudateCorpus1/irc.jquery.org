[06:56:49] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: I added some new commits to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1017
[06:57:02] <mikesherov_> seems to have addressed almost all of the issues with the effects demo
[06:57:12] <mikesherov_> I haven't tested in IE8 yet though
[07:00:08] <mikesherov_> or maybe scottgonzalez ?
[07:00:35] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, scottgonzalez for now.
[07:00:50] <scottgonzalez> scott_gonzalez is going to ZNC which I'm not connected to right now.
[07:01:09] <mikesherov_> right
[07:01:09] <scottgonzalez> I'll check out the updates.
[07:01:17] <mikesherov_> same with that jerk mikesherov
[07:01:21] <scottgonzalez> heh
[07:01:25] <mikesherov_> I had a question
[07:01:37] <mikesherov_> if I click blind twice quickly
[07:01:46] <mikesherov_> in master, it plays the full animation twice
[07:01:54] <mikesherov_> in my branch, it doesn't
[07:02:10] <mikesherov_> this is because .show and createWrapper are called in master each time
[07:02:18] <mikesherov_> that's desired behavior, right?
[07:02:22] <mikesherov_> scottgonzalez: ^
[07:02:37] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, I think successive calls should queue up.
[07:02:54] <mikesherov_> well, then I think the wrong behavior is happening in both
[07:03:18] <mikesherov_> because in master, it immediately restarts the animation
[07:04:05] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, that seems wrong.
[07:04:26] <scottgonzalez> It should be like .fadeToggle().fadeToggle()
[07:04:43] <mikesherov_> right
[07:05:04] <mikesherov_> so both behaviors are wrong then
[07:05:53] <mikesherov_> scottgonzalez: I have this list for the ones that aren't queueing properly Effects demo: back to back effects aren't queueing properly for: fold, size, scale, drop, clip, blind
[07:06:14] <scottgonzalez> ok
[07:31:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[07:45:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[07:45:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[07:46:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you please check that I'm not talking outta my ass in https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/issues/176#issuecomment-36489155?
[07:46:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am on hotel wifi so I might reply a bit slow :/
[07:47:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[07:47:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, will look at it now
[07:47:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[07:47:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got us a new firefox os phone and hopefully another in a month or 2
[07:47:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[07:47:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh great!
[07:47:50] <arschmitz> all shiny and new even
[07:47:56] <uGoMobi> cool
[07:47:57] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[07:48:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how was the conference?
[07:48:15] <arschmitz> but we owe someone a tweet
[07:48:18] <arschmitz> lol
[07:48:23] <uGoMobi> hehe
[07:48:30] <arschmitz> it was great
[07:48:39] <uGoMobi> I have the pw, but I dont see a FF phone yet ;)
[07:48:40] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:49:28] <arschmitz> do you remember Cory Gackenheimer?
[07:49:46] <arschmitz> he gave a talk about ui and mobile widgets in san diego and i think austin too?
[07:49:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[07:50:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, I spend time with him in San Diego
[07:50:02] <arschmitz> hes trying to get his employer to sponser him for one day a week to work on mobile
[07:50:16] <uGoMobi> I knew he was going to do his talk in Vienna too
[07:50:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh that would be great
[07:50:42] <arschmitz> yeah hes going to let me know when he gets an answer
[07:51:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I already mentioned that he would like to have more time to contribute to open source
[07:51:36] <arschmitz> yeah some hopefully that will work out for him
[07:53:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking at that TR issue but I still don't get it
[07:53:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The text colour is only wrong in the Google map.
[07:53:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Our stuff is good.
[07:54:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you don't have a ui-body-d or ui-page-theme-d class in your markup you won't get the font color of that swatch
[07:54:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But he has ui-body-d on the body.
[07:54:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it's working fine with our stuff, but not with the Google map.
[07:55:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The Google map is getting the "d" font colour.
[07:55:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: he says he doesn't want "d" body style, but he add class ui-body-d to the body or page?
[07:55:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I'm assuming that's because there's no intervening div between body and the map which is setting some other font colour.
[07:55:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think he doesn't want the d text colour inside the Google map.
[07:56:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are right that font color is inherited
[07:56:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so this is not a TR issue at all
[07:56:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[07:56:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I closed it.
[07:56:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was afraid there was a problem with the regex
[07:56:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[07:57:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Doesn't look like it.
[08:41:33] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:50:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[08:52:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What do you think about doing DOM parsing in the Gruntfile instead of doing those crazy .replace() things in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L394?
[08:53:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: In the process of fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6941 I had to make replaceCombinedCssReference() actually parse the tag and modify the href in order to avoid clobbering the paths given to grunticon() in that demo.
[08:53:27] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: That sounds like a much more sane idea
[08:53:39] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: can you create a ticket and assign it to me?
[08:53:59] <gseguin> oh so you're taking care of it?
[08:54:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well, I'm in the middle of fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6941 and also trying to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6677 so I could give it a shot. 
[08:55:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: feel free
[08:55:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Problem is, parsing DOM requires external libraries, and I've tried one and it was horribly slow. I don't wanna diss any one in particular, but I think it might've been jsdom ...
[08:55:32] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: if you want to defer it to me, no problem
[08:55:50] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll try my hand and let you take over if I become bogged down - cool?
[08:55:52] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: is cheerio not enough?
[08:56:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, so /that's/ what that does? :)
[08:56:18] * _|Nix|_ pounces on the cheerio documentation
[08:56:29] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it's jQuery for node
[08:57:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, wow! So, I guess then I can simply give it the filename in a string and then .find(), .children(), etc.
[08:57:09] <_|Nix|_> I mean the file contents, not the filename.
[08:57:23] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: indeed
[08:57:31] <_|Nix|_> Woah! Way rad!
[08:57:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L447
[08:58:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I just saw that :)
[08:58:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, we should definitely be doing that for the path adjustments.
[08:59:01] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I agree, much cleaner than regex
[09:00:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, the thing is we have a project management issue here. I wanna fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6941 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6677 so we can push the fix to 1.4.x ... if I create an issue about replacing the whole shebang with DOM manip, that might raise the scope to 1.5.0.
[09:00:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^ (wifi allowing)
[09:00:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[09:01:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're talking about fixing paths for dist/demos by doing DOM manip in stead of a sequence of .replace() calls.
[09:02:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no thats not part of the library in the sense of breaking chnges and the such thats infrastructure
[09:03:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I could push that as soon as ready?
[09:03:58] <arschmitz> sure just do a pr
[09:04:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[09:04:35] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: That is infra related, version doesn't matter
[09:04:42] <arschmitz> the only reason we were avoiding the name changes and such on files was to high a potential to accidnetly break the demos builds and stuff 
[09:04:42] <_|Nix|_> OK. Sweet!
[09:04:54] <_|Nix|_> Gotcha.

[09:12:13] <gseguin> arschmitz: did we branch yet?
[09:12:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: no but we need to before there are anymore comits
[09:13:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm, I was gonna suggest we first merge the 1.4.3 PRs. Is it too late for that?
[09:13:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, like, we could cherry-pick them, of course.
[09:14:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we can keep up this wait to merge 1.4.x prs for ever 
[09:14:12] <arschmitz> we need to branch to start 1.5 and cherry pick things
[09:14:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that's cool.
[09:16:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We have 7 pulls marked 1.4.3.
[09:16:36] <arschmitz> ok
[09:17:23] <_|Nix|_> It's st00pid you can't filter by milestone on the pulls page, and that you can't show only issues on the issues page ... *shake head*
[09:17:33] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:17:39] <_|Nix|_> We should write our own GH client.
[09:17:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You've actually kinda started with the PR checker :)
[09:17:59] <arschmitz> they need to just git rid of pulls page and make a filter for issues vs pulls in issues page since they considder pulls issues
[09:18:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[09:18:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could also use a project-specific filter that eliminates issues addressed by pulls.
[09:18:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Though I bet many projects could use such a filter.
[09:19:00] <arschmitz> you mean just make a PR label
[09:19:03] <arschmitz> ?
[09:19:21] <arschmitz> and then you can just go into pulls check all and apply that label?
[09:19:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. If there exists a PR such that merging it would fix issue X, then do not list issue X.
[09:19:34] <_|Nix|_> s/fix/close/
[09:19:48] <arschmitz> oh 
[09:20:23] <_|Nix|_> that would be insanely awesome, because you would know what bugs are still completely unattempted.

[10:24:55] <agcolom> 'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
[10:24:59] <agcolom> should I just do another git pull upstream master?
[10:25:58] <agcolom> arschmitz: ? help ?
[10:27:51] <agcolom> I'm noticing 1.4.3 is missing from the list ^ 
[10:28:13] <arschmitz> agcolom: yup whoever tagged that didnt push the commit to master
[10:29:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: can you cherry pick your commit please
[10:29:23] <agcolom> arschmitz: how can we recover from this? 
[10:29:34] <arschmitz> just need to pull the commit to master
[10:29:47] <arschmitz> then the tags and commits will be in sync
[10:29:51] <agcolom> git pull upstream master ?
[10:30:22] <arschmitz> agcolom: no he bumped the package.json with out pushing a tag
[10:30:38] <agcolom> ok
[10:30:54] <arschmitz> so we need to push a tag for 1.4.3
[10:31:03] <agcolom> sright
[10:31:06] <arschmitz> i think and then you should be able to npm version patch again
[10:31:08] <agcolom> right
[10:31:30] <agcolom> but I'm already on 1.4.4 when I did npm version patch
[10:31:30] <arschmitz> once thats done you can git pull --rebase origin master and be back in sync local
[10:31:37] <gseguin> is it me again?
[10:31:43] <arschmitz> right because its 1.4.3 in the package.json
[10:31:51] <arschmitz> gseguin: nope _|Nix|_ this time :)
[10:31:59] <arschmitz> and slightly different
[10:33:24] <agcolom> arschmitz: origin is agcolom and upstream is the real thing
[10:33:26] <agcolom> for me
[10:33:44] <arschmitz> ok well you know what i mean :)
[10:34:00] <agcolom> arschmitz: so to summarise, I wait for _|Nix|_ to push 1.4.3, 
[10:34:11] <arschmitz> yeah im guessing he has it local
[10:34:16] <arschmitz> and just didnt push the tag
[10:34:31] <agcolom> and then I go git pull --rebase upstream master
[10:34:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure.
[10:34:46] <arschmitz> yeah and you should be good after that
[10:34:48] <agcolom> and that will put me back in sync with 1.4.3?
[10:35:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have which tag?
[10:35:13] <arschmitz> yup and then npm version patch to 1.4.4 
[10:35:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: api 1.4.3
[10:35:21] <agcolom> ok,
[10:35:38] <arschmitz> you have a commit on master updating package.json but there is no tag
[10:35:48] <_|Nix|_> OK. Should I push it?
[10:36:29] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15gabrielschulhof tagged 06last-reported at 14a90c73e: 02http://git.io/kXj4-g
[10:36:35] <_|Nix|_> Dang ... you can't just push one tag ...

[10:36:47] <_|Nix|_> OK. v1.4.3 should be up.
[10:37:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sorry if I've held you up :/
[10:37:22] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: no problem '-)
[10:37:26] <agcolom> ;-)
[10:37:40] <agcolom> arschmitz: am I good to go?
[10:38:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think so
[10:39:10] <agcolom> git pull --rebase upstream master
[10:39:10] <agcolom> From github.com:jquery/api.jquerymobile.com
[10:39:11] <agcolom>  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
[10:39:12] <agcolom> Current branch master is up to date.
[10:39:27] <agcolom> not sure that's enough?
[10:39:35] <agcolom> didn't seem to do anything
[10:40:32] <agcolom> arschmitz:  ^
[10:40:42] <scottgonzalez> Cathing up on the log now...
[10:41:13] <scottgonzalez> agcolom: You shouldn't be rebasing.
[10:41:21] <scottgonzalez> Also, the problem was that you pushed to origin instead of upstream.
[10:41:44] <agcolom> oh yes!
[10:41:48] <agcolom> Sorry!
[10:42:00] <agcolom> I followed the instructions on the site
[10:42:02] <scottgonzalez> Never rebase to fix a broken tag.
[10:42:24] <scottgonzalez> You need to reset and delete the tag instead.
[10:43:02] <agcolom> (http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/)
[10:44:33] <agcolom> scottgonzalez: git reset ?
[10:45:05] <scottgonzalez> Yes, reset to before the commit that changed package.json
[10:46:05] <agcolom> should I use git reset --hard origin/master ?
[10:46:37] <scottgonzalez> No
[10:46:59] <scottgonzalez> origin/master is definitely not what you want, since you couldn't push to that.
[10:47:05] <agcolom> just git reset?
[10:47:14] <scottgonzalez> Look at your log.
[10:47:17] <scottgonzalez> Find the commit.
[10:47:21] <scottgonzalez> Reset to that.
[10:48:04] <scottgonzalez> It's probably HEAD^, but your log will tell you for sure.

[10:51:58] <agcolom> Deleted tag 'v1.4.4' (was 4e15eed)
[10:52:16] <scottgonzalez> Now git pull --rebase upstream master
[10:52:35] <scottgonzalez> Well, wait.
[10:52:42] <scottgonzalez> You're in master right now?
[10:53:02] <agcolom> I'm in master
[10:53:57] <scottgonzalez> Ok, so just `npm version patch`
[10:54:01] <scottgonzalez> You're already up-to-date.
[10:54:15] <agcolom> v1.4.4
[10:54:26] <agcolom> so tag and push but to upstream ?
[10:54:32] <scottgonzalez> yes
[10:55:21] <agcolom> just to be sure: 
[10:55:22] <agcolom> git push --tags upstream master

[10:56:24] <scottgonzalez> no problem
[10:56:51] * agcolom now goes to have a glass of wine!
[11:15:48] <arschmitz> lol i just have to say i like that you told her not to rebase to fix that then told her to do the exact same rebase i said just added removing the tag she already had  ( which i assumed she would know to do but bad assumption i know )  
[11:18:31] <scottgonzalez> I told her to reset first.
[11:18:40] <scottgonzalez> Rebasing a tag commit isn't a good idea.
[11:23:08] <arschmitz> yeah i was meaning for her to rebase the upgrading to 1.4.2 commit not the tag
[11:23:58] <arschmitz> anyway just thought it was funny thats all 
[11:24:29] <arschmitz> your instructions were better htough

[13:10:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for fixing those demos path issues
[13:11:16] <uGoMobi> we fixed them after every 1.4 release, but still they are broken again the next release :(
[13:11:57] <agcolom> scottgonzalez: so we will have a section on how to report pb as part of jquery-wp-content? 
[13:32:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should be updating these paths by parsing the DOM, not by matching against regexs.
[13:33:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll try to use cheerio to parse the DOM when dealing with HTML files.
[13:34:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5973#issuecomment-36498806?
