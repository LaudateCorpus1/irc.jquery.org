[03:56:17] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, one thing I noticed is that on deployed layout, download builder and themeroller does NOT work very well in small widths... Any thoughts?
[03:59:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: downloading UI on a smartphone?
[03:59:29] <jzaefferer> really?
[03:59:59] <rxaviers> rxaviers, I've resized my browser window to widths like ~ 400px
[04:00:01] <rxaviers> ops
[04:00:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ^
[04:04:03] <rxaviers> gnarf, jzaefferer, would it be possible to update stage with current download builder?
[04:05:56] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, actually, resizing my window to 906px, makes download builder to overflow parent limits
[04:06:26] <rxaviers> correcting myself:
[04:06:31] <rxaviers> - themeRoller 906px
[04:06:47] <rxaviers> - download builder 750px

[04:10:22] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, well, I can easily them by setting relative widths instead of fixed ones
[04:10:26] <rxaviers> will fix it
[05:11:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, those sizes should be supported
[05:12:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: as for updating stage, that should happen automatically whenever you push to master
[05:12:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, for download builder I've fixed. But themeRoller seems a little tougher, because it actually needs a little more width to fit
[05:12:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you can ping gnarf, give him your public ssh key, to get access to that box
[05:13:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, automatically? good to know! great
[05:13:38] <rxaviers> ok thks
[05:14:25] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: once you've got access, use `sudo tail -f -n 50 /var/log/syslog` to see what's going on. Look for download-ui.sh entries to see output from download builder installation/updates
[05:17:05] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ok thanks. I think the auto update will be enough. (will check) thks
[05:17:07] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[05:17:07] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #664: FIXED in 7 min 27 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/664/
[05:23:55] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: will every download, when it includes a theme, make requests for images to the existing themeroller?
[05:24:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I wonder if we could add an in-memory cache for each image, so that downloading the same theme twice loads the images just once
[05:41:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, It can be done. Im pretty the image file name are unique and we could cache based on it. Although, I think it would be necessary to handle cache growth somehow
[05:41:13] <rxaviers> pretty sure*
[05:41:26] <rxaviers> names*
[06:05:53] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[06:18:17] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: can you make an estimate for the memory usage?
[06:18:58] <jzaefferer> if it would be problematic, we could use an MRU cache, but that might add more complexity then its worth
[06:19:53] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, or, what do you think if we cache named themes images? and not the custom ones?
[06:20:04] <rxaviers> might be the top downloaded anyway
[06:20:19] <rxaviers> and we know for sure how much of its memory it will use
[06:21:17] <rxaviers> (Im guessing that would be the average DL)
[06:22:15] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: only caching named images sounds good
[06:22:33] <rxaviers> ok will work on that then
[06:22:55] <jzaefferer> that way it can be at most "number of themes" * "size of images per theme"
[06:23:45] <jzaefferer> base theme is 74kb
[06:23:46] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, base theme images have 22KB
[06:23:58] <jzaefferer> huh
[06:24:16] <jzaefferer> I guess OSX filesystem has everything at at least 4kb...
[06:24:22] <rxaviers> ah!
[06:24:26] <jzaefferer> or generally 4kb blocks?
[06:24:32] <jzaefferer> soo, 24kb...
[06:24:40] <jzaefferer> sounds to me like we could just cache everything :p
[06:24:48] <rxaviers> ehehe
[06:25:09] <rxaviers> but, at some point it will blow. Wouldnt it? that's my concern.
[06:25:22] <jzaefferer> 1gb ram -> 40k themes
[06:26:00] <jzaefferer> zabbix is supposed to monitor memory usage, so if we ever get a problem, it should let us know...
[06:26:34] <rxaviers> ok, if an external app is responsible for restarting server on crash, we may be good
[06:27:35] <jzaefferer> well, hopefully we notice the memory issue before it crashes
[06:27:46] <jzaefferer> but based on the above numbers, its really unlikely to ever become a problem
[06:28:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I've fixed ThemeRoller and DownloadBuilder for small widths. Would you like to quick review it or may I go ahead and commit? (https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/compare/smallerWidths)
[06:28:22] <jzaefferer> production boxes should have several GB of memory, and even with a lot of custom themes we probably won't get close to several ten thousand themes anytime soon
[06:28:29] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: looking
[06:28:32] <rxaviers> ok
[06:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> Let's not cache everything.
[06:28:46] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[06:28:46] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #67: FIXED in 22 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/67/
[06:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> Stick to just named themes for now.
[06:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can eventually add a smart cache.
[06:29:15] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, DownloadBuilder fix is pretty smooth. ThemeRoller fix is: when overall width is small, it splits the application from demo.
[06:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> But cache everything seems bad. I doubt customized images are likely to get a cache hit.
[06:31:50] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, so only named theme images
[06:31:58] <rxaviers> ok
[06:31:58] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: testing the smallerWidths branch locally now
[06:32:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, alright, testing it visually is more fun
[06:32:43] <rxaviers> As soon as it's on stage, I will test it in IE (via browserstask)
[06:33:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: for the site we actually don't care as much in browser support as we care for the actual framework, but would be good to make sure its not completely broken
[06:33:37] <rxaviers> ok
[06:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> We want to support IE7+ for sites.
[06:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> But I wouldn't worry about that too much right now.
[06:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> 47m is working on new CSS and markup patterns.
[06:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll eventually have the site working much better.
[06:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com in general isn't that great on mobile devices (at least not on iPhone which is the only thing I've looked at so far).
[06:35:02] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: looking good, let's land that; not so good, the Advanced Theme Settings section - can you replicate the behaviour and design from the existing download page for that?
[06:35:43] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, about Advanced Theme Settings section, I've actually replicated the existing js
[06:35:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: the search field is awful right now, with the transparent background and dark gray placeholder text...
[06:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, I couldn't get the placeholder text to change color.
[06:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to play with that.
[06:36:12] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: this is what I'm seeing: http://bassistance.de/i/058f07.png
[06:36:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can we just set a white background?
[06:36:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah! oh oh.. It should be hidden. Mm
[06:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It affects all sites.
[06:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> Look at qunitjs.com
[06:38:02] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, weird. that doesnt happen here. Wondering if js or html could be possibly cached?
[06:38:19] <rxaviers> download.js is supposed to .hide() that
[06:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I have cache disabled and I still see that.
[06:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps something blew up during the build?
[06:39:47] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, thks for letting me know.
[06:40:37] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, on stage, I also see that! mm.. Not locally
[06:40:44] <rxaviers> though
[06:41:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, I didn't actually check locally
[06:41:14] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: doesn't work locally anyway, and I guess its not deployed to stage yet?
[06:42:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, stage still dont have my ThemeRoller small width layout fix
[06:42:55] <rxaviers> let's check it out
[06:43:13] <rxaviers> gnarf, mr Corey!
[06:44:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://bassistance.de/i/19945b.png http://bassistance.de/i/376640.png
[06:45:49] <rxaviers> gnarf, hello! Could you help me getting access to the stage machine? I'd like to check what's the latest download builder commit there to make sure we are up to date before checking possible bugs
[06:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you change the color of the text field for when the user types too?
[06:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> That change seems fine to me.
[06:49:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: api.qunitjs.com/menu-header.php has absolute URLs, which get properly rewritten to dev/stage URLs. qunitjs.com/menu-header.php has relative URLs, and //api.qunitjs.com never gets updated

[06:49:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You can fix that in web-base-template if you want.
[06:49:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: with custom text inside the input: http://bassistance.de/i/21ea48.png
[06:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> We don't support HTTPS anywhere right now though.
[06:50:33] <jzaefferer> UI and Core have absolute URLs, so I guess that's the way to go
[06:50:41] <jzaefferer> I'll also refactor into a shared template
[06:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/config.php#L67
[06:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> If you wanted to get protocol-relative URLs working.
[06:52:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ah, okay, so we just drop the "http:" twice?
[06:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> But then what happens when someone does "http:api.qunitjs.com" ? :-P
[06:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> I still to this day have never seen someone do that.
[06:54:29] <jzaefferer> O_o
[06:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> It works everywhere :-)
[06:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> I learned that reading the URI RFC...
[06:57:28] <jzaefferer> weird
[06:57:53] <jzaefferer> well, pushed two updates, one for the search field styles, one for the rewrites and qunit menu-header
[06:59:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez gnarf: we've got one actually failing test of UI against 1.8: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/877
[06:59:37] <jzaefferer> specifically 1.8.0
[06:59:56] <jzaefferer> yak, stupid Invalid Argument :/
[07:00:28] <jzaefferer> may just be another hiccup :/
[07:00:32] <jzaefferer> let's run that job again!
[07:00:57] <jzaefferer> I've set workers to just one in Jenkins, got tired of all the timeouts

[11:52:48] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[13:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: hey
[13:12:32] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: hey. I noticed in the .xsl, you're looking for added, deprecated, removed as attributes.
[13:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> It uses both.
[13:13:03] <kswedberg> uses both for added, but not for deprecated/removed, right?
[13:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> The existing code had a mixture of uses, so I just updated it to use both in all places.
[13:13:31] <kswedberg> hmm.
[13:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using grunt-jquery-content 0.5.1?
[13:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com might still be on an older version.
[13:14:15] <kswedberg> dunno. how do I find out?
[13:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> npm ls
[13:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> package.json says 0.5.x so if you're on an old version, you just need to `npm update`
[13:15:22] <kswedberg> 0.5.0
[13:15:57] <kswedberg> ok. will try again now. thanks
[13:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Any update on subdirectory sites?
[13:18:10] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: hey, sorry. let me push it. give me 15-20.
