[05:58:45] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... are the demos intentionally broken?
[05:59:21] <_|Nix|_> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/
[06:00:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its because gislan moved that jquery.js and forgot a refrence it looks like
[06:00:37] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/abc97542dd55aef1c906d6cb3be07bc9c1720fce
[06:00:46] <arschmitz> its now in external/jquery/jquery.js
[06:00:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and jquery.ui.widget.js is no longer part of jQuery Mobile, so that also needs to have its own script tag.
[06:00:51] <uGoMobi> right
[06:01:56] <arschmitz> tabs also
[06:02:02] <arschmitz> and ui core
[06:02:32] <_|Nix|_> OK ... just checking ...
[06:02:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think about https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/8417507?
[06:05:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It certainly makes the input-inside-a-panel interaction sane.
[06:05:22] <arschmitz> yeah i looked real quick need to look closer
[06:05:32] <arschmitz> and also make sure this is the right way to go about this.
[06:06:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's kind of a special case right now. If/when we move the rest of the touch events over to this approach we should get rid of the extra "bubble" parameter, and have all generated events bubble.
[06:07:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the case of swipe, the assumption is that the mousedown, once encountered by the swipe event's mousedown handler will not be used by another element's swipe event mouse handler.
[06:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... as it bubbles up the DOM, possibly encountering elements that also have swipe handlers attached.
[06:08:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the case of swipe, this works because you don't consider any mouse events unless you've considered mousedown.
[06:09:51] <_|Nix|_> rxaviers: Does UI have any custom events we an take a look at?
[06:10:38] <_|Nix|_> I'm not seeing any ...
[06:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> We have tons of custom events. I assume you mean special events though.
[06:18:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, sorry ... I grepped the code for "special", and the word only occurs in comments :)
[06:20:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Dunno if you've talked to arschmitz already, but we're running into an interesting problem: We're using a sequence of mouse events to decide whether to trigger a swipe event. But mouse events bubble, so if a swipe handler is attached to an element as well as its parent, setup() gets called for both, and the same decision is made for both elements, resulting in two swipe events.
[06:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll need a flag to track that the event is already being handled.
[06:21:54] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, that's what I've done. I've marked the mousedown with a custom flag saying "this event is already being used for swipe event calculation" ...
[06:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> That unfortunately won't work.
[06:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> We tried that in UI.
[06:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> You can get a different event object for every level of bubbling.
[06:22:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I noticed that too.
[06:23:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So I decided to dive through all layers of event.originalEvent, and set the flag on the lowest event.
[06:23:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Like, theEvent = event; while ( theEvent.originalEvent ) { theEvent = theEvent.originalEvent }; theEvent.jqmUsedForSwipe = true;
[06:24:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That seems to work ... or it happens to work :)
[06:24:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Of course, that's also /extremely/ shallowly tested.
[06:25:17] <_|Nix|_> Sorry about all the mentions. I can't seem to kick the habit ... heh ...

[06:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I think we might have tried that too. I think IE creates a new native event at each layer.
[06:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Mentions don't bother me :-)
[06:29:34] <_|Nix|_> Gah!
[06:29:45] <_|Nix|_> So, there's really no way to distinguish ... dang nab it!
[06:29:52] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[06:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Search for "mouseHandled"
[06:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda ghetto, but it's the only thing we've found that works.
[06:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers figured it out.
[06:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js
[06:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> That's where kborchers implemented it originally.
[06:31:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, I see ...
[06:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> Just so you understand that we really do feel your pain... http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4333
[06:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> It took us 2.5 years to fix the problem.
[06:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> And probably at least a dozen attempts.
[06:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> And a few reverts.
[06:33:13] <arschmitz> yeah iv attempted fixes to our swipe event a bunch of times
[06:33:21] <kborchers> ah yes, i remember that hack :)
[06:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> I remember sitting down every few months and working on this and getting so frustrated.
[06:34:05] <_|Nix|_> Man ... once more we waste our energy on IE :(
[06:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> I was shocked and elated when kborchers sent the PR.
[06:40:22] <_|Nix|_> OK. I think the flag approach will work. I just can't store the flag on the event.
[06:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's a shame because storing on the event is so clean.
[06:43:25] <_|Nix|_> Incidentally, what is the correct way of retrieving the document to which an element belongs? Can I just use .ownerDocument?
[06:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: ping
[06:54:07] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Nevermind, I commented on the PR.
[06:57:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Dang nab it! It works starting with IE9 ... 
[06:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, so just require jQuery 2.0 :-P
[07:02:11] <_|Nix|_> :)
[07:02:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just out of curiousity - are we relegating IE8 to C-level anytime soon?
[07:03:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see a need to do that
[07:04:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know, I know, ... *sigh* ...
[07:08:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz and I already talked a bit about a different browser support model
[07:09:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: define browser support for each feature instead of for whole framework
[07:10:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for example ie7 the only reason we dont support it any more is icons
[07:10:39] <arschmitz> but if we just said hey ie7 does not get icons then it could still use the rest of the lib
[07:10:50] <uGoMobi> right
[07:10:54] <arschmitz> and not be kicked down to c grade
[07:11:00] <_|Nix|_> I see ...
[07:11:10] <_|Nix|_> Well, yeah ... granularity is what we're all about.
[07:11:41] <arschmitz> and honestly does it make since to kill the whole lib over icons?
[07:15:19] <_|Nix|_> RIght. I guess it doesn't.
[07:17:12] <uGoMobi> agreed, although there were some other benefits from not supporting IE7 anymore as A-grade
[07:20:39] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... that's where IE is especially devious. We keep around crappy workarounds and we abstain from elegant solutions only to support IE.
[07:22:36] <uGoMobi> or Android 2.3
[07:26:34] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, like DaveMethvin said ... it's the new OldIE :/
[08:12:08] <rxaviers> _|Nix|_, sorry I was away...
[08:12:38] <rxaviers> anyway, I wasn't aware of that background... I've just learned from the comments too :)

[09:55:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[10:00:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[10:02:05] <arschmitz> think iv finished animation complete
[10:02:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[10:02:35] <arschmitz> added the ability to when possible look at what the animation duration should be according to css
[10:02:40] <arschmitz> then it uses triple that
[10:02:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not bad ...
[10:02:57] <arschmitz> other wise you can specify a value or it uses 1 second as last resort
[10:03:09] <_|Nix|_> Sounds good.
[10:03:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/8422773
[10:04:33] <arschmitz> and it binds exactly 1 event so no need to unbind
[10:07:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if there is a chance that the event will never happen then you should unbind.
[10:07:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, the context for the callback if css transitions are not supported is different from when they are supported.
[10:08:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that was already like that
[10:08:34] <arschmitz> i didnt change that but i did notice it
[10:08:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we should file a bug ...
[10:09:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: probably
[10:09:39] <arschmitz> and i had an unbind in the time out originally but i see while working on this i changed it at some point
[10:09:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is the duration always reported in seconds?
[10:09:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually the context cant be the same
[10:10:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as far as i can tell i have to do more testing though 
[10:10:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we set it in ms
[10:10:30] <arschmitz> and it comes back in seconds
[10:10:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that's good. Core might normalize units.
[10:11:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh the context thing i remember now
[10:11:59] <arschmitz> wait nevermind
[10:12:08] <arschmitz> yeah maybe file a bug or i can just fix now
[10:12:33] <arschmitz> i noticed it in first place because tests rely on context but actual framework does not
[10:13:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, because we probably use $.proxy in the framework.
[10:13:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[10:14:08] <arschmitz> the one catch to the auto detect for timeout
[10:14:22] <arschmitz> is the animation class has to be added before you call animation complete
[10:14:38] <arschmitz> or it has no way to know what it will be
[10:15:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and that's not good practice, because then you're assuming things are asynchronous.
[10:15:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not really your just assuming the animation has some durration 
[10:16:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, yeah, because if there's no animation, the handler never gets called anyway.
[10:16:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, there's the fallback timeout ...
[10:17:07] <arschmitz> because if you add a class then immediately bind the handler even if durration is 1 all code between is sync 
[10:17:14] <arschmitz> so it will bind before event happens
[10:17:25] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[10:17:39] <arschmitz> and in theory there would be no code inbetween
[10:18:37] <arschmitz> and if durration is zero it still tries to listen for event
[10:19:01] <arschmitz> but says 0 i dont buy it and falls back to 1000ms
[10:19:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, that's what I'm saying. Even if you later modify the CSS turning off the animation, the callback will still be called as if there is still an animation.
[10:20:12] <arschmitz> thats kinda the whole point
[10:20:29] <arschmitz> if you use this you want to ensure the callback happens NO MATTER WHAT!
[10:20:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, so if you turn off animation via CSS and you don't want the 1s gap you need to go back in and just do things synchronously.
[10:21:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's the best we can do in the face of browser crappiness.
[10:22:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think so
[10:22:54] <arschmitz> this might fix some or all of the "transition to a blank page" issues
[10:23:31] <arschmitz> because it ensures the page is shown there was no insurance of that before i recall ones about scroll like crazy durring transition issues
[10:24:09] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, you might wanna check up on those issues. Might net them all with this fix.
[10:25:29] <arschmitz> yup and it fixes autogrow memory leak and ios panel breaking
[10:26:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess I can switch to using .animationComplete after you land your fix.
[10:27:07] <arschmitz> oh it probably also fixes the memory leak durring page transition issue we had
[10:27:19] <arschmitz> because we were binding multiple events every time 
[10:29:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... transitions use it too. So does fixedToolbar and popup.
[10:29:10] <arschmitz> yup
[10:29:30] <arschmitz> fixes tons of memory leaks
[10:32:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I still think you should var context = $( this ), failsafeTimeout = function() { $( this ).off( cssProps[ animationType ][ animationName ].eventName ); callback.call( context[ 0 ], arguments ); }); That way, if the animation end event never happens, you've removed even that one handler. Or did I mention this before?
[10:32:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: already said i was going to
[10:33:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, OK. Good! NM then.
[10:33:05] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!
[10:33:06] <arschmitz> :)
[10:33:19] <arschmitz> i originally had it like that and changed it at some point debugging
[10:33:28] <arschmitz> just need to change it back
[10:34:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, if you add clearTimeout to the body of failsafeTimeout() you can pass failsafeTimeout both to setTimeout() and to .one()
[10:35:04] <arschmitz> yup
