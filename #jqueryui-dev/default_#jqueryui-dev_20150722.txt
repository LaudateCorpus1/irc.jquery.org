[08:23:11] <gabrielschulhof> Hurray!
[08:23:31] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping! 
[08:23:35] <cgack> finally
[08:24:52] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: hey
[08:25:44] <arschmitz> cgack: awesome its good to be green again!
[08:26:02] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[08:26:18] <gabrielschulhof> I was looking at the table review and it's waaay out of date.
[08:26:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:26:55] <arschmitz> that was just a review not a classes update from what i recall
[08:27:01] <gabrielschulhof> There's one basic problem though: Both the reflow extension and the columntoggle extension introduce the "mode" option, but they each set it to a different value.
[08:27:08] <gabrielschulhof> Is that normal?
[08:27:27] <arschmitz> not if you want sanity with amd
[08:27:33] <gabrielschulhof> Excactly.
[08:27:56] <gabrielschulhof> So, how do you think we should do it? I was thinking about defining the option in the base class, but making no use of it.
[08:28:02] <gabrielschulhof> Like, mode: "default"
[08:28:16] <arschmitz> so what do you get from tabkle with neither extension?
[08:28:23] <arschmitz> does it just style it
[08:28:30] <gabrielschulhof> The absence of option "mode"
[08:28:32] <gabrielschulhof> Nono ...
[08:28:51] <gabrielschulhof> The value of the option is essential, because the extension will not react if the option has the wrong value.
[08:29:15] <arschmitz> like if you do a build with neither reflow nor toggle
[08:29:17] <gabrielschulhof> So, if you have mode: "reflow", the columntoggle extension will short circuit and vice versa.
[08:29:21] <arschmitz> what does table do exactly
[08:29:29] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Not much. Adds class ui-table.
[08:29:52] <gabrielschulhof> Well, actually, also sets some attributes on the headers.
[08:30:39] <arschmitz> i think what we need to ask our selves is what the table widget it self should do on its own
[08:30:47] <arschmitz> and then figure out the extensions from there
[08:32:01] <gabrielschulhof> Well, the idea was that the base class contains common behaviour but is not useful on its own, whereas the extensions provide the two different kinds of look and feel.
[08:32:41] <gabrielschulhof> In a sense, one of the extensions should be the base class, but all its methods should short-circuit if the mode is the other one.
[08:35:11] <arschmitz> thats kinda what im getting at
[08:35:22] <arschmitz> that or should the base do something more similar to listview
[08:35:27] <arschmitz> where it just styles based on options
[08:35:28] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: You want me to set it up that way?
[08:35:34] <arschmitz> and the behavior is an extension
[08:35:46] <gabrielschulhof> But there's not much styling involved.
[08:35:57] <arschmitz> there could be
[08:36:02] <arschmitz> why not have an inset table
[08:36:08] <arschmitz> and a regular
[08:36:33] <gabrielschulhof> OKOK. One step at a time :) I'm just trying to achieve feature parity while reviewing the widget and added the classes option :)
[08:37:52] <gabrielschulhof> From what you're saying it sounds like we might want to keep the base class around and have it be more useful in the future, where that future might even be 1.5, if we find the time.
[08:37:54] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: do you remember the last time we got a bug report on 2.3 
[08:37:56] <arschmitz> ???
[08:38:24] <gabrielschulhof> TBH, I haven't been watching the bugs for a while ...
[08:38:40] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: for table yes thats my thought make the base more usefull
[08:39:08] <gabrielschulhof> OK, so, for the sake of feature parity, I'll keep the base around and declare the mode option in the base, setting its value to "default".
[08:39:43] <gabrielschulhof> ... and the columntoggle extension will act only if the value is set to "columntoggle", and reflow will act only if the value is set to "reflow".
[08:40:35] <gabrielschulhof> So, you can actually have a default table even if both extensions are loaded.
[08:45:45] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: the base should not have the option
[08:45:56] <arschmitz> both should add the option but both should set it to null
[08:46:45] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[08:52:12] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: So, I've put the whole table thing on hold, because I'm a bit burned out. I'm now concentrating on your popup and page comments. How exactly is the spacer span supposed to be added? Right before the icon span and just <span> </span>?
[08:52:54] <gabrielschulhof> Like <a href="#" class="something">Button text<span> </span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-something></span></a>?
[08:53:00] <arschmitz> you dont add the span
[08:53:06] <arschmitz> just litterally put a space
[08:53:14] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK. Gotcha!
[08:53:28] <gabrielschulhof> Of course! The icon span acts like a word.
[08:54:07] <arschmitz> we only use the span for tracking purpose so it can be easily removed 
[08:54:13] <gabrielschulhof> For some strange reason the icon span is sometimes outside the anchor O_o
[08:54:16] <arschmitz> in the widgets
[08:54:34] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: must have been done with a search and replace that went wrong
[08:54:41] <gabrielschulhof> Yep. Looks like.
[08:55:22] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm, actually, I could do the replace again and right this time.
[08:55:38] <gabrielschulhof> Though the regex might not be possible,
[09:19:08] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: you still here?
[09:21:04] <gabrielschulhof> Yes. What's up?
[09:21:16] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: ^
[09:21:40] <arschmitz> how would you feel about dropping full support of android 2.3 in 1.5
[09:22:03] <gabrielschulhof> ... but leave partial support?
[09:22:13] <gabrielschulhof> How do you mean "dropping full support"?
[09:22:19] <arschmitz> basicly do like was done in core when ie 7 was dropped
[09:22:28] <arschmitz> not remove any existing work arounds
[09:22:36] <gabrielschulhof> OK, just let things bit rot?
[09:22:40] <arschmitz> but not fix or test any more
[09:22:47] <gabrielschulhof> Sure.
[09:22:50] <arschmitz> and in 1.6 we could remove stuff
[09:23:00] <arschmitz> but gurantee it parses and thats it
[09:23:02] <gabrielschulhof> Support doesn't die, it just fades away :)
[09:23:12] <arschmitz> in 1.5
[09:23:21] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[09:23:25] <arschmitz> thoughts?
[09:23:46] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: this is mostly in reference to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2483
[09:24:22] <arschmitz> cgack: ^^
[09:31:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ohhh we may try to get a ui beta out next week or week after it seems
[09:32:41] <gabrielschulhof> *whew* ... I dunno where we're gonna by by then, but I don't think we'll be near a beta ...
[09:32:50] <arschmitz> no
[09:32:53] <gabrielschulhof> ... if panel and table have anything to say about it.
[09:32:58] <arschmitz> but it will make things easier for us
[09:33:07] <arschmitz> and we can shoot for an alpha soon after hopefuuly
[09:33:13] <gabrielschulhof> Well, UI hasn't been a moving target for a while now.
[09:33:16] <arschmitz> alphas can be a little buggy lol
[09:33:29] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: execpt im about to land breaking up their core
[09:33:33] <arschmitz> and we depend on that 
[09:33:38] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, but they shouldn't be missing things ...
[09:33:53] <arschmitz> no
[09:33:55] <gabrielschulhof> Right, one more move of our target before release - hopefully.
[09:34:39] <gabrielschulhof> Reading the discussion from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2483, it sounds like Android 2.3 is the new IE6 :(
[09:34:53] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:35:48] <gabrielschulhof> Considering that, unlike core, we don't even run tests on Android at all, I think the lack of bug reports is either a miracle, or evidence of abandonment.
[09:36:15] <gabrielschulhof> Android 2.3.5, that is.
[09:36:20] <gabrielschulhof> Or 2.3.
[09:36:45] <gabrielschulhof> Well, we don't run tests on any Android, but we're not getting any bugs from 2.3, AIUI.
[09:37:14] <arschmitz> right
[09:37:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: for ui the thing is ui has always officially supported the same browsers as core
[09:39:40] <jzaefferer> right, but a lot of that has been very "passive"
[09:39:44] <arschmitz> yes
[09:39:57] <arschmitz> but this would mean we officially drop support too
[09:39:59] <jzaefferer> we've never actively tested anything on 2.3, at least on regularly 
[09:40:05] <arschmitz> or have different support then core
[09:40:13] <arschmitz> its a mostly political decision
[09:40:16] <arschmitz> not a code one
[09:40:27] <jzaefferer> we're not exactly in sync anyway
[09:40:27] <arschmitz> for ui
[09:40:32] <jzaefferer> We've dropped IEs before Core
[09:40:53] <arschmitz> oh yeah 6 was different
[09:41:12] <arschmitz> 7 was the same
[09:41:38] <arschmitz> so i guess its always been the same or less
[09:41:41] <arschmitz> but never more
[09:42:16] <jzaefferer> We don't even mention any mobile browsers: http://jqueryui.com/browser-support/
[09:42:38] <arschmitz> heh i guess your right
[09:42:47] <arschmitz> to be clear im not against this change
[09:42:56] <arschmitz> i just wanted to make sure it was discussed
[09:46:02] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: popup-outside-multipage doesn't work because there's a bug in the enhancer that's fixed in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8175. Should I fix it in my PR as well? It would envolve unchaining after .enhanceWithin(), which is currently at fault for not returning its context.
[09:46:10] <gabrielschulhof> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8068#issuecomment-123786417
[09:46:20] <arschmitz> nah
[09:46:26] <gabrielschulhof> OK. I'll check it off then.
[09:46:29] <arschmitz> we can just let enhancer fix it
[09:46:45] <gabrielschulhof> Right.
[09:46:53] <gabrielschulhof> Maybe I should add a note to check that demo.
[09:47:05] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:47:43] <gabrielschulhof> Done.
[09:50:54] <gabrielschulhof> Ugh ... that vimeo video is ancient and ugly ...
[09:51:56] <arschmitz> feel free to get a new one
[09:52:20] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Maybe we should have something like a video showing white sandy beaches and palm trees, or something.
[09:52:30] <arschmitz> lol
[09:52:34] <gabrielschulhof> ... without advertising any kind of travel agency.
[09:52:41] <arschmitz> i would just pick something non technical so its not dated
[09:52:48] <gabrielschulhof> Right, exactly.
[09:52:54] <arschmitz> star wars theme
[09:53:10] <gabrielschulhof> Wait wait ... we gotta worry about copyright concerns, I think.
[09:53:40] <gabrielschulhof> ... and having logos appear within our stuff ... I'd tread carefully.
[09:53:57] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Also which browser has the video popup disappearing so soon?
[09:54:04] <gabrielschulhof> I tried Chrome/desktop and it's fine.
[09:54:52] <gabrielschulhof> Firefox/desktop also seems fine.
[09:56:05] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i noticed on ios and android
[09:56:13] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXDnFYu91vY
[09:56:26] <arschmitz> lol
[10:01:41] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Cool, but again, I wouldn't want the wrath of Disney bearing down on me.
[10:02:06] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i was not serious
[10:02:20] <gabrielschulhof> I know, I know :)

[10:04:41] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I don't get it. I have a chat bookmarked called "jQuery Project Leads" ... is that the same thing?
[10:04:44] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ^^
[10:04:45] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[10:04:56] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no thats not the same

[10:05:23] <gabrielschulhof> What's your user name?
[10:05:27] <arschmitz> i just added you as a contact
[10:05:30] <arschmitz> you just need to accept

[12:29:24] <rxaviers> arschmitz, Re: "Yeah i would really like to get a good handle on where we are with that and what i need to do to get movile on it" (cc jzaefferer)
[12:29:28] <rxaviers> Basically, create `lib/jquery-mobile-package-1-x.js` using https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/d60e586ccae7b3b6ac67
[12:29:32] <rxaviers> Then, create an entry on download.js similar to https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/download.js#L96 
[12:29:41] <rxaviers> Just let me know in any questions...
[12:33:49] <arschmitz> ok im looking now
[13:25:18] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Ping! enhancer is updated
[13:40:54] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:42:16] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Can you please mention specific platforms for the remaining unchecked items in the popup classes PR? I'm having trouble reproducing. I don't have a Windows 8.1 device, but I know Windows has trouble with popup history - which is why I thought I had disabled history on Windows, but who knows?
[13:48:15] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: In the case of filterable tests, I'm noticing that filterable_core.js no longer needs to be touched. That is, you were able to remove the $( "body" ).enhance() statement, which is good. Were you not also able to remove the explicit loading of "page" (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8175/files#diff-a01600c5aab15f8b0b5e35083422b84cL22)?
[13:51:50] <arschmitz> oh i missed that ill try
[13:51:57] <arschmitz> i did notice a failure im fixing right now
[13:52:21] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: if they are not specific i think it means they happened on chrome but let me look again
[13:52:51] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I've reproduced the video-induced disappearance on iOS 6.
[13:52:55] <arschmitz> ok
[13:53:08] <gabrielschulhof> It happens only when you click play.
[13:53:11] <arschmitz> the other 2 mention the platforms
[13:53:23] <arschmitz> windows phone 8.1 and firefox
[13:53:52] <gabrielschulhof> OKOK, but was it firefox/desktop?
[13:53:56] <arschmitz> yes
[13:54:00] <gabrielschulhof> ... because that works for me :/
[13:54:03] <arschmitz> oh
[13:54:07] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[13:54:24] <arschmitz> it looked like an issue on google side anyway to be honest
[13:54:26] <gabrielschulhof> I'll try again, to be sure, and I have FF on my Android 2.3.5 phone as well.
[13:54:34] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[13:54:46] <gabrielschulhof> Can I mark it as checked then?
[13:54:53] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: also i thought you had a lumia with windows 8
[13:54:57] <arschmitz> yes
[13:55:03] <gabrielschulhof> Yes, but not Windows 8.1
[13:55:14] <arschmitz> all 8 devices can be upgraded as far as i know
[13:55:15] <gabrielschulhof> AFAIK, anyway.
[13:55:24] <gabrielschulhof> OK ... I suppose I can try.
[13:55:27] <arschmitz> it should ask you as soon as you start it
[13:55:33] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[13:56:04] <arschmitz> its 100% consistent on all popups too
[13:56:11] <arschmitz> execpt dynamic
[13:56:39] <arschmitz> browserstack has windows phones too
[13:57:15] <gabrielschulhof> Holy shitsu! On iOS 6.1, after closing the video popup and refreshing, I have a play button towards the top of the page O_o
[13:57:54] <gabrielschulhof> Not upon closing the tab and opening a new one though O_o
[13:59:35] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Oooh! Video popup issue reproduced 100% on iOS 6.1
[13:59:58] <gabrielschulhof> That is, after clearing cache, the popup once again disappears.
[14:04:00] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:04:17] <arschmitz> thats what i saw on 8 too
[14:06:18] <gabrielschulhof> Interesting. If I copy the code via View Source into an empty document, I can no longer reproduce. So, this might be a demos thing.
[14:06:31] <arschmitz> hmm
[14:06:46] <arschmitz> so what weird thing are we doing in demos
[14:06:56] <arschmitz> oh
[14:07:06] <gabrielschulhof> I am about to embark on a journey to find that out.
[14:07:14] <arschmitz> it might be the history manipulations we do for the header links
[14:07:17] <gabrielschulhof> Unless your "oh" provides a shortcut.
[14:07:18] <arschmitz> i would disable that first
[14:07:22] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[14:07:56] <arschmitz> because the place i recall seeing this before did something similar
[14:11:57] <gabrielschulhof> OK, wow! So, I open the standalone popup video test page I made, I close the video popup, try to close the tab, and the browser crashes. Not good.
[14:12:35] <arschmitz> nope
[14:22:06] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Sure enough, when the popup disappears, it does so because it receives a navigate event. I wonder how that comes about.
[14:23:00] <gabrielschulhof> I might just leave it as a mystery until the morning. I'm bushed.
[14:23:25] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/demos/_assets/js/h2widget.js#L46
[14:23:30] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ^^
[14:23:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: The disappearance also seems to coincide with the popup's overlay having trouble rendering.
[14:24:12] <gabrielschulhof> Wow! OK, definite candidate for commenting out :)
[14:24:25] <gabrielschulhof> At least as a debug procedure :)
[14:24:34] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yeah thats a hack
[14:24:46] <arschmitz> because we have not made it possible to do historyless updates still
[14:25:11] <gabrielschulhof> What exactly do you mean? We have changeHash: false?
[14:25:29] <arschmitz> this is not doing a page change
[14:25:44] <arschmitz> just changing the hash
[14:25:44] <gabrielschulhof> No, right, I'm assuming it's a jump within the page, right?
[14:25:48] <arschmitz> yes
[14:26:14] <arschmitz> its stripping the has mid navigation
[14:26:30] <arschmitz> and then putting it back and scrolling
[14:26:34] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ... it seems so simple - like, in the click handler, don't prevent default and don't call pagecontainer.change() if you can't find the hash ... 
[14:26:49] <gabrielschulhof> But, of course, it's not that simple ...
[14:26:52] <arschmitz> nope
[14:27:04] <arschmitz> i wrote this in a hospitol lol
[14:27:08] <arschmitz> hospital 
[14:27:26] <gabrielschulhof> :)
[14:27:36] <gabrielschulhof> Or should I say :(
[14:27:43] <arschmitz> no :)
[14:27:55] <gabrielschulhof> OK, :) it is ... :)
[14:28:15] <arschmitz> when my son was born well hours leading up to
[14:28:34] <arschmitz> along with the entire old FAQ's
[14:28:58] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, yes! I had an inkling, but I wasn't sure. I remember you were working even then, and when you mentioned you had written this in a hospital, I suspected that might've been the time :)
[14:29:06] <gabrielschulhof> Well, fond memories then, fond memories :)
[14:29:23] <gabrielschulhof> That's a hell of an annotation to that hack :)
[14:30:17] <gabrielschulhof> Not too many people can point to a piece of code and say "I wrote that when my son was born" :)
[14:30:20] <gabrielschulhof> Super-cool!
[14:31:21] <arschmitz> lol
[14:31:35] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: ugh so with rebase on 1.5-dev
[14:31:45] <arschmitz> im getting failures in slider like all over the place
[14:31:52] <arschmitz> but slider backcompat passes...
[14:34:16] <arschmitz> doh!!!
[14:34:25] <arschmitz> its data-ui-*
