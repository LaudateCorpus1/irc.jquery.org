[03:53:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[03:54:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[03:54:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not sure if you know anything about this but im sure you would be at the very least more informed then me
[03:55:18] <arschmitz> Hyunsoook: had sent the email with the button example they had done
[03:55:28] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[03:55:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i had talked to uGoMobi about the because it was not in any way what we asked for
[03:56:12] <arschmitz> and he was supposed to talk to them about this but the pr they just submitted is exactly the same.
[03:56:29] <arschmitz> do you know if he has talked to them or whats going on there
[03:56:51] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I thought we had established that it's mostly just demo/documentation work, rather than code changes.
[03:57:04] <arschmitz> yeah they are parsing and using wrapper class
[03:57:10] <arschmitz> and removing the option already
[03:57:22] <arschmitz> and changing it to always false for the value in practice
[03:58:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i there is not any changes to even make for 1.5 besides saying they are deprecated that i can really thing of
[03:59:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: my only real concern is i dont want to piss of contributors because they spent the time on this and even sent emails asking if it was ok
[03:59:23] <arschmitz> then as soon as they submit a pr i flat out reject it for not being what we want
[04:00:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know you work with them a lot more then i do. what do you think the best way to handle it at this point is?
[04:05:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lemme check our meeting logs at http://web-ui-fw.github.com/irc-logs/ ... I'm pretty sure we've covered this.
[04:06:28] <arschmitz> ok
[04:08:35] <Hyunsook> arschmitz, _|Nix|_: hmmm... did my team do anything wrong regarding to removing the style option of Button?
[04:10:13] <Hyunsook> arschmitz, _|Nix|_: If there are any problems, please let me know.
[04:10:45] <arschmitz> Hyunsook: hi
[04:11:04] <Hyunsook> arschmitz: hi~

[09:28:29] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ping
[09:44:00] <gseguin> mornin'
[10:19:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey! Got a PR for ya: https://github.com/gseguin/jquery-hashchange/pull/1
[10:20:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: looking
[10:21:39] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I kind of disagree with the use case
[10:22:05] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: if you're going to copy/paste the library you might as well do that modification yourself
[10:22:12] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: don't you think?
[10:22:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: The only purpose of this fork was to remove the use of $.browser
[10:23:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: many people i feel like are going to do this and have no idea what the error is or why they are getting it
[10:23:40] <arschmitz> especially if its minified 
[10:23:48] <gseguin> why would you do that ?
[10:24:01] <gseguin> and not use a <script src> ?
[10:24:14] <gseguin> especially if you're a novice?
[10:24:56] <gseguin> saving 1 HTTP request?
[10:25:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: i have no great reason reason but people do crazy things
[10:25:17] <arschmitz> and possibly lol
[10:25:58] <arschmitz> and i know the purpose of the fork however submitting a pr to the original is not really an option
[10:26:26] <gseguin> Then why would we encourage them to do crazy things by making it easier?
[10:26:55] <gseguin> ya, Ben is not maintaining it anymore
[10:27:20] <arschmitz> gseguin: just seems like best practice to makes sure cases like this are properly escaped
[10:27:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: why SHOULDN'T our code be valid when in a script tag?
[10:28:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: curious do you have an opinion on have a string that contains "</script>" and if that should be escaped?
[10:30:14] * gseguin **crickets**
[10:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't escape it.
[10:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.js#L24
[10:31:09] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: are you saying I should stand my ground ? ;)
[10:31:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if it was in ui core?
[10:31:59] <arschmitz> not just tests would that make a difference?
[10:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'd only change it if there were people on the team who felt strongly about it.
[10:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> In a personal project, I probably wouldn't change it.
[10:33:00] <_|Nix|_> Well, we have a bug about it, and it's pretty counter-intuitive that it fails when pasted inline.
[10:33:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: to me it just seems like best practice so that if some crazy person copys it into a script tag that it still works 
[10:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> "best practice" and "crazy person" in the same sentence isn't a big winner for me :-P
[10:33:34] <_|Nix|_> It's actually poor parsing on the part of the browser if you ask me.
[10:33:35] <gseguin> but that's the thing, if you make it easy to misuse the library
[10:33:43] <gseguin> then you encourage the misuse
[10:33:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: true
[10:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's not poor parsing. It actually makes sense if you understand what's happening.
[10:33:59] <_|Nix|_> This isn't necessarily misuse.
[10:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> The HTML parser knows nothing about scripts, so it doesn't know what the content is.
[10:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> It can only do string-based parsing.
[10:34:31] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess you're right.
[10:34:34] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: arguable
[10:35:10] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it's not a misuse indeed but it's not good practice
[10:35:12] <_|Nix|_> I remember seeing a sequence of comments and <![CDATA[ enclosures that's supposed to make the script atomic, but I'm being told that's not 100% reliable. Any second opinions?
[10:35:40] <_|Nix|_> Something like <script>//<![CDATA[ or something like that.
[10:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> The CDATA stuff was only for XML parsing.
[10:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> So you could use angle brackets.
[10:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Like `if ( x < 10 )`
[10:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, it's certainly not *bad* to escape it.
[10:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> I personally prefer the `\x3script` over concatenation.
[10:37:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... but I'm afraid it won't have any effect, because it sounds like the browser is parsing the doc as HTML, in which case the <![CDATA[ will be ignored.
[10:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> If there's contention, you should probably just land it.
[10:40:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd suggest escaping the < rather than concat.
[10:41:07] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Escaping with //<![CDATA[ doesn't work in FF27.
[10:41:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that wont work in any html document its for xml 
[10:41:57] <_|Nix|_> Right, that's what I figured, but now I have empirical evidence to back it up.
[10:43:02] <_|Nix|_> So, yeah ... I'm fine with making it wontfix and explaining to the OP that the script tags present in the body of the script need to be escaped in some way, shape, or form.
[10:43:24] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: commented, will land once you change to escaping
[10:43:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. Cool! Can do.
[10:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually surprised that uglify doesn't kill the concat.
[10:44:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you need to update the bower.json to pick up the right version after the PR lands
[10:44:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, that's another PR against the lib.
[10:51:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: PR updated.
[10:52:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: and that works?
[10:53:27] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: Can you just amend your commit to fix your commit message?
[10:57:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/7300.html has the escaped leading <
[10:57:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hope that URL works. I've recently shuffled my routers :)
[10:57:35] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yup it works
[10:57:49] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, what did you need me to do in the commit message?
[10:58:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I've amended the commit to go from "<scr" + "ipt>" to "
[10:58:18] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: The commit message still says "break up" instead of "escape"
[10:58:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, duuuuh! Sorry!
[11:01:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: How's about now? I've updated the commit message.
[11:06:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: merged

[11:32:48] <_|Nix|_> gs	
[11:33:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, how do I update via bower?
[11:33:14] <_|Nix|_> I ran bower update, but it had no effect on the repo.
[11:33:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did you update the version number?
[11:33:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I've edited bower.json and updated the entry for jquery-hashchange with the hash for the new head of jquery-hashchange master.
[11:33:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[11:34:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but git diff shows only that change, even after running bower update.
[11:35:37] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: bower update jquery-hashchange ?
[11:36:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, OK. I need to specify the actual module to update. Gotcha!
[11:37:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That also doesn't fetch and overwrite the previous version.
[11:39:08] <_|Nix|_> OK. WTF?! How do I get bower to fetch it?
[11:39:20] <_|Nix|_> I'm just gonna end up copying it by hand, which is bad.
[11:41:21] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! I run bower install --save jquery-hashchange, it asks me which one of two different ones I want, then it changes the whitespace in bower.json, producing an inordinately large diff, and /doesn't/ grab hashchange.js and put it where it needs to be.
[11:41:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: breathe
[11:42:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: A bit of a learning curve, I'd say ...
[11:42:37] <gseguin> what if you do `bower uninstall jquery-hashchange && bower install`
[11:44:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nope. Nothing.
[11:44:39] <gseguin> pastebin me your bower.json
[11:45:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/10169812
[11:46:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It's exactly the same as what's in master, except I've modified the hash for jquery-hashchange
[11:46:38] * gseguin tries it out
[11:46:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Also, shouldn't the version read 1.5.0pre?
[11:46:59] <gseguin> if it's in master, yes it should
[11:48:35] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: wfm
[11:49:04] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: `bower --version`
[11:49:12] <_|Nix|_> 1.3.2
[11:49:27] <gseguin> you're even more up to date
[11:49:28] <_|Nix|_> I just npm -g bower, like, 5 mintues ago.
[11:49:45] <gseguin> so I did:
[11:49:55] <gseguin> - update the hash in bower.json
[11:50:03] <_|Nix|_> ✓
[11:50:03] <gseguin> - bower update
[11:50:13] <gseguin> - grunt bowercopy
[11:50:15] <_|Nix|_> ✓
[11:50:39] <gseguin> and now when I git status I get:
[11:50:41] <_|Nix|_> Oh ... grunt bowercopy. Didn't know about that.
[11:50:51] <_|Nix|_> So, I ran that, and now it's good.
[11:50:51] <gseguin> 	modified:   bower.json
[11:50:51] <gseguin> 	modified:   external/jquery/plugins/jquery.hashchange.js
[11:51:07] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, the git diff is now as I expected it.
[11:51:20] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: oh yeah, we don't use the bower_components directory
[11:51:32] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, bottom line: I didn't know about grunt bowercopy
[11:51:41] <gseguin> sorry
[11:51:51] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey, no worries! My bad, totally!
[11:52:29] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... what shall be my commit message? What's the component for this change?
[11:52:33] <_|Nix|_> Build?
[11:52:43] <_|Nix|_> Not really, because I'm updating a lib dependency.
[11:52:45] <_|Nix|_> External?
[11:52:48] <_|Nix|_> Hashchange?
[11:52:51] <_|Nix|_> Navigation?
[11:53:14] <_|Nix|_> I'll go for navigation.
[11:53:18] <gseguin> I would use Build: but that's because it's my go-to component
[11:53:22] <gseguin> arschmitz: ^
[11:53:50] <arschmitz> build i would say
[11:54:13] <arschmitz> its a dependency update its not a change to the library code so its no a part of nav
[11:54:51] <_|Nix|_> Well, alright ...

[12:15:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's funny. What if they never sign the CLA and we make the same change?
[12:15:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so be it
[12:15:27] <arschmitz> but when you make a comment like Good catch! However, in order for us to accept these changes, you must first sign the contributor license agreement. Please sign it!
[12:15:36] <arschmitz> you make it clear you have looked at their changes
[12:15:51] <arschmitz> so if you ever make them your self in the future you have no way of denying you already saw theirs
[12:16:05] <arschmitz> in this case the change is trivial so its not a big deal
[12:16:13] <arschmitz> but we need to handle all pr's the same
[12:16:19] <_|Nix|_> Actually, the commit message is pretty self-explanatory.
[12:16:34] <_|Nix|_> ... and I can't avoid seeing that.
[12:16:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: avert your eyes
[12:16:47] <arschmitz> :)
[12:16:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What?! Not even the commit message?
[12:17:21] <arschmitz> lol you should just not say anything about the pr other then asking them to sign the cla if they have not signed yet
[12:17:33] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that is still the process correct?
[12:17:45] <_|Nix|_> OK. Understood.
[12:22:52] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7279 ... what exactly is deprecated in the remote data source demo? I see nothing deprecated there.
[12:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's the process, but in reality, it should never be an issue.

[14:33:49] <rxaviers> gseguin, Ive done a change on cldr.js lib, and Im having an AMD problem. Have you possibly seen this? https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/10194312
[14:45:07] <arschmitz> rxaviers: you still here?
[14:45:19] <rxaviers> yeap
[14:45:33] <arschmitz> i was reading through your gist
[14:45:37] <rxaviers> \o/
[14:46:09] <arschmitz> and i noticed one thing noticed was in your diff of the index
[14:46:19] <arschmitz> the new line is missing .js
[14:46:25] <arschmitz> or rather just the js
[14:47:08] <rxaviers> Yeap, I need to fix it in the gist.. But, it was simply a gist issue :( Problem still persists
[14:47:24] <arschmitz> yeah i figured but figured it was worth mentioning
[14:48:17] <rxaviers> gist fixed, thanks ;)
[14:48:27] <rxaviers> (absolutely)
[14:50:05] <arschmitz> rxaviers: also there is more then just name change in your main.cldr.js
[14:50:45] <arschmitz> rxaviers: but its just in what your logging so should not matter
[14:51:12] <rxaviers> ah! right, anyway I should fix that too. :D
[14:51:45] <rxaviers> good catches though ehhe
[14:52:42] <arschmitz> trying to see whats different that would cause the issue
[15:11:38] <rxaviers> arschmitz, I guess it has anything to do with the relative way my cldr/supplemental.js requires cldr.js = define([../cldr], fn)
[15:12:10] <rxaviers> but, I can't understand why it could fail anyway.
