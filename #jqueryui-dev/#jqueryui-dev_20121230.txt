[07:16:51] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hi scott! Just read your email
[07:17:39] <rxaviers> you mean google's cdn link there or http://jqueryui.com/download/all/ ?
[08:02:00] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I've checked out new-css of web-base-template. I see a red theme on jqueryui now. Have we reverted sidebar on ThemeRoller page? Or is it me (perhaps I need to update/refresh something)?
