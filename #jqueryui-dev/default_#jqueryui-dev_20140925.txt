[05:35:36] <jasperdegroot> hmm for some reason the ThemeRoller has not been deployed :(
[05:35:45] <jasperdegroot> I did push the tag
[05:39:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, I have to run an errand ... I'll BB in about half an hour, if all goes well ...
[05:39:57] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ill check on it
[05:40:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[05:42:14] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[05:45:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: our infra has been a bit nuts the last week so im trying to give them the day off
[05:45:26] <arschmitz> but ill see what i can do
[05:45:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok
[05:46:15] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: not sure if you have seen everything on twitter but its been a rough week
[05:46:17] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: the ugly way is to tag again and see if it deploys this time
[05:47:18] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, saw that
[05:47:20] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: have you ever heard of control.jquerymobile.com?
[05:47:28] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yes
[05:47:41] <arschmitz> what is it is it still used by themeroller some how?
[05:47:54] <arschmitz> its on an old machine and as far as i could tell not doing anything anymore
[05:47:59] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I used that for deploying the TR
[05:48:07] <arschmitz> do you still?
[05:48:15] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: but not anymore since we can deploy by pushing the tag
[05:48:25] <arschmitz> ok yeah pretty sure it would not work
[05:48:27] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: no, didn't use it for long time
[05:48:34] <arschmitz> it points at an old repo and an old server
[05:48:49] <arschmitz> actually the repo does not even exist anymore its from or pointing at lol
[05:48:56] <arschmitz> cool so ill just kill it

[12:34:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: As I go through panel, I've noticed that the class key insanity can be tamed somewhat if we introduce class keys ui-panel-position-{left,right} and ui-panel-display-{reveal,push,overlay}.
[12:34:59] <arschmitz> right i thought we already decided we had to have all those
[12:35:05] <arschmitz> because those are structural classes
[12:35:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, but we can re-organize the classes to have fewer keys.
[12:36:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Instead of .ui-panel-position-left we have .ui-panel.ui-panel-position-left
[12:36:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Essentially, instead of composing class names using string concatenation in JS we add two classes.
[12:37:02] <gabriel_schulhof> That makes sense conceptually as well, because ui-panel-position-left should be a key.
[12:37:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Things that need to be applied to any and all elements to implement the position-left panel.
[12:37:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Same for display.
[12:38:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Then we can remove fifteen keys, and add add seven. IOW, save eight.
[12:38:21] <arschmitz> im not sure i follow
[12:38:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/201515d62ba84f93eabe#file-gistfile1-js-L2-L6
[12:38:46] <gabriel_schulhof> There are three groups of five keys. The first group is highlighted.
[12:39:11] <arschmitz> yup
[12:39:58] <arschmitz> so what do you want to change im still confused
[12:40:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Instead of having those, we can have five keys: ui-panel-position-{left,right}, and ui-panel-display-{reveal,push,overlay}, and compose those with .ui-panel (to get the first group), with .ui-panel-dismiss (to get the second group), and .ui-panel-page-content to get the third group
[12:40:38] <arschmitz> so you want it to be a nested object?
[12:40:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ui-panel is already defined, so we need only add ui-panel-dismiss and ui-panel-page-content.
[12:40:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono.
[12:40:47] <gabriel_schulhof> It'll still be flat.
[12:41:09] <gabriel_schulhof> But the suffixes will not repeat themselves.
[12:41:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Instead they'll be classes on their own.
[12:41:22] <arschmitz> how?
[12:42:10] <gabriel_schulhof> So .ui-panel-position-left -> .ui-panel.ui-panel-position-left, and .ui-panel-dismiss-position-left -> .ui-panel-dismiss.ui-panel-position-left
[12:42:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Notice the class ui-panel-position-left is now reused.
[12:43:52] <arschmitz> yeah im not so sure about that
[12:45:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Can you please elaborate?
[12:45:37] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm curious as to whether it used to be this way and was abandoned for a good reason.
[12:45:53] * gabriel_schulhof takes a trip down git blame lane.
[12:48:11] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, I'll have to take another look, but right now I need to put my daughter to bed. BBIAB.
[12:54:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im just not sure thats a good idea or the proper use of the option
[12:55:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: wait that does not even work there will be a dot in the class name
[12:55:28] <arschmitz> and we dont name our classes that way

[14:22:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: OH MAN WE SUCK!!!!!
[14:23:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we are creating duplicate id's in selectmenu when it falls back to a dialog
[14:23:10] <arschmitz> which breaks a bunch of stuff
[14:31:47] <Omar-> hi
[14:37:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh i see no thats right we rip it out but this breaks out filter a select demo if it is long and goes to a dialog as it does not rip out the filtering too
[14:38:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wha ... ?
[14:38:21] <arschmitz> yup
[14:38:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I disconnected briefly. I'll check the logs.
[14:38:37] <arschmitz> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/selectmenu-custom-filter/
[14:38:43] <arschmitz> does not work if its a long list
[14:38:56] <arschmitz> because we rip out the list to put it in the dialog in selectmenu
[14:39:02] <arschmitz> but the filtering and form dont go with it
[14:39:11] <arschmitz> and you can listen to listviewcreate because its the same list
[14:39:32] <gabriel_schulhof> They don't? They're supposed to.
[14:39:57] <gabriel_schulhof> I actually have code for ripping out the filter and putting it in the dialog.
[14:40:04] <gabriel_schulhof> I've never tested it with a long list though.
[14:40:17] <gabriel_schulhof> I've resized the window to cause the short list to be rendered as a dialog.
[14:40:19] <arschmitz> yeah i have jsbin just a sec
[14:40:37] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/wevapu/3/edit
[14:40:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: of course one of my relatives would be the one to notice lol
[14:42:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Good.
[14:42:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Wanna file an issue?
[14:42:22] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or shall I?
[14:42:32] <arschmitz> you can if you want your demo :)
[14:42:50] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll do it.
[14:44:30] <Omar-> hi arschmitz
[14:44:35] <Omar-> hey gabriel_schulhof
[14:44:53] <arschmitz> Omar-: Hi
[14:45:10] <Omar-> arschmitz how are you?
[14:45:18] <arschmitz> Omar-: good 
[14:45:34] <Omar-> you're no longer showing in SO
[14:45:44] <arschmitz> Omar-: huh?
[14:45:53] <Omar-> ppl need your and the team's knowledge there
[14:46:00] <Omar-> SO stackoverflow
[14:46:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: 
[14:46:06] <arschmitz> Omar-: oh i dont check there normally unless someone tells me
[14:46:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Sorry! 7677-selectmenu-custom-filter-data-filterable has modifications to the code, so this may already be fixed.
[14:46:57] <arschmitz> oh so we just never landed it?
[14:47:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Not in time for 1.4.4.
[14:47:08] <arschmitz> oh ok
[14:47:23] <arschmitz> is there a pr i dont remember that being on the list ?
[14:47:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ^^
[14:48:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7681 - that may actually not fix it. I'll test within that PR, and I'll add the fix.
[14:49:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah dont think that will fix it
[14:49:39] <arschmitz> the fix needs to be in the demo
[14:49:48] <arschmitz> its not the lib thats the issue
[14:50:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, I know. It's just that that PR modified the demo, so, if I made another PR against master, that would almost certainly cause merge conflicts.
[14:51:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'd rather tack this fix onto that PR, and have the PR fix two issues.
[14:51:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: makes sense 
[14:56:48] <Omar-> arschmitz what's the purpose of .lastScroll in history stack?
[14:57:57] <arschmitz> Omar-: to maintain scroll position
[14:58:50] <Omar-> arschmitz when you navigate back to that page, it doesn't scroll back to that position.
[14:59:01] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes it does
[14:59:44] <arschmitz> Omar-: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/transitions/
[14:59:51] <arschmitz> scroll down click any dialog or page button
[14:59:54] <arschmitz> then click back
[15:00:52] <Omar-> arschmitz true, but only by navigating back in history
[15:01:10] <arschmitz> Omar-: what do you mean only by navigating back in history?
[15:01:17] <arschmitz> when else would it be maintained?
[15:01:21] <Omar-> but not when you visit it again with a link
[15:01:29] <arschmitz> Omar-: thats impossible
[15:02:00] <arschmitz> and not how browsers work anyway
[15:02:09] <arschmitz> scroll position is saved nativly
[15:02:15] <Omar-> arschmitz I know, that's what I was trying to figure out
[15:02:17] <arschmitz> and maintained when navigating history
[15:02:25] <arschmitz> we do exactly the same
[15:03:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this demo is uh LACKING http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/popup-alignment/#&ui-state=dialog
[15:05:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess it needs a blurb.
[15:05:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: BTW: A long list works just fine.
[15:05:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: not quite yeah i didnt notice he was using 1.4.2
[15:05:46] <arschmitz> 1)    After I upgraded to 1.4.4, the dialogue now has a search. 
[15:05:46] <arschmitz> 2)    If I type in the dialogue search to filter, select an option, then click the drop down again, I get a popup (because the list is still filtered) with no search box.  This means I cannot clear the filter to get the entire list again.
[15:05:46] <arschmitz> 3)    If there are a few items in the list, I get a popup with a search.
[15:06:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I think that can be closed.
[15:06:51] <gabriel_schulhof> People really need to try the latest and greatest before reporting an issue.
[15:07:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll still add the long list example to the demo, because I've changed the demo to key off a class, rather than off a list of IDs.
[15:07:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its my fault i didnt check his jsbin when he emailed me
[15:07:30] <arschmitz> its not like i sent him to the issue tracker
[15:07:30] <Omar-> gabriel_schulhof true. they even need to read more and more
[15:07:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, this was via email. OK.
[15:07:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hes a relative of mine and emailed me directly
[15:08:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Don't worry about it. It motivated me to improve the demo a little more.
[15:08:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what about that last issue i just posted though
[15:08:24] <arschmitz>  If I type in the dialogue search to filter, select an option, then click the drop down again, I get a popup (because the list is still filtered) with no search box.  This means I cannot clear the filter to get the entire list again
[15:08:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Now, it can handle any number of examples, as long as you add class filterable-select to the select you want to make filterable.
[15:08:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Let's see.
[15:09:32] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. That's still present.
[15:09:32] <arschmitz> Omar-: oh something i forgot to tell you a long time ago
[15:09:47] <arschmitz> with the pageshow hide stuff there is a huge reaosn why i removed those i never mentioned
[15:10:00] <arschmitz> there are native pageshow and pagehide events these conflict with
[15:10:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok 
[15:10:19] <Omar-> arschmitz I'm all ears ;)
[15:10:38] <arschmitz> Omar-: there are native pageshow and pagehide events these conflict with
[15:10:40] <Omar-> conflict with each other?
[15:10:53] <arschmitz> yeah because they are completely different and mean different things
[15:10:56] <arschmitz> yet have the same name
[15:11:07] <arschmitz> thats very very bad
[15:11:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, NM. I forgot to carry my generalizations to both pagecontainerbeforeshow and pagecontainerbeforehide.
[15:11:49] <Omar-> that's why you've decided to replace them with pagecontainer events then
[15:12:06] <Omar-> your toPage plugin has solved the issue
[15:12:11] <arschmitz> thats not the only reason as i explained in those issues 
[15:12:16] <arschmitz> but its part of it
[15:12:23] <arschmitz> and yes that plugin removes this issue
[15:12:24] <Omar-> but why cant you integrate it with jQM?
[15:12:46] <arschmitz> Omar-: because just because you can do something does not mean you should
[15:12:52] <arschmitz> this is not needed 
[15:13:00] <arschmitz> i really would not recomend people use it 
[15:13:05] <arschmitz> i recomend they use the proper event
[15:13:16] <Omar-> this leads to another question arschmitz. What's the best practice, using page ID or URLs in jQM?
[15:13:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: what do you mean they are very different?
[15:15:26] <Omar-> arschmitz I meant to get full control over jQM webapp, is it better to use page ID to bind event, manipulate, listen to pagecontainer events
[15:15:50] <Omar-> or do all the stuff based on URL changes
[15:16:30] <Omar-> my question may look vague or newbie, I'm not an experienced person in that field
[15:17:12] <arschmitz> you should never handle url changes in jqm
[15:17:23] <arschmitz> we are very clear on this in the docs 
[15:17:38] <arschmitz> never manipulate the url or listen to popstate / hashchange
[15:17:54] <arschmitz> use the documented pagecontainer methods and events
[15:18:02] <Omar-> handling urls, I agree, jqm takes care of it
[15:18:39] <Omar-> then page ID is the best practice
[15:18:50] <Omar-> right?
[15:21:45] <arschmitz> yes
[15:22:07] <Omar-> thanks arschmitz
[15:22:13] <Omar-> one last request ;)
[15:23:46] <Omar-> pagebeforechange: It should be noted that callbacks can modify both the toPage and options properties to alter the behavior of the current changePage() call. So for example, the toPage can be mapped to a different url from within a callback to do a sort of redirect.
[15:24:04] <arschmitz> yes
[15:24:11] <Omar-> http://jqmtricks.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/pagecontainerbeforechange/
[15:24:18] <arschmitz> we have an example somewhere doing redirects with it
[15:24:23] <Omar-> Am I doing it right?
[15:25:23] <Omar-> I somehow have doubts and I dont want to provide ppl with wrong info
[15:27:06] <arschmitz> pagecontainerbeforechange should not trigger twice
[15:27:10] <arschmitz> if it does thats a bug
[15:28:02] <arschmitz> Omar-: either way though the second time is deprecated and going away in 1.5
[15:28:41] <Omar-> it does fire twice. jqm 1.4.4 http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/4y2y506v/
[15:30:01] <Omar-> yup, second call should go to pagecontainerbeforetransition on 1.5 as far as I remember
[15:30:36] <arschmitz> Omar-: it looks like its doing both right now
[15:31:00] <arschmitz> which is a bug but you should not relay on the second use transition 
[15:31:50] <arschmitz> if you want to make sure its the right one check the toPage prop like you mention
[15:32:03] <Omar-> arschmitz: so I should relay on first call where it returns a "string/url"
[15:32:13] <arschmitz> Omar-: yes
[15:32:18] <arschmitz> and you should mention that in the post
[15:32:39] <Omar-> I'll update the post
[15:33:02] <arschmitz> Omar-: line 16 get rid of [0] on both sides
[15:33:07] <Omar-> anyway, the way I'm modifying url is correct as in the post
[15:33:43] <arschmitz> execpt you should modify the jquery object not the dom node
[15:34:04] <arschmitz> within the object that will cause issues to crop up in weird places because of incorrect refrences within the jquery object
[15:34:40] <arschmitz> Omar-: but your basic concept is correct
[15:34:43] <Omar-> oh ok, thanks for the heads up arschmitz :)
[15:35:01] <Omar-> arschmitz hmmm..what's the advanced concept? ;)
[15:35:13] <arschmitz> advanced concept?
[15:36:09] <Omar-> nevermind, i thought there might be other ways :)
[15:37:47] <Omar-> arschmitz thanks a lot for the valuable info, I appreciate it
[15:38:08] <Omar-> keep up the good work and congrats on the promotion!
[15:38:21] <Omar-> a bit late but better than never
[15:39:01] <arschmitz> Omar-: thanks
[15:39:46] <Omar-> arschmitz my pleasure
[15:40:00] <Omar-> goodnight everyone
