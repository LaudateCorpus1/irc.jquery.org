[13:37:57] <JD-Robbs> Hi guys, just wondering why jquery-ui 1.10.5 is the latest package on npm. Is there a specific reason 1.11.4 wasn't published? Or maybe even 1.12.0-rc.
[13:43:41] <apsdehal> JD-Robbs: This may help you : https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/11101
[13:49:23] <JD-Robbs> Oh thanks! scottgonzalez comments on that page that jquery-ui was never published on npm. Yet, even the official jquery-ui 1.12.0-rc1 release notes say that they have jquery-ui on npm. I'm so confused now...
[13:50:43] <JD-Robbs> Here: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2016/03/jquery-ui-1-12-0-release-candidate-1/
[13:50:56] <JD-Robbs> "The jquery-ui package on npm is now owned and maintained by the jQuery UI team. In addition, weâ€™ve updated package.json and changed the directory structure to work better with tools like browserify and webpack. See JÃ¶rn Zaeffererâ€™s demo for webpack usage information."
[13:51:27] <apsdehal> See last comments
[14:02:04] <JD-Robbs> Duh, helps to read below the fold. Thanks mate :)
[16:12:16] <moizsajid> Can anyone please provide me feedback on my GSoC 2016 proposal? https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iLu6zevrTc_Rb8DwsM08xI5LtXD5H1GF6lHM6bHMos/edit?usp=sharing
