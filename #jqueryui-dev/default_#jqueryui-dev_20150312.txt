[07:39:38] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: did you update/rebase your button branch? Is it ready for review?
[07:48:46] <GreatDanton> jzaefferer, as I saw you are the mentor of jQuery UI -new demo system, so what exactly is the purpose of this project. To build new demos like how to make sliding menus, fancy effect using simple code, or something else?
[07:50:57] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: not yet
[07:53:20] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: let me know when its ready
[07:53:28] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: btw. YAY CLASSES :-)
[07:53:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i will
[07:53:35] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Yup !
[07:53:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: need to get some things moving along in mobile
[07:54:00] <arschmitz> and then i will circle back around to button
[07:54:28] <jzaefferer> GreatDanton: not an answer to your question, but we've been having a lot of students already interested in that project, several also working on it in some form already, so I suggest you pick something else from the list (or discuss other ideas)
[07:54:48] <GreatDanton> okay
[07:54:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: just moments ago had 2 different people email on the demos too
[07:55:52] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: let's add a note to the wiki?
[07:55:59] <arschmitz> sure
[07:56:24] <arschmitz> ask rxaviers but maybe gregorian calendar too i know thats been almost as popular
[07:57:01] <GreatDanton> how about interactive tutorials ?
[07:58:50] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: how's this? https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List also added a link to our Getting Started page at the top

[08:30:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: so all the widgets have a classes option with keys
[08:31:27] <arschmitz> at least ui-widgetname
[08:31:43] <arschmitz> the keys just dont have values
[08:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, they all support keys, they just don't define them in the default option.
[08:33:05] <arschmitz> so shouldnt the full object be defined in the api docs
[08:33:13] <arschmitz> so people know what keys they can add things too
[08:33:26] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI build #1552: STILL UNSTABLE in 4 min 39 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI/1552/
[08:33:26] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: Autocomplete: Restore focus after clicking a menu item, if necessary
[08:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I didn't review that list yet.
[08:36:28] <arschmitz> i dont think there are any widgets that dont define a classes object
[08:36:46] <arschmitz> in the api terms
[08:37:08] <arschmitz> so i think the question from jzaefferer is a non issue.
[09:08:22] <hiren_> Are we going to use javascript in phase 1: css-framework?
[09:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> I certainly hope the answer to that is "It's a CSS framework, there won't be JavaScript in any of the phases."
[09:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> But you should ask in the appropriate channel: #css-chassis
[09:16:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: hiren_: thats correct there will not be js in any phase :-) but also yes #css-chassis
[09:19:02] <hiren_> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz  sorry, by mistake i put the quetion in this channel.

[12:27:42] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: Ping!
[12:51:47] <hait> arschmitz: Ping!
[13:06:09] <arschmitz> hait: hi
[13:07:11] <hait> arschmitz: I'm interested in slider rewrite project. you're the mentor right?
[13:07:21] <arschmitz> one of them yup
[13:07:43] <hait> Can you help me how to start working on the project?
[13:08:28] <arschmitz> hait well briefly we want to write a new slider to replace both the ui and mobile one
[13:08:55] <hait> right!
[13:09:13] <arschmitz> this will start as a wiki proposing an api and structure etc
[13:09:40] <arschmitz> it will start as a wiki similar to http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[13:10:04] <hait> Ok.
[13:11:34] <hait> So do I start making proposal for API?
[13:14:14] <hait> I guess the API will be same as api.jqueryui.com/slider/
[13:14:27] <hait> unless more features are added.
[13:14:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Are we not gonna make the new slider work off an input?
[13:14:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Or at least be optionally tied to one?
[13:15:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it will work indendenatnt or with an input
[13:15:51] <arschmitz> hait: thats the proposal for the current one
[13:15:53] <arschmitz> in ui
[13:15:57] <arschmitz> its quite old
[13:16:09] <arschmitz> not proposal but api
[13:16:20] <arschmitz> so we will be revisiting it
[13:16:41] <hait> Okay.
[13:17:51] <hait> But shouldn't the new one will be supporting the old API too?
[13:19:07] <arschmitz> hait: we design new apis with out considdering the old then add backcompat
[13:19:24] <arschmitz> just because we used to do it a certain way does not mean its the right way
[13:19:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, if I this._removeClass() inside the method that also gets called from _destroy(), that's OK? That's what your textinput review comments seem to say. Just wanna double-check I didn't misunderstand.
[13:19:44] <hait> Obviously. 
[13:19:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: correct
[13:20:10] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll put it back the way it was then.
[13:21:58] <GreatDanton> arschmitz, arent you mentor for chassis as well?
[13:22:12] <arschmitz> yes
[13:22:42] <GreatDanton> so can I ask here or should i move to appropriate channel?
[13:22:54] <arschmitz> please go to #css-chassis im there too
[13:22:58] <GreatDanton> ok
[13:40:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't get what difference the calls you propose will make in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7964#discussion_r26304329 and previous ...
[13:41:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It doesn't matter how you append those two spans to the wrapper as long as the search icon ends up being the first child and the spacer span ends up being the second child.
[13:42:19] <arschmitz> this way not matter what even if we change to use wrap instead of inserting before and appending to it will still work correctly
[13:43:01] <gabriel_schulhof> We cannot use wrap(), because we need a reference to the outer. If we use wrap, we can then go .parent()
[13:43:20] <gabriel_schulhof> In fact we shouldn't.
[13:43:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Because we want to add the classes while it's detached from the DOM to avoid reflows.
[13:43:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the point is your way your adding to the end
[13:43:51] <arschmitz> its semanticly wrong
[13:44:14] <arschmitz> we want the add the element as the first child and then add the spacer immeditly after
[13:44:31] <arschmitz> append explicitly adds to the end it just happens to be its currently empty
[13:44:42] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[14:55:51] <hait> arschmitz: Can you have a look at this, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VedJ3kUOn3uWGlMdYxeSQgmOyEK-tQA2TA8wZw55Sto/edit?usp=sharing
[14:57:26] <arschmitz> that looks like what we have in ui already
[14:58:00] <arschmitz> hait: here is the one for the current ui slider http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138059/Slider
[14:58:10] <arschmitz> but this should be all new
[14:58:20] <arschmitz> and incorperate the need of both jquery ui and mobile
[14:58:50] <hait> Ok.
[14:59:12] <hait> What more is expected of this new one?
[14:59:51] <arschmitz> hait: well for one thing yours does not even incorperate multiple handles
[15:00:47] <hait> arschmitz: Yeah, it's not complete yet.
[15:03:06] <hait> I wanted to ask that what are the main points should I consider while writing the API?
[15:03:20] <arschmitz> just a sec we have a tempate im trying to find
[15:04:43] <arschmitz> hait: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138136/WidgetTemplate
[15:14:52] <hait> arschmitz: Okay. I'll go by the template and write a good API. :)
