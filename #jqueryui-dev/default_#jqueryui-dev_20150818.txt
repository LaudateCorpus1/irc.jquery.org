[11:33:48] <arschmitz_> gabrielschulhof: PING!
[11:40:09] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: ping (while you are waiting for Gabriel)
[11:40:20] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: Hi
[11:40:27] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: hey
[11:40:34] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: I was looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8114#discussion_r35799762
[11:40:54] <jasperdegroot> aren't we mixing things up there?
[11:41:13] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: in what way?
[11:41:18] <jasperdegroot> toolbar type (header or footer) and WAI ARIA role
[11:42:04] <arschmitz_> how so ? that discussion is just about the option
[11:42:11] <jasperdegroot> that line is about the toolbar type
[11:42:39] <arschmitz_> yes
[11:42:43] <jasperdegroot> maybe that should become a proper option
[11:42:56] <jasperdegroot> but it shouldn't accept anything other than header or footer
[11:42:58] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: thats what the entire thread you just lnked to is about?
[11:43:19] <arschmitz_> making it a proper option and not using that data-role
[11:43:32] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:43:48] <jasperdegroot> but that shouldn't accept a string to set role attribute
[11:44:03] <arschmitz_> thats setting this.role
[11:44:10] <arschmitz_> not the role attribute
[11:44:45] <jasperdegroot> but you are talking about role="toolbar" in your comment
[11:44:50] <jasperdegroot> that's a role attribute
[11:45:40] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: its a typo it should be data-role
[11:46:08] <arschmitz_> oh re reading i can see your confusing
[11:46:09] <jasperdegroot> aha
[11:46:44] <arschmitz_> so there are two seperate but related things here
[11:46:52] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:47:06] <arschmitz_> the aria role should be set based on the option
[11:47:16] <jasperdegroot> yup
[11:47:32] <arschmitz_> but thats not what that thread is about
[11:47:38] <arschmitz_> though my comment a line below is 
[11:47:45] <jasperdegroot> yeah i saw that too
[11:47:46] <arschmitz_> saying that needs to be updated based on the option
[11:47:49] <jasperdegroot> do we need 2 options?
[11:47:53] <arschmitz_> no
[11:47:57] <arschmitz_> i dont think so
[11:47:58] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:48:15] <jasperdegroot> header --> banner , footer --> contentinfo
[11:48:23] <arschmitz_> though we need to decide what the role should be if its neither a header nor footer
[11:48:27] <jasperdegroot> maybe nice if you can configure that
[11:48:34] <arschmitz_> if its use in the middle of a page 
[11:48:39] <arschmitz_> as an actual toolbar
[11:48:40] <jasperdegroot> if my footer contains controls
[11:48:48] <jasperdegroot> I wouldn't give it role contentinfo
[11:48:51] <arschmitz_> true
[11:49:00] <jasperdegroot> role="toolbar" is valid
[11:49:06] <arschmitz_> yes i know
[11:49:09] <jasperdegroot> that's why I got confused
[11:49:13] <arschmitz_> its what the controlgroup uses
[11:49:16] <jasperdegroot> ok
[11:49:28] <arschmitz_> im thinking thats what it should be here
[11:49:38] <arschmitz_> if its not header or footer
[11:49:44] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[11:49:44] <arschmitz_> and maybe a new option to overide?
[11:50:02] <arschmitz_> default null which means pick based on the other option
[11:50:10] <arschmitz_> if set to anything else it overrides
[11:50:34] <jasperdegroot> yeah that sound good
[11:50:44] <arschmitz_> and ill update my comment
[11:50:50] <arschmitz_> i dont think the default should be header
[11:50:55] <arschmitz_> it should be nothing
[11:51:10] <arschmitz_> or should header and nothing be essentially the same?
[11:51:29] <jasperdegroot> huh? that sounds like making header the default
[11:51:56] <jasperdegroot> a toolbar can be header, footer, or just a toolbar somewhere else, correct?
[11:52:01] <arschmitz_> yes
[11:52:18] <jasperdegroot> I would make "toolbar" the default then
[11:52:18] <arschmitz_> but right now its always a header or footer even if its somewhere else
[11:52:28] <jasperdegroot> yeah that's not good
[11:52:33] <arschmitz_> exactly
[11:52:58] <arschmitz_> but should there be a difference besides the aria role is what im getting at between a non fixed header / footer / toolbar?
[11:53:13] <jasperdegroot> and the other option to set the role attribute should be null by default which means banner if header, contentinfo if footer, toolbar if toolbar somewhere else
[11:53:29] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: thats what i just said :-)
[11:53:52] <jasperdegroot> :)
[11:54:04] <jasperdegroot> just repeating to make sure i understood you correctly :P
[11:54:09] <arschmitz_> sure
[11:54:28] <arschmitz_> so my question that remains is if you create a nonfixed header / footer / toolbar
[11:54:36] <arschmitz_> should there be a difference besides the role?
[11:54:45] <jasperdegroot> yeah I am thinking about that
[11:55:12] <arschmitz_> right now there is a small amount of position magic for headers / footers for buttons
[11:55:26] <arschmitz_> thats the only difference i know 
[11:55:35] <arschmitz_> and it could easily be removed i think
[11:58:03] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: maybe I don't understand you correctly
[11:58:18] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: when fixed we need to do page padding etc
[11:59:01] <jasperdegroot> but in the toolbar widget the only difference is that we need to add fixed class
[12:00:12] <jasperdegroot> I mean in toolbar widget _create
[12:00:40] <jasperdegroot> but this is about the position option
[12:01:08] <jasperdegroot> so I don't understand the link between this and the type and role option that we were talking about
[12:02:57] <arschmitz_> ok so when the toolbars are fixed there is a big difference between a header and a footer
[12:03:28] <jasperdegroot> yes
[12:03:33] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: but when its not the only difference im aware of is the button positioning 
[12:04:04] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: ah ok, now I understand you
[12:04:16] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: also that class addition should not be there
[12:04:19] <arschmitz_> good catch lol
[12:04:26] <arschmitz_> that should be in the fixed extension
[12:04:43] <jasperdegroot> ah yes
[12:05:17] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: by button position you mean when using ui-button-left and ui-button-right classes?
[12:05:22] <arschmitz_> yes
[12:05:26] <jasperdegroot> we don't even support that for footer
[12:05:31] <arschmitz_> correct
[12:05:36] <arschmitz_> thats the difference im talking about
[12:05:56] <jasperdegroot> can't think of anything else either
[12:06:14] <jasperdegroot> or maybe something about title
[12:06:23] <arschmitz_> oh yeah title too
[12:06:43] <arschmitz_> so a plain toolbar non fixed and a footer non fixed should have no difference besides the aria role
[12:07:06] <jasperdegroot> yes
[12:11:15] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: what do you think the new option names should be?
[12:11:53] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: can we use "type" as option name for toolbar/header/footer?
[12:12:12] <arschmitz_> i dont see why not
[12:12:19] <jasperdegroot> ok
[12:12:29] <jasperdegroot> I wouldn't use something with "role" for that
[12:12:38] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15hainzee opened issue #8269: jqm 1.4.5 loading error 02http://git.io/vsIT1
[12:12:47] <arschmitz_> yeah probably too confusing
[12:12:50] <jasperdegroot> because it's confusing with data-role (init selector) and aria role option
[12:13:08] <jasperdegroot> type = toolbar is also a bit strange
[12:13:18] <jasperdegroot> because header and footer are also toolbar
[12:13:37] <arschmitz_> yeah but they are spcial toolbars
[12:13:46] <arschmitz_> its like shape = square
[12:13:54] <arschmitz_> lol
[12:14:14] <arschmitz_> well sure square is a shape but its a specific shape
[12:14:37] <jasperdegroot> but you can end up with markup like .... data-role="toolbar" data-type="toolbar"
[12:14:49] <arschmitz_> maybe null there too?
[12:15:03] <arschmitz_> since the default is toolbar
[12:15:03] <jasperdegroot> yeah, probably better
[12:15:18] <arschmitz_> though if the default is toolbar then you should never have that markup anyway
[12:15:28] <jasperdegroot> yes
[12:16:18] <arschmitz_> hmm what do you think null or toolbar for the default i think i would still lean towards toolbar for clarity
[12:16:56] <arschmitz_> since you should never have both the role and the type as toolbar in your markup you would just be passing the default for no reason
[12:17:08] <jasperdegroot> yeah true
[12:18:38] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: or maybe "standard"
[12:18:57] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: i just commented want to look it over and see if it makes sense for what we talked about
[12:18:59] <jasperdegroot> as opposite of a specific type of toolbar (header or footer)
[12:19:05] <arschmitz_> hmm standard seems vague though
[12:19:32] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[12:19:43] <jasperdegroot> ok I read
[12:21:23] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: yes, that's exactly what we discussed
[12:21:54] <arschmitz_> ok we can discuss any naming type stuff at the meeting
[12:22:07] <arschmitz_> but that should get him to the right place that it would just be a simple name change
[12:22:20] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[12:22:40] <jasperdegroot> and I think "toolbar" for a non specific toolbar is fine
[12:22:51] <jasperdegroot> can't think of anything better
[12:35:41] <cgack> jasperdegroot: arschmitz_ what now?
[12:35:54] <arschmitz_> lol
[12:36:09] <arschmitz_> cgack: did you see my comment on the toolbar PR?
[12:37:29] <cgack> i just saw the beginning saying you were discussing over here and I just scrolled through the backlog but just want to confirm what is happening
[12:37:56] <cgack> reading the comment now
[12:38:06] <arschmitz_> cgack: sure i tried to summarize it in the comment
[12:38:29] <arschmitz_> its nothing crazy just clairification on how the roles should be handled 
[12:39:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: I am now looking at https://github.com/cgack/jquery-mobile/blob/7687-toolbar-classes-option/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L243
[12:39:41] <cgack> okay, makes sense.  so do we need to add css for ui-toolbar-toolbar to be like ui-toolbar-footer or similar
[12:40:23] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: yeah that seems messy
[12:40:45] <arschmitz_> there is awareness of fixed toolbars that should not exist
[12:40:50] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: yeah, having code in fixedToolbar.js that only should run if it's not fixed doesn't make sense
[12:40:59] <arschmitz_> nope
[12:41:16] <arschmitz_> cgack: so i dont think you need to do that
[12:41:22] <arschmitz_> ui-toolbar should be that
[12:41:23] <jasperdegroot> cgack: ui-toolbar-toolbar is kinda weird
[12:41:44] <arschmitz_> ui-toolbar-header / footer will just add whatever ( if anything ) is needed different for them
[12:41:58] <jasperdegroot> I guess ui-toolbar should contain all css that is used by all 3 types (toolbar/header/footeR)
[12:42:00] <cgack> and ui-toolbar will hold the rest
[12:42:07] <cgack> right on
[12:42:09] <jasperdegroot> ys
[12:42:12] <jasperdegroot> yes
[12:42:13] <jasperdegroot> :)
[12:42:33] <cgack> this is my favorite PR so far
[12:42:45] <jasperdegroot> lol
[12:43:02] <jasperdegroot> I am glad you like it ;)
[12:43:03] <arschmitz_> cgack: it looks like there is some logic in destroy that needs to be moved to fixedtoolbar extension too
[12:43:31] <arschmitz_> cgack: i would say the word fixed should probably not exist in toolbar.js lol
[12:44:32] <arschmitz_> cgack: though i swear you already fixed the destory stuff i see here 
[12:44:38] <arschmitz_> i must be crazy lol
[12:44:44] <cgack> what logic in destroy are you talking about, i'm only seeing the _setrelative
[12:45:11] <arschmitz_> cgack: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8114/files#diff-d08fdc724bcb00aacb41795a7921fbafR254
[12:45:31] <arschmitz_> doh
[12:45:33] <arschmitz_> im insane
[12:45:37] <arschmitz_> thats in fixedtoolbar lol
[12:45:48] <arschmitz_> my diff was expaned all weird lol
[12:46:10] <arschmitz_> cgack: so nevermind yeah just the set relative
[12:49:05] <cgack> okay I think I have it all figured... so setRelative should move to the refresh of fixedToolbar then instead of toolbar.js, plus all the business with roles
[12:49:09] <jasperdegroot> cgack: I can't comment on a line that hasn't changed but "fixed" should be removed from the label here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8114/files#diff-bb774a37f6fcf370d638d8ccbb2bf21bR10
[12:49:43] <cgack> jasperdegroot: will do. thanks
[12:49:52] <arschmitz_> cgack: no i think set relative should still be there
[12:49:56] <arschmitz_> but it should always run
[12:50:09] <arschmitz_> and the if should be in fixedtoolbar
[12:50:16] <arschmitz_> and inside the if it should call super
[12:51:57] <cgack> arschmitz_: same with updatebackbutton and the other items within the conditional inside refresh?
[12:52:16] <arschmitz_> just a sec let me look at this again
[12:53:34] <arschmitz_> ok scratch what i sai about _setRealative 
[12:53:58] <arschmitz_> cgack: all you should change
[12:54:06] <arschmitz_> is line 245
[12:54:09] <arschmitz_> should be 
[12:54:16] <arschmitz_> this._super();
[12:54:46] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: does that make sense to you
[12:55:02] <jasperdegroot> lemme look again
[12:55:18] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: in toolbar it always sets to relative but in with the fixed extension we want to overide that when its not fixed
[12:55:23] <arschmitz_> or is fixed i mean
[12:55:38] <jasperdegroot> to be honest I am still curious how we can set a page from position absolute to relative without causing issues
[12:56:05] <jasperdegroot> if we can do it in this case, whyc can't page always be relative?
[12:56:06] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: we cant we decided it was the least of the evils
[12:56:18] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: yeah I remember that discussion
[12:56:28] <arschmitz_> this is what causes the toolbar to jump in some layouts
[12:56:41] <arschmitz_> but its also what makes external non fixed footers possible at all
[12:56:45] <jasperdegroot> aha
[12:57:26] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: so we can close this ticket as won't fix: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8264 ?
[12:57:44] <arschmitz_> i wouldnt say wont fix
[12:57:49] <arschmitz_> but PR's welcome
[12:57:53] <jasperdegroot> it has fixed header but not external
[12:58:00] <arschmitz_> because if someone found a way to fix it better we are open to it
[12:58:41] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: cgack : let me take one more look at this whole setRelative thing
[12:58:59] <cgack> so another thing. are do we going to have any situation where we have ui-toolbar-fullscreen or does that option require footer/header types
[12:59:25] <arschmitz_> that requires fixedposition
[12:59:31] <arschmitz_> which requires header or footer
[13:00:19] <cgack> okay great, that's what I thought
[13:02:31] <arschmitz_> jasperdegroot: cgacki need to run but ill be back in ~1 hour
[13:02:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: ok later
[14:13:14] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: cgack : I looked into _setRelative and agree with arschmitz_ that https://github.com/cgack/jquery-mobile/blob/7687-toolbar-classes-option/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L245 should become this._super();
[14:17:04] <cgack> great, I'll work these changes and we can revisit after the next iteration
[14:21:54] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8264 has nothing to do with this though. I am still trying to figure out what makes the header disappear in that case.
