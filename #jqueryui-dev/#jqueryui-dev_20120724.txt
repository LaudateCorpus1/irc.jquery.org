[01:57:06] <jzaefferer> gnarf: nice job on the jenkins/testswarm refactoring, makes a lot more sense then one gigantic job
[01:57:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I've just added a downstream project to jQuery Core, that way the "git core" job runs after jQuery Core: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/
[01:57:30] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i thought it would be useful to split that giant task up
[01:57:40] <gnarf> jzaefferer: nice
[01:58:05] <jzaefferer> once both are more reliable, it'll be even more useful
[01:58:12] <gnarf> yeah
[01:58:42] <gnarf> i think trac is the next big pain in my butt
[01:58:52] <jzaefferer> I don't get why this failed: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/38/console
[01:59:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i reran
[01:59:04] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the fails
[01:59:31] <jzaefferer> ah, one IE9 error
[01:59:37] <jzaefferer> meh
[01:59:44] <jzaefferer> new day, same shit
[01:59:57] <gnarf> yeah - we need to figure out a way to get the output from browserstack back to junit
[02:00:36] <gnarf> i wonder if we could parse the testswarm run html in post
[02:01:15] <jzaefferer> gnarf: btw. the code.jquery.com cp thingie for QUnit may work, but the files in the index don't match: http://code.jquery.com/ -> http://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-git.js
[02:01:37] <jzaefferer> tagged it looks like this: http://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-1.9.0.js
[02:02:45] <gnarf> im not sure i follow
[02:03:08] <jzaefferer> cp qunit/* /var/www/html/code.jquery.com/qunit/git/
[02:03:10] <jzaefferer> that's in the job
[02:03:35] <jzaefferer> different path then the one advertised on qunitjs.com
[02:04:07] <gnarf> ah - yes
[02:04:10] <gnarf> we could fix that
[02:04:17] <gnarf> i believe that is what the job was doing before
[02:04:32] <gnarf> just cp the files to the right location and change the curl
[02:04:57] <jzaefferer> okay, will do
[02:05:22] <jzaefferer> along with a grunt task to put the commit sha in there

[08:36:55] <agcolom> Hi :-) who is in charge of the look and feel of the http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ site?
[08:51:22] <agcolom> kborchers: Hi, are you in charge of the look and feel of the http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ site?
[08:52:37] <agcolom> it's just that Search jQuery Mobile API Documentation is too long and is displayed on two lines.... (in the search input field)
[09:11:52] <kborchers> agcolom: i have that fixed in my local version. i am still making lots of changes but hope to merge some stuff soon
[10:33:54] <agcolom> kborchers: cool! Thanks!
[11:23:19] <beaucollins> scott_gonzalez: ping
[11:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> hey beaucollins
[11:23:36] <beaucollins> hi!
[11:23:43] <beaucollins> quick question on the user sync
[11:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:24:19] <beaucollins> the json source of users, should I assume that is going to be a local file in the dist folder
[11:25:00] <beaucollins> probably generated during build-wordpress?
[11:25:55] <beaucollins> right now I'm not making any assumptions so it could be a json file hosted on a server somewhere or a file on the local filesystem
[11:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you can write the grunt plugin to assume it lives in `grunt.config( "wordpress.dir" ) + "/users.json"`
[11:26:41] <beaucollins> ok, I can have that as the "default" and add a config of some sort if necessary
[11:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's no need to config the individual file, since the directory is configurable.
[11:27:20] <beaucollins> ok, then I'll leave that hardcoded
[11:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> That whole directory is for consumption by grunt-wordpress.
[11:27:37] <beaucollins> cool, I have what I need now to get this wrapped up
[11:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress/#directory-structure
[11:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome; thanks for working on this.
[12:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone understand what this guy is trying to say? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8457#comment:5
[13:09:42] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: are there any docs or an example of one of the packages.json I could look at. I'm assuming it's just like an npm manifest but it would be nice to have another example
[13:09:54] <johnbender> I'm working on generating them right now
[13:14:19] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ^
[13:14:23] <johnbender> same question to you
[13:18:00] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: also, does it support subdirectory file references?
[13:18:08] <johnbender> that is
[13:18:50] <johnbender> can I either reference a file in a subdirectory for the plugin, or can the plugin json be in a subdirectory? (I'm under the impression that neither of these is possible)
[16:04:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[16:04:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you might also have to tweak perms on that directory
[16:04:36] <gnarf> to give your user access
[17:54:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thoughts on this http://cl.ly/image/2n0P3f3h2p01
[17:54:28] <kborchers> the damn thing is so long it won't wrap anywhere so it gets pushed down
[17:55:40] <kborchers> the other issue is when the screen gets smaller http://cl.ly/image/2M212V2B3O3Z
[17:55:56] <kborchers> we probably need to make the font sizes more responsive. thoughts?
[17:56:23] <kborchers> ajpiano gnarf jzaefferer scott_gonzalez ^
[18:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: There's nowhere that file paths are used in the manifest files.
[18:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: It would be very helpful if you guys would read the doc that I kept linking to :-)
[18:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Yeah, maybe responsive font sizes. That's one hell of a long name.
[18:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: I also gave you the link to every single manifest file for UI: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/test-jquery-ui/tree/1.9.0
[22:18:52] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I looked at both links but it's not obvious how the file names are associated
[22:19:02] <johnbender> that is the doc and all the examples
[22:19:14] <johnbender> it's not in the doc anywhere that I can find
[22:19:46] <johnbender> I mean I know that this contradicts appearances and all but I'm not a complete idiot :/
