[04:50:47] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi
[04:50:55] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[04:53:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see my mobile base widget pr?
[04:53:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I just had a look at it
[04:53:32] <arschmitz> no more mobile base widget
[04:53:50] <uGoMobi> turned out to be a quite simple change, right?
[04:53:57] <arschmitz> yup
[04:54:03] <uGoMobi> nice
[04:54:33] <arschmitz> and no every widget thats loaded gets mobile metods automaticly
[04:54:46] <arschmitz> now*
[04:55:28] <arschmitz> the next step is the ticket i filed about namespace
[04:55:37] <uGoMobi> great
[04:55:42] <arschmitz> (much less simple change)
[04:56:13] <arschmitz> we will need to depreciate the mobile namespace though
[04:59:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what exactly makes it complex?
[05:00:16] <arschmitz> that its in about 10,000 places lol
[05:00:40] <arschmitz> so not complex per se just a lot of work i guess lol
[05:01:00] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:04:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you have any idea why we depend on enhancement order for widgets that need other widgets and dont just call them?
[05:05:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm let me think
[05:05:41] <arschmitz> i was thinking about this and _|Nix|_ registry
[05:05:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ added that
[05:05:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:06:09] <arschmitz> in ui they dont make you call draggable and resizable first if you want dialog
[05:06:22] <arschmitz> dialog calls draggable and resizable internally
[05:07:13] <arschmitz> so all the user needs to do is call dialog
[05:07:33] <uGoMobi> could it be because of initSelectors?
[05:07:42] <uGoMobi> we don't always call the plugin
[05:07:53] <uGoMobi> but just expect it to be initialized
[05:08:00] <arschmitz> right
[05:08:07] <uGoMobi> like the input in the slider widget
[05:08:10] <arschmitz> init selectors makes sense a little
[05:08:28] <arschmitz> but you can call textinput on an already enhanced textinput and it just does nothing
[05:08:36] <arschmitz> and if its not enhanced it enhances it
[05:08:44] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[05:09:07] <arschmitz> this will be weird when calling widgets stand alone to have to call 2 or 3 widgets to use 1 widget
[05:09:34] <uGoMobi> yes I agree
[05:09:42] <uGoMobi> this should be handled inside the widget
[05:09:46] <arschmitz> yup
[05:09:55] <arschmitz> this removes need for registry
[05:10:29] <arschmitz> i got thinking about this because right now every new widget will be 2 files one for the widget and one just to define init selector and add to registry
[05:10:57] <arschmitz> so i was thinking if we remove registry it fixes both these issues
[05:11:17] <arschmitz> then its just a matter of rethinking initselector
[05:11:19] <uGoMobi> yeah makes sense
[05:11:30] <arschmitz> which i was going to talk to scott about see if he has an idea for this
[05:11:56] <arschmitz> i was almost wondering if a "default" init selector might make sense
[05:12:22] <arschmitz> like :jqmDate(role='widgetname')
[05:12:56] <arschmitz> then it could be defined as part of $.Widget and will only need to be changed if you want something else
[05:13:51] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if I follow
[05:14:21] <uGoMobi> the initSelector is an option now
[05:14:23] <arschmitz> with these changes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/tabs.js would not need to exist at all the whole file could go away
[05:14:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no its not
[05:14:36] <uGoMobi> ah we changed that
[05:14:58] <arschmitz> init select cant be an option because it cant be changed per widget
[05:15:06] <arschmitz> instance
[05:15:07] <uGoMobi> right
[05:15:40] <arschmitz> basicly my goal is to remove the need for that extra file
[05:15:49] <arschmitz> for "most" widgets
[05:15:53] <uGoMobi> I understand
[05:16:31] <arschmitz> and most widgets selectors right now are jsut :jqmDate(role='widgetname') so why not make it the default 
[05:16:48] <arschmitz> and just set it if its NOT that
[05:17:37] <uGoMobi> yeah we just have some widgets where it is element names
[05:18:06] <arschmitz> yeah thoes would just override
[05:19:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - I think I remember why I didn't move the button element from button widget to buttonMarkup
[05:20:00] <arschmitz> yea??
[05:20:30] <arschmitz> i could not see a reason in code
[05:20:49] <uGoMobi> one reason is that there is additional CSS for button element
[05:20:50] <arschmitz> so iv been curious
[05:21:06] <arschmitz> ok
[05:21:33] <uGoMobi> and I was thinking we should keep button widget JS and CSS in sync
[05:21:37] <arschmitz> stuff to override the default style i assume
[05:21:54] <uGoMobi> but maybe that's not enough reason to not move it
[05:22:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:22:16] <arschmitz> yeah i think it should move because its much more link a link
[05:22:20] <uGoMobi> other thing was consistency
[05:22:48] <uGoMobi> something like .button( "option", "theme", "a" ); won't work anymore
[05:23:04] <uGoMobi> while it does work with input type="button"
[05:23:10] <arschmitz> i think the performance hit is worth change personally
[05:23:13] <arschmitz> true
[05:23:43] <uGoMobi> currently the button documentation is already messed up with buttonMarkup() stuff
[05:24:03] <arschmitz> if they wanted that though couldnt they do <button type="button">

[05:24:11] <uGoMobi> and I thought people might like it if it's just simple the same for all form button
[05:24:33] <arschmitz> which is totally valid its just implied and not required
[05:24:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have to take a closer look at the new buttonMarkup() code
[05:24:54] <uGoMobi> to see what exaclty goes on in there
[05:25:28] <uGoMobi> oh sorry, nevermind
[05:25:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i totally agree about consistancy however if someone uses a lot of buttons thats a lot of widget instances that are not really needed
[05:25:40] <uGoMobi> you mean to make it use the button widget by adding the role?
[05:25:46] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:26:23] <uGoMobi> don't you get a race condition?
[05:27:37] <arschmitz> we would add :not(button[type=button])
[05:27:56] <arschmitz> to the button markup selector
[05:28:06] <uGoMobi> yeah that would work

[05:29:13] <arschmitz> as far as docs
[05:29:18] <uGoMobi> yup
