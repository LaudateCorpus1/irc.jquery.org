[01:18:12] <robschmuecker> @uGoMobi Hi Jasper,
[01:18:34] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: hi!
[01:18:47] <robschmuecker> Quick question please! 
[01:19:03] <uGoMobi> sure
[01:19:40] <robschmuecker> Regarding all the 'alt' css tags for the icons, is the simplest way that I manually cut-paste from the appropriate output of grunt-icon?
[01:21:08] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: I think it is
[01:21:12] <robschmuecker> since I'm getting currently .ui-icon-alert-black out of grunticon and it would become .ui-icon-alt.ui-icon-alert:after
[01:21:29] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: I have done it manually too
[01:22:13] <robschmuecker> leaving the "black" off it and obviously adding the :after - ok sounds fine.  The after I can add with regex/search-replace in anycase.  Cool thanks for the headsup.  Just checking that we didn't do it some other way.
[01:22:24] <robschmuecker> thanks for the advice.  Catch you later.
[01:22:46] <uGoMobi> robschmuecker: ok thanks

[04:54:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:54:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If data-role="content" is deprecated, shouldn't page option "contentTheme" also be deprecated?
[04:54:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[04:55:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did we already deprecate data-role="content"?
[04:55:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know we talked about it
[04:55:55] <_|Nix|_> After all, if we cannot identify which div is the content (because of the missing data-role="content") we won't know to which div to apply the contentTheme option.
[04:56:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[04:56:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, arschmitz filed a bug against API to document and deprecate data-role="content".
[04:56:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are right that contentTheme should be deprecated together with data-role="content"
[04:56:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's also a note in the source for js/widgets/page.js
[04:57:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, I see it's in the changelog as well
[04:57:56] <uGoMobi> Deprecated adding aria role and classes to content and use of data-role=content you can add class .ui-content and theme and aria your self
[04:58:06] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess one of the implications of that changelog item is that the contentTheme option is also deprecated.
[04:58:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:58:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Better mark it as such, then.
[04:58:55] <uGoMobi> you shouldn't theme div.ui-content anyway
[04:59:13] <uGoMobi> because the page can be longer than the content which leaves a gap
[04:59:29] <_|Nix|_> All the better than to remove that option.
[04:59:49] <uGoMobi> yes

[07:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> So the classes option is essentially the upcoming ::part() selector for Shadow DOM.
[07:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well, maybe not.
[07:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> classes is really a replacement for a lack of mixins.
[07:15:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we deprecate data-role="content" we should update all the demos to not contain it?
[07:16:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically s/data-role="content"/class="ui-content" role="main"/
[07:16:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[07:16:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[07:16:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but... the div already has class attribute in many cases
[07:17:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, there will be fun.
[07:17:12] * _|Nix|_ cracks his knuckles
[07:17:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: mostly jqm-content
[07:17:48] <uGoMobi> sometimes also jqm-fullwidth
[07:48:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: i figured out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6500
[07:48:59] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6500 by googol7 (1mon 18h ago): iOS 7 homescreen app redirects to other page when widget gets input focus
[07:49:08] <arschmitz> its a lot of crazy coincidences 
[07:49:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can we fix it?
[07:49:49] <arschmitz> only if we figure out how to prevent click through in ios7 web apps
[07:50:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: basicly on any other page this would never happen
[07:50:32] <arschmitz> it has to be THAT page
[07:51:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well it could probably happen any time you have an input as the last element on the page AND have a nav footer
[07:51:45] <arschmitz> and are in a ios7 webview
[07:52:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are we preventing default in the correct handler and checking preventDefault in the undesirable handler?
[07:52:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nothing to do with prevent default
[07:52:47] <arschmitz> ios7 webviews will trigger a click after the focus
[07:52:58] <arschmitz> at the screen cord where it happened regardless of what is now there
[07:53:28] <arschmitz> so when you click an input and the key board pops in this specific case the footer moves to where the input was
[07:53:37] <arschmitz> and so you get a click on the toolbar
[07:54:28] <arschmitz> its an ios7 webview bug and really has nothing to do with JQM
[07:54:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Argh! Terrible! So, it's not the same event. It's a brand new event ...
[07:55:07] <arschmitz> yes and everything is working as it should
[07:55:13] <uGoMobi> pfff
[07:55:17] <arschmitz> execpt ios is triggering a click on the wrong element
[07:55:33] <arschmitz> so we get a click we nav thats what should happen
[07:56:17] <arschmitz> its the same thing that plagues vClick that the tap target and click target can be different
[07:56:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[07:56:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the best we can do is record the fact that we've had a focus at those coordinates, so expect a click and ignore it.
[07:57:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But that's a HUGE workaround.
[07:57:10] <arschmitz> just this particular case is only ios7 and only webviews and only if you have a fixed nav bar and only if the last element on the page is an input and only when you click that iput
[07:57:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[07:57:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd say, if you run into this, move your input.
[07:57:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: EXACTLY
[07:57:50] <arschmitz> this is way to specific an issue
[07:57:50] <tazle> is there a particular reason why the tooltip content function doesn't get the event object as a parameter?
[07:59:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you find out why the toolbars don't hide?
[07:59:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are you ok with me closing as wont fix?
[07:59:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they do
[07:59:47] <arschmitz> thats the whole thing
[07:59:58] <arschmitz> the select is the last element on the page
[08:00:21] <arschmitz> so when they get set to position relative to "hide" they go to that spot below the select above the keyboard
[08:00:44] <arschmitz> thats why this only happens if you click an input thats the last element on the page
[08:00:45] <uGoMobi> ah ok, gotcha
[08:00:57] <uGoMobi> I thought they didn't get the ui-fixed-hidden class
[08:01:11] <uGoMobi> to make them position absolute instead of fixed
[08:01:25] <arschmitz> huh?
[08:01:33] <arschmitz> they get that class to set them to relative
[08:02:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.fixedToolbar.css#L51
[08:02:41] <arschmitz> oh sorry your right but its the same effect either way
[08:02:58] <arschmitz> thats the bottom of the page so thats where the footer goes
[08:03:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:03:32] <uGoMobi> as a workaround people can use external fixed footer
[08:03:45] <uGoMobi> because we hide those now
[08:03:57] <arschmitz> or just put a <br/> after their input lol
[08:04:05] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[08:04:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyways, I am ok with closing as won't fix
[08:04:30] <arschmitz> cool thanks
[08:04:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: might be good to explain a bit more in comment
[08:04:52] <arschmitz> yeah i will

[08:28:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, on the content.
[08:28:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, let me check
[08:28:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't get it. The toolbar and the content do not need any corner classes. Only the popup needs ui-corner-all, no?
[08:29:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's correct
[08:29:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll change it to be like that.
[08:29:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just checked without ui-corner-bottom class and it looks fine
[08:30:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the popup CSS has rules to make content and toolbars inherit the applicable border-radius
[08:30:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, so we no longer need that.
[08:30:41] <uGoMobi> (or maybe those rules are in core.css)
[08:30:48] <uGoMobi> yup, don't need them
[08:33:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I managed to do it by hand.

[11:16:47] <rxaviers> I dont have a previous opinion about it. But, it seems like you are removing the default round-style of this widget. So, I am wondering about other elements. I still see `ui-corner-all` on other widgets.

[11:44:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is the new style viewable on a page (e.g. stage?)
[11:44:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is it OK if I add return this to the end of pagecontainer's go() method?
[11:44:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and forward that to back() and forward()?
[11:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: There are no staging servers for code projects, but there is the view server. Not sure why it hasn't updated yet though.
[11:45:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm documenting the methods and it makes sense.
[11:45:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im fine with that
[11:45:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait. NM ...
[11:45:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i was wondering the same
[11:45:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ?
[11:45:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Methods that return undefined return this from the widget factory or the plugin or whatever.
[11:45:44] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks. 
[11:45:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The bridge.
[11:45:46] <arschmitz> why it hasent updated
[11:45:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://view.jqueryui.com/ will show a "menu-style" branch once it is updted
[11:45:54] <uGoMobi> updated*
[11:45:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[11:46:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that should update every 5 minutes
[11:46:21] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh great! Thanks!
[11:53:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: How come a method that has a parameter results in an example call that has no parameters? http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/proxy/browse.php?u=http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/#method-go
[11:54:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I've tried specifying an example-value on the <argument>, but to no avail.
[11:55:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. NM. Using includes/widgets-method-option.xml as an example.
[12:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/menu-style/demos/menu/icons.html
[12:01:14] <scott_gonzalez> There was a stuck lockfile.
[12:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> Compare to http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menu/icons.html
[12:03:41] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: hover style looks much better this way
[12:05:29] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: maybe nice if the spacing between the left icons and the border is the same as the space between the right arrow and the border
[12:06:26] <uGoMobi> oh wait, it's probably the same
[12:06:50] <uGoMobi> it's just that the icon itself is smaller
[12:11:25] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: you could add .ui-menu .ui-menu { margin-left: -1px; } to collapse the border of the menu and nested menu
[12:13:42] <uGoMobi> anyways, I like the changes you made
[12:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Looks like the current styling actually overlaps them a bit. I must've lost that when I reduced everything.
[12:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add the -1px.
[12:13:54] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'm back
[12:14:02] <gseguin> release anytime
[12:14:21] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am writing a blog post now
[12:14:45] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez:i like new style better
[12:15:32] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but you can go ahead with release
[12:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..actually margins don't do anything here because the position plugin handles the actual location.
[12:16:24] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ah, I see that now. If you set margin -1px it just increases the left offset with 1px
[12:16:43] <gseguin> ok
[12:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: This made me notice that the existing margin-top isn't doing anything.
[12:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> So that can just go away.
[12:17:18] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[12:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: I can just adjust the default position settings in the JS to do the 1px move.

[13:29:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and what about back, forward, and go?
[13:29:28] <arschmitz> yeah anything that is a replacement for something deprecated
[13:29:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Should I leave those undocumented?
[13:29:38] <arschmitz> no those dont replace anything
[13:29:48] <arschmitz> so yes leave them undocumented for now i think
[13:30:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:30:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, I dunno how we ended up with a page option named "keepNative" ... we never had such an option in page.
[13:30:57] <arschmitz> we documented to set it on the prototype
[13:31:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We had keepNativeDefault and we had method keepNativeSelector(), but never an option keepNative.
[13:31:02] <arschmitz> for some stupid reason
[13:31:10] <arschmitz> so it ended up in somehow as an option
[13:31:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's documented as an option, but it doesn't exist as an option ...
[13:31:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... I think I'll just remove it.
[13:33:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The fact that it's in such disarray tells me that it's not really in use much.
[13:36:07] <arschmitz> it should be documented deprecated incase some one is using it
[13:36:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't believe we ever consult $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNative
[13:37:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll check 1.3-stable as well, to be sure.
[13:37:15] <arschmitz> its somewhere either in old demos or a random api mention or something
[13:37:23] <arschmitz> i cant remember where but it was out there
[13:37:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: F0rk ... probably a typo. It was probably supposed to be keepNativeDefault ...
[13:37:58] <arschmitz> yeah 
[13:38:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and it DID work in 1.3 
[13:38:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... super weird, because that means we should have code for it in 1.4 ...
[13:39:11] <arschmitz> we do im pretty sure
[13:39:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, and actually I think I'm the one responsible for having removed it ... :/
[13:39:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I remember writing code to track whether keepNative has changed as a result of mobileinit.
[13:39:57] <arschmitz> yeah its in there
[13:40:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And I had to write the same code to track whether keepNativeDefault has changed as a result of mobileinit.

[13:40:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, man ... what a mess ... it's not declared in options: {}
[13:41:07] <arschmitz> never was
[13:41:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright, well, they're both deprecated. Good riddance!
[13:41:25] <arschmitz> yup
[13:41:42] <_|Nix|_> Fffff ... aaah! *wave*
[13:41:45] <arschmitz> when i re wrote page i ran into all that and was just like WTF deprecated all of it deprecated
[13:42:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why does that remind me of that part from Game Of Thrones where the guy describes that dragony king wanting to burn the whole city?
[13:42:44] <arschmitz> lol
[13:43:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's funny when you think about it. It's a perfect description of what we're gonna do right after we release 1.4.
[13:44:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only that which we have not marked as deprecated shall survive the fire of post-release removal.

[20:23:50] <TNG_25> what is the difference anyway ?
