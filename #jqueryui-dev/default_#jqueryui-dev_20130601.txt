[12:35:43] <Testtube> Afternoon guys. I am attempting to use the calendar widget which i have implemented how do i get the results of the calendar entry in order to post the data to a mysql backend?
[12:40:27] <shoky> Testtube: you'll have better luck in #jquery
[12:41:10] <Testtube> Just noticed the topic. Thanks I think i am going to continue a bit more googling before bothering anyone else
[13:29:50] <Frantic> hey guys, could someone tell me if jqueyui's .position is supposed to work to position element A relative to element B when they are both children of a position: relative container?
[13:30:21] <Frantic> I'm asking because I get strange behaviour and I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or it's just not supposed to do that, as I understand how it could be hard to implement.
[13:33:25] <Frantic> btw, the strange behaviour: when running .position in $().ready(), it positions the elements as if the parent wasn't relative, so they have offsets relative to window, but due to the relative parent, they are shifted
[13:33:53] <Frantic> but if I then re-run the same function, but on a $("button").click(), it works as expected, and generates offsets relative to the relative parent
[14:24:05] <afahim_> Hi i have a question!  I have text within a paragraph. each sentence is in a span element
[14:24:05] <afahim_> I want to be able to replace one sentence with another one which is hidden
[14:24:05] <afahim_> I want to do it such that when I click on a sentence
[14:24:05] <afahim_> it slides out from the bottom, out of view
[14:24:05] <afahim_> while the other text this sentence is being replaced with
[14:24:05] <afahim_> slides in in its place
[14:24:05] <afahim_> anyone have an idea how I can do this?
[14:24:06] <afahim_> i've tried a lot w/ slidetoggle / toggle / etc but it hasn't been much help
[14:24:06] <afahim_> thanks :)
[15:07:52] <tj_vantoll> I never realized how many classes datepicker used. Documenting this is taking longer than expected.
