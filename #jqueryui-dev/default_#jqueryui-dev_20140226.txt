[05:44:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7112 would be nice if things like that were also noticed by the linter
[06:02:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well a jslinter is never going to find issues in css
[06:03:28] <arschmitz> there are tools which attempt to verify css though
[06:03:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I mean the require JS css build tool we use
[06:03:52] <uGoMobi> we don't use css linter, I know
[06:04:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you already in Austria?
[06:04:15] <arschmitz> yeah thats just a build tool though that does not verify anything thats what linters are for
[06:04:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i dont leave for a few hours
[06:04:31] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:05:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought require JS had some optimize options, but you are right it isn't a linter
[06:05:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: require js also does not handle css
[06:05:48] <arschmitz> we do that based on the pragmas as part of our build process
[06:09:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure I understand. this are require JS options, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L324
[06:10:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats a task
[06:11:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right, with on the next line options
[06:12:15] <uGoMobi> like remove comments yes/no, etc.
[06:13:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyways, it's clear to me that we can't use it as a css linter
[06:13:45] <arschmitz> right 
[06:14:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: didn't we already discuss the use of a CSS linter like https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-csslint ?
[06:15:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thatsnot a require task or options
[06:15:13] <arschmitz> thats a special task we made called css build

[07:52:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Interesting: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7091 ... what exactly is the meaning of addBackBtn when the header is outside the page? I'm not surprised it breaks :)
[07:55:36] <_|Nix|_> We might want to make the decision as to whether to add a back button irrespective of whether the toolbar is on a page or not.
[07:56:18] <_|Nix|_> Like, if ( $.mobile.urlHistory.stack.length > 0 && $.mobile.urlHistory.activeIndex > 0 ) {
[07:56:27] <_|Nix|_> this._addBackBtn(); }
[07:56:35] <_|Nix|_> Or something like that.
[07:56:44] <_|Nix|_> ... of course, without any of the deprecated stuff.
[07:58:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not too sure what to do about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7174 ... the flipswitch wasn't really designed to stretch to 100% ... 
[07:58:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Might be best to add a CSS rule to exclude .ui-checkboxradio from the rule mentioned by the OP.
[08:00:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re: back button. Ideally the external toolbar gets updated after a page change.
[08:02:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe it shouldn't even be part of toolbar, but a feature on its own
[08:06:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not a bad idea at all!
[08:07:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then the toolbar widget would simply depend on this other widget.
[08:10:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just make it an extension to button
[08:10:12] <arschmitz> that makes it hide on the first page
[08:10:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, that sounds like a good idea
[08:11:37] <_|Nix|_> There's a wrinkle though ... an anchor is usually enough, so you don't need a button widget, and it may need to be removed from the DOM when it's the first page, because if it's present and hidden, it may mess up the left button/right button styling of the header.
[08:11:38] <arschmitz> then it has nothign to do with toolbar
[08:12:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ancors get auto enhanced in toolbar
[08:12:27] <arschmitz> so its always a button 
[08:12:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: didn't we deprecate that?
[08:12:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's deprecated.
[08:12:43] <arschmitz> and it does not even need to be an extension just something that you can call on a button
[08:12:51] <arschmitz> that makes it hide on the first page
[08:13:19] <uGoMobi> but I agree this should be independent from toolbar
[08:13:28] <_|Nix|_> A jQuery plugin may be enough.
[08:13:30] <arschmitz> or just remove the functionality completely
[08:14:30] <arschmitz> anyway i gotta run to finish packing
[08:14:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Didn't we have a bug about a sticky :hover state as you navigate? Is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6869 that bug, or is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6869 a duplicate of that bug?
[08:14:40] <uGoMobi> it's nice for apps where you don't have a browser back button
[08:14:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: safe travels!
[08:14:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, have a safe trip.
[08:16:21] <uGoMobi> since a link button doesn't require a widget we can look into something that just provides the correct href and a way to hide the link or button if there is no previous page
[08:17:05] <jqcommit> [13themeroller.jquerymobile.com] 15dennisr2000 opened issue #176: Theme "d" incorrectly applying to body 02http://git.io/qP9Tkw
[08:17:11] <uGoMobi> basically the same as a close button for a popup which you have to add in your markup yourself as well
[08:19:03] <uGoMobi> but this would be something for a future version of course, so that doesn't solve the problem for now
[08:20:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you think of a workaround for that external toolbar back button issue?
[08:20:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7174 - I will look into that issue today
[08:25:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6869 - Looks like they are talking about the active state for which we add a class, not the :hover or :active (down) state for which we now use pseudo classes
[08:25:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My first thought is to render the decision to show/hide page-independent.
[08:25:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I reproduced it with browserstack, and the :hover was sticky, not the ui-btn-active.
[08:25:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe you were looking for this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6248
[08:26:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - that's also :hover.
[08:32:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's ask for a test page to avoid confusion
[08:33:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the OP also doesn't mention the platform/browser he tested on
[08:34:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Or they can confirm it's the same issue as 6248 (which has a test page) so we can close as duplicate
[08:47:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7185#issuecomment-36146273 :/
[08:47:38] <uGoMobi> I do not understand :)
[08:58:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: looking
[09:02:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I made a test page, but that only exhibits a sticky :hover state - not ui-btn-active.
[09:02:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/298 ...
[09:03:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not sure what we can do about :hover ... I think that's a bug in the browser ... although I'm not surprised, because we're not /really/ navigating to another page. It's merely the link beneath the mouse pointer that is changing.
[09:08:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I don't think it's a browser bug, but intentional behaviour implemented by mobile browsers
[09:09:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It doesn't make sense to me though. There's no concept of hover when you don't have a real mouse pointer.
[09:10:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can conclude that the mouse must be "hovering" somewhere based on the fact that not too long ago there was a click there, but once you've established the element above which it was hovering, who is to say that the hovering applies to the next element that ends up under the mouse pointer?
[09:10:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's legacy behaviour from the days when there /was/ a real mouse pointer.
[09:13:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=248392
[09:13:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see the comments about "long press hover hack"
[09:15:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: bottom line is that this is native browser behaviour and not something we do in the library
[09:16:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - that's what I thought ...
[09:16:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: question is if we should add an ugly hack to change this behaviour
[09:16:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't immediately see how we could ...
[09:17:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we shouldn't although this native behaviour seems a bit odd when using multipage template
[09:17:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think it depends on whether you're using multipage or not ... I think it also happens when you Ajax.
[09:18:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The bottom line is that one link slides out from underneath the "pointer", and another slides in under it.
[09:18:35] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I restarted that build. Might have been an issue with coveralls 'cause I don't see anything in there that would have decrease coverage
[09:18:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That makes sense with a real mouse, but not with touch.
[09:18:51] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thanks!
[09:21:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah you're right, it's not only with multipage template
[09:21:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and that other ticket was about hover state during scrolling
[09:22:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what would happen if you trigger a mouseup event? (like I said, ugly hack)
[09:22:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You'd have to figure out which element ends up under the pointer after the transition completes.
[09:23:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and mouseup may not be the right event, because, after all, mouseup does not move the mouse, so it's still "hovering" above the new element.
[09:37:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true, looks like there isn't a simple way to do this
[09:40:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only thing I can think of is when we add a class if it's not a touch device and scope hover styles to that class, but then we change native behaviour in general and not only in case of this issue
[09:40:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and there is the problem of properly detection if it's a touch device
[09:40:52] <uGoMobi> s/detection/detecting/
[09:42:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... I'd say forget it.
[09:43:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I would argue that, when embracing touch, you have to rip all code out of the browser that assumes a mouse pointer.
[09:43:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's nothing special about a mouse pointer anymore.

[13:14:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi: just a simple one if you have a chance: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/278
[13:14:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, just it
[13:15:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I was wondering if we use that inline style in other entries as well
[13:15:26] <uGoMobi> didn't do a search yet
[13:15:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: did you check?
[13:16:00] <agcolom> I did in the past and thought I had replaced them all! 
[13:16:26] <agcolom> Must have gone through all entries but missed this one as it's in pages
[13:16:35] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[13:18:26] <agcolom> just searched and all seems ok
[13:19:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I searched too :)
[13:19:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: just commented on the PR
[13:19:09] <agcolom> did you find anything?
[13:19:13] <uGoMobi> nope
[13:19:20] <agcolom> good ;-)
[13:19:31] <agcolom> Thanks!

[13:49:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Try http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/300 on a mobile device. It behaves exactly like a desktop device, but only if you click on one of the buttons.
[13:50:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That makes sense. It behaves exactly as if there was a mouse pointer, only the mouse pointer icon is completely transparent.
[13:50:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Definitely the browser's fault.
[13:56:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice test page :_
[13:56:59] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:03:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is there a web-ui-fw tomorrow morning?

[22:55:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We /are/ having a meeting in a few - sorry! missed your message :/
[22:55:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, thanks
[22:56:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so NM.
[22:56:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's tomorrow.
[22:56:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wll
[22:56:12] <uGoMobi> oops
[22:56:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They have a meeting today.
[22:56:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will be around
[22:56:39] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[22:58:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: We can talk a bit about removing style options tomorrow, to get things started
[22:58:37] <_|Nix|_> For sure!
[22:59:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll try to come up with a fix for this back-button-on-external-toolbar issue that is not too intrusive, so that we can put it in 1.4.x.
[23:00:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice!

[23:54:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Can I assign this one to you https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6951?
[23:54:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: buttonMarkup strips a class
[23:56:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[23:56:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we have an issue about supporting in-page anchors?
[23:56:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[23:56:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because I just found https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7166, and it would be a duplicate of that issue.
[23:57:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am pretty sure we have a (feature request) ticket for that
[23:57:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you are talking about deeplinking, right?
[23:57:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, were we planning on re-adding support for in-page anchors in 1.5.0, right?
[23:57:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but only local deep-linking.
[23:58:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: It's on the roadmap (http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/) for 1.5
[23:58:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, good. I'll answer that and close the ticket as a feature request.
[23:59:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can probably use the code that arschmitz wrote to make this work in the demos already (quick links menu)
