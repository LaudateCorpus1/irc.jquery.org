[09:39:30] * rworth posted status
[10:28:06] <gnarf> okay
[10:28:09] <gnarf> this one is bugging me
[10:28:23] <gnarf> kborchers rworth / anyone around - help me with a sane solution to this problem
[10:28:46] <gnarf> setting elem.style.color = 'inherit' throws an error in IE6&7
[10:29:00] <gnarf> my options as i see them
[10:29:34] <gnarf> wrapping the elem.style.color = value in a try{ ... } catch(e) {}
[10:30:45] <gnarf> detecting the problem with support test and then try/catch the assignment (which seems like a lot of extra bytes)
[10:30:59] <gnarf> or ignore that the problem exists, and just switch my unit test to use "auto"
[10:35:40] <kborchers> gnarf: hmmm, i can't think of anything else so would probably go with option #1 :/
[10:36:07] <gnarf> option #1 scares me
[10:36:14] <gnarf> I see that pattern and cringe
[10:36:25] <kborchers> yeah ... thus the :/
[11:10:33] <nacin> gnarf: rworth: how can I help?
[11:11:54] <gnarf> nacin: at this point, the front end cache is my main priority - but I'm pretty sure I have everything I need at the moment
[11:12:01] <gnarf> i just need to get it done
[11:12:07] <rworth> nacin where are we at with the install script?
[11:12:22] <nacin> it works, just needs to become better.
[11:12:44] <rworth> how do you run it?
[11:12:53] <nacin> rename install-disabled.php to install.php.
[11:13:21] <rworth> is anything custom needed in wp-config.php ?
[11:13:31] <nacin> there are no instructions yet because it's in flux
[11:13:47] <nacin> rworth: there is a wp-config-sample.php in web-base-template
[11:24:46] <rworth> nacin can you take another look at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/34 ?
[11:24:47] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[11:25:22] <nacin> rworth: sounds good.
[11:25:45] <nacin> rworth: it would be easier if I just modified the redirect for now, I think.
[11:25:59] <rworth> worksforme
[11:26:55] <nacin> rworth: done
[11:28:31] <rworth> sweet http://stage.jquerymobile.com/ thanks nacin
[11:29:11] <rworth> can we make /resources/ a valid page name? http://stage.jquerymobile.com/resources/
[11:29:22] <rworth> or does that complicate things too much?
[11:37:05] <ajpiano> nacin, i'm about to try out your install stuff
[11:37:11] <ajpiano> cause i happen to be setting up a brand new env
[11:37:40] <nacin> rworth: yes, give me a bit.
[11:37:48] <nacin> ajpiano: cool. I wish you luck. drink first.
[11:37:52] <ajpiano> haha
[11:38:36] <ajpiano> nacin: should i just rename wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php and fill in my db values and such, and then rename the install file?
[11:38:51] <nacin> ajpiano: yes and yes but also move wp-config.php up one directory
[11:39:01] <ajpiano> i already replaced wp-content with a symlink to web-base-template.......or was that a bad idea
[11:39:10] <nacin> no symlinks. PHP hates symlinks.
[11:39:34] <ajpiano> from glancing at the config file, it looks like what i want to do is leave wp-content alone and then clone web-base-template directly into the wordpress dir
[11:39:44] <nacin> right. you don't need to replace wp-content — WordPress supports renamed content directories.
[11:39:52] <ajpiano> mmkay
[11:42:49] <gnarf> I kinda wanna setup a virtualbox VM for you guys
[11:43:05] <gnarf> that mirrors our live environment
[11:43:58] <koopersmith> gnarf: that would be awesome. We've been talking about whipping up a generic one for wp development / testing.
[11:44:35] <gnarf> koopersmith: it makes too much sense anymore to cart little VMs rather than try to massage MAMP or whatever
[11:45:14] <ajpiano> nacin: do i leave the newly-renamed install.php inside of web-base-template
[11:45:15] <ajpiano> ?
[11:45:40] <koopersmith> gnarf: MAMP's just needy
[11:45:58] <nacin> ajpiano: yes, it's fine as is.
[11:46:22] <ajpiano> nacin: so then how do i run it :p
[11:46:34] <nacin> ajpiano: go to the URL for your install
[11:46:42] <nacin> once wp-config.php is in place next to web-base-template
[11:46:57] <ajpiano> that page just comes up blank
[11:47:28] <nacin> :/
[11:47:30] <nacin> error logs?
[11:49:29] <ajpiano> hmm looks like permission denied to db
[11:49:30] <ajpiano> odd
[11:55:30] <ajpiano> nope that wasn't it
[11:55:43] <ajpiano> if i have no wp-config.php, then i get the "there's no wp-config"
[11:55:59] <ajpiano> but well, that doesn't actually prove anything, does it
[11:58:06] <nacin> ajpiano: give me a few and I'll run through it myself
[11:58:24] <ajpiano> ok
[12:32:09] <ajpiano> nacin: is there some expectation that i've named my host a particular thing?
[12:32:43] <nacin> ajpiano: actually, yes, which may be your problem, but I also think I broke install.php with config.php
[12:32:50] <ajpiano> yea i was about to say
[12:32:57] <ajpiano> i think it's hitting the die on line 46
[12:33:01] <ajpiano> in config.php
[12:33:45] <ajpiano> yeah, domain mapping issue
[12:33:59] <ajpiano> coulda just viewed source i guess but adding echo("WAT") did the job
[12:33:59] <ajpiano> :|
[12:34:36] <ajpiano> i had myself setup such that jqnetwork.dev was the name of where i was doing my local dev
[12:37:53] <ajpiano> nacin: what "should" it be
[12:38:08] <nacin> ajpiano: dev.$host
[12:38:15] <nacin> so dev.plugins.jquery.com
[12:38:37] <ajpiano> so i need to like, set my hosts file to resolve jquery.com to my local machine
[12:38:41] <ajpiano> ?
[12:42:35] <ajpiano> oh intersting...
[12:43:23] <ajpiano> with the hosts change in place, i can hit dev.learn.jquery.com and "It works!"
[12:44:45] <ajpiano> michelled: ... can you fix your connection :|
[12:46:52] <ajpiano> nacin: but obviously no tables or whatever have been created yet
[12:47:12] <ajpiano> i can buzz off for a bit until you're ready though :p
[12:47:31] <nacin> ajpiano: about to look at it now.
[12:47:58] <nacin> ajpiano: do you have wp-config, wordpress, and web-base-template all next to each other, or do you have web-base-template inside wordpress?
[12:48:02] <ajpiano> nacin: great
[12:48:17] <ajpiano> um, i don't have "wordpress"
[12:48:25] <ajpiano> i mean, i do, but it's the "top level"
[12:48:58] <ajpiano> i have a fresh 3.4 unzipped into a folder called "jqnetwork", with wp-config and web-base-template inside of it
[12:49:40] <ajpiano> i assume from what you've just said what i want is a toplevel folder called "jqnetwork" with a fresh 3.4 as "wordpress", wp-config, and web-base-template ?
[12:53:07] <ajpiano> i now have what i just described
[12:53:43] <nacin> ajpiano: I will need to go back and re-read my last conversation with scott_gonzalez, but I think we planned to support the setup you just moved *from* even though in production, we'll be running the setup you just moved *to*
[12:53:58] <ajpiano> ok, i'm happy with either
[12:54:17] <ajpiano> i just want to get up and running to the extent i can work on the grunt side of things for learn.jquery
[12:54:40] <nacin> I'm running our weekly meeting in about 6 minutes but I'm also trying to set this up — will make sure I get to it today and soon
[12:55:28] <ajpiano> ok, ping me if you need anything
[13:06:25] <gnarf> ajpiano: would you prefer I gave you my jq03.stage.jquery.com virtual machine? :)
[13:07:08] <gnarf> i need to make a smaller one at some point
[13:07:17] <gnarf> cuz its like 1.6 gig or something
[13:07:26] <gnarf> and it could be a lot trimmer
[13:10:02] <ajpiano> .... maybe
[13:10:03] <ajpiano> ?
[13:10:21] <ajpiano> i imagine it might take awhile to get me that 1.6gb
[13:10:26] <ajpiano> but then at least it would be working :p
[13:27:07] <ajpiano> gnarf: where can i get it :p
[13:27:24] <gnarf> ajpiano: lemme find someplace to put it
[13:27:31] <gnarf> so
[13:27:32] <gnarf> also
[13:27:38] <gnarf> lemme see if I can make a smaller clone
[13:27:55] <ajpiano> gnarf:  theoretically i could also make a new vm
[13:28:01] <ajpiano> and then run all your puppet scripts on it
[13:28:02] <ajpiano> right?
[13:28:18] <gnarf> ajpiano: yesh - i just don't remember how to get puppet to do that "localy"
[13:28:25] <gnarf> ajpiano: if you do, use debian
[13:28:43] <ajpiano> mmkay
[13:30:24] <ajpiano> i feel like i just keep trading one devil for another :p
[13:32:22] <rworth> ajpiano you can get quite a ways just grunt deploy'ing to stage.learn.jquery.com
[13:32:43] <rworth> not to discourage you from getting a local setup, but unless you're doing working in web-base-template atm
[13:33:04] <rworth> you can really do all the content work/grunt-wordpress work with the remote server
[13:33:05] <ajpiano> do i have to commit to deploy?
[13:33:08] <rworth> no
[13:33:46] <ajpiano> hmm, if i can just ssh onto that box then i should be good in that case
[13:34:04] <rworth> why would you need to ssh in?
[13:34:20] <ajpiano> so i can use sshfs to edit the files
[13:34:30] <ajpiano> seems like a weird place to work
[13:34:40] <rworth> you edit the files locally, then grunt deploy them to stage.learn.jquery.com
[13:34:46] <rworth> it's the staging server, after all
[13:34:49] <rworth> no need to ssh
[13:35:06] <ajpiano> will grunt deploy work
[13:35:11] <rworth> yes
[13:35:12] <ajpiano> if the grunt itself isn't there
[13:35:20] <ajpiano> like, the rest of that task isn't built out yet
[13:35:40] <rworth> let me try something
[13:36:53] <rworth> easiest way forward is set up nanoc to output files into a folder called /page/ at the top-level
[13:37:03] <rworth> the use package.json and grunt.js from qunitjs.com
[13:37:11] <rworth> and grunt deploy will 'just work'
[13:37:36] <rworth> (you'll need a config.json that has the stage url, un, pw)
[13:38:45] <ajpiano> i don't know what what un/pw is
[13:39:21] <gnarf> rworth: is that just his username and password for wordpress?
[13:39:35] <rworth> gnarf I've just been using the main one
[13:39:42] <rworth> gave it to him via pm
[13:40:08] <gnarf> rworth: okay - curious if we can get that using individual usernames/passwords
[13:40:20] <gnarf> but i suppose one central works
[13:40:34] <rworth> we could, but then we have to make sure every user has permissions on every site
[13:40:39] <rworth> as new users and new sites are created
[13:40:41] <ajpiano> rworth: i assume you mean dev.learn.jquery.com
[13:40:49] <rworth> stage.learn.jquery.com
[13:40:52] <rworth> dev. would be local
[13:40:55] <ajpiano> stage is a vestige?
[13:41:10] <ajpiano> well then, i don't think stage.learn.jquery.com is running wordpress...
[13:41:40] <rworth> is it not the same box as all the other stage. wordpress sites?
[13:41:56] <ajpiano> donno
[13:41:58] <rworth> or is it just because I have pointed at that box with my /etc/hosts
[13:41:59] <ajpiano> danheberden: ^^ ?
[13:42:05] <rworth> gnarf ^^ ?
[13:42:42] <rworth> ajpiano I've got 205.186.144.58 in my hosts for stage.learn.jquery.com
[13:42:53] <ajpiano> ohhh
[13:42:55] <ajpiano> i don't
[13:42:58] <danheberden> it never ran wp vefore
[13:43:01] <danheberden> *Before
[13:43:10] <danheberden> but i don't know what's up as of late with it
[13:43:12] <rworth> this is the new one, on the new wp stage box
[13:43:25] <rworth> I forgot the old new one had the same name :/
[13:43:26] <gnarf> rworth ajpiano - yeah - if you want the "stage." urls for jq03.stage you need to manually enter them in hosts
[13:43:28] <danheberden> yeah, the current dns resolves to a dif ip
[13:43:42] <gnarf> which I'm kinda okay keeping
[13:43:43] <gnarf> :)
[13:43:57] <gnarf> we could just distribute a "hosts block"
[13:44:10] <gnarf> for all those staging things
[13:44:17] <danheberden> or offer a dns server
[13:44:20] <danheberden> for our own use
[13:44:33] <danheberden> hosts block would def be easier though
[13:44:36] <ajpiano> ah, ok, found wordpress there
[13:44:40] <ajpiano> at 205...
[13:45:31] <ajpiano> gnarf:  which of these would be best to grab http://virtualboxes.org/images/debian/
[13:46:56] <gnarf> none
[13:46:59] <gnarf> you want squeeze
[13:47:14] <gnarf> Lemme finish this clone
[13:47:16] <ajpiano> kk
[13:47:17] <ajpiano> np
[13:47:17] <gnarf> and I can upload it
[13:47:31] <gnarf> I'll put it in dropbox
[13:47:49] <gnarf> and share over to you
[13:48:05] <ajpiano> sounds like a plan
[13:53:54] <kborchers> rworth: i have to head out. if you have anything for me, just throw it in an e-mail. otherwise i'll be available after about 8 or 8:30 your time tonight or tomorrow
[13:56:24] <rworth> kborchers thanks, talk to you then
[14:00:40] <gnarf> you know the worst part about working on this shit btw
[14:00:53] <gnarf> waiting for shit to install - again - is really time consuming
[14:00:59] <gnarf> :)
[14:05:10] <gnarf> hey nacin - if you get a minute - could you evaluate/review http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nginx-proxy-cache-integrator/installation/ for us?  Does it look like what we want, cuz it sounds/looks good to me.
[14:06:02] <nacin> are you using apache?
[14:07:30] <nacin> thought we were just sticking to nginx.
[14:07:38] <gnarf> we are
[14:07:50] <gnarf> i don't think the apache section is relavent
[14:07:54] <gnarf> but as the front-end proxy cache
[14:08:08] <gnarf> it seems this plugin installs some headers on some things in wordpress that shouldn't get cached
[14:08:44] <nacin> Did I send you a gist already?
[14:09:35] <gnarf> if you did - in my cpu move i have misplaced the link (its not in my servers notepad)
[14:09:47] <gnarf> I remember looking at one
[14:11:37] <FJ1> will there be an other pre release of 1.9 (m9 or something)?
[14:12:42] <nacin> gnarf: okay, I will dig one up.
[14:12:59] <gnarf> looking at the nginx portion of this
[14:13:05] <gnarf> its basically excatly what i expected
[14:13:24] <gnarf> short of whatever the new cookie names/etc might be
[14:13:26] <nacin> do you want to leverage nginx microcaching?
[14:14:43] <gnarf> i haven't done much research on it, but if its good lets do it :)
[14:15:30] <gnarf> also, i seem to remember the last config i looked at being more like on the same machine
[14:15:42] <gnarf> whereas we have dedicated proxy frontends
[14:15:58] <gnarf> i just wanna cache all static requests
[14:16:16] <gnarf> enforcing gzip and stuffs too
[14:18:06] <ajpiano> rworth, trying to run the grunt deploy right now
[14:18:25] <ajpiano> but it's blowing up inside of build--pages, somewhere inside of pygmentize
[14:19:04] <ajpiano> http://fixee.org/paste/1v64t19/
[14:19:14] <ajpiano> also, i had to install all the npm modules with -g :/
[14:19:54] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer , if you're around ^^
[14:21:34] <rworth> ajpiano hey
[15:20:42] <ajpiano> just leaving this here to pick up async w you rworth
[15:20:50] <ajpiano> got a lot further, but now wordpress-validate is failing
[15:20:57] <ajpiano> >> Error: Unknown XML-RPC tag 'TITLE'
[15:21:22] <nacin> gnarf: I wonder if it is a good idea to have proxy frontends set up for launch. is it really needed? seems like a good idea to adjust to scale eventually, but doing this all at once, I dunno.
[15:22:30] <gnarf> nacin: it seems like something very simple to setup that will save us a good amount of cpu power by completely avoiding php
[15:23:05] <nacin> gnarf: right, but you can do that all with one server. you don't need a proxy frontend to achieve that.
[15:23:25] <gnarf> and considering one or two of these sites can barely coexist at full load (docs sites) on the server they are already on
[15:23:33] <gnarf> it also ensures scalability
[15:23:38] <gnarf> and whats the risk?
[15:24:04] <gnarf> just the overhead of researching and setting it up?
[15:24:15] <nacin> mostly. but also, it's likely overkill.
[15:24:45] <nacin> those docs sites could scale easily with microcaching. a frontend proxy won't help, as everything will just be forwarded to WordPress anyway.
[15:25:07] <gnarf> why? people don't normally log into api
[15:25:29] <gnarf> you get 1/2000th of the requests for / if you receive 2000 requests for / in a minute
[15:25:38] <gnarf> but i suppose microcaching helps there?
[15:25:47] <nacin> that's exactly what microcaching is, yes
[15:25:52] <nacin> I thought you plan to cache static assets only at the nginx level, like images, css, js?
[15:26:04] <gnarf> output pages should be cached too
[15:26:10] <gnarf> at least for a reasonable duration
[15:26:10] <nacin> right, but in different ways.
[15:26:42] <nacin> you wouldn't actually "cache" static assets — you'd just serve them right off of disk, adding on some expires headers.
[15:27:19] <gnarf> well in a proxy_cache you would still cache them
[15:27:23] <gnarf> but yes
[15:27:26] <nacin> load balancing nginx across multiple proxy frontends only really helps when you'll be dealing with more requests per second than a single nginx server can handle. and I don't think that is the case. maybe it is, but I doubt it.
[15:27:29] <gnarf> to transfer them to the local disk
[15:27:57] <gnarf> danheberden: you lurking?
[15:28:09] <gnarf> do you have any realistic numbers for the requests per second that hit our domains?
[15:28:20] <nacin> I usually set up microcaching for something small, like 3 or 10 seconds. but you could easily set it to be 5 minutes for your docs sites, let's say.
[15:28:56] <gnarf> nacin: all I know is that we want to avoid over-taxing the "single wordpress" server because we already have 4 taxxed wordpress servers
[15:28:59] <nacin> regardless, not saying that a proxy frontend is bad. but I would just borrow the WP-specific rules from the gist I sent you (I can find it again if you didn't find it) and you're good to go.
[15:29:11] <nacin> running apache.
[15:29:14] <gnarf> so a frontend proxy cache in my opinion alleviates a huge chunk of that
[15:29:19] <gnarf> nacin: truth
[15:29:23] <nacin> apache sucks.
[15:29:36] <gnarf> the fact that we have 2 of them is just like proof of scalability
[15:29:44] <gnarf> we might only need one and reclaim the second
[15:30:16] <gnarf> but i still think having the proxy cache is a good "protective" step to the slashdot effect
[15:30:34] <danheberden> gnarf: 932748.7 pageviews a day
[15:30:48] <gnarf> danheberden: network wide
[15:30:48] <nacin> danheberden: pageviews or individual HTTP request hits?
[15:30:49] <gnarf> ?
[15:31:05] <danheberden> google doesn't give me that data
[15:31:14] <danheberden> they only do page hits
[15:31:15] <gnarf> pageviews tracked by analytics then
[15:31:21] <danheberden> ya
[15:31:32] <danheberden> 219355.2 unique visitors
[15:31:41] <gnarf> 1mil / day isn't too terrible, but I assume there are some of those that will never hit that metric
[15:31:44] <gnarf> RSS feeds etc
[15:32:03] <danheberden> also most http goes against the cdn
[15:32:08] <danheberden> so not sure there'd be many more http requests
[15:32:40] <nacin> well, that's 647 pages a minute. let's assume every request is 40 HTTP requests, all uncached. that's 26k hits a minute. a well-tuned nginx will do about 7-8k a second, if not more.
[15:33:25] <danheberden> can't help but think of my old 286 when you talk like that
[15:34:30] <gnarf> nacin: well, I'm willing to give it a shot, but I'm still going to want to have at least one proxy cache frontend ready for the site-launch - it just seems like the safest thing we could do
[15:34:50] <gnarf> i really just don't want to see a processing bottleneck on jq01
[15:35:05] <gnarf> because of handling 20k reqs/min
[15:35:19] <danheberden> i like the separation of concerns from a managing perspective as well
[15:35:19] <gnarf> from php-fpm, nginx, mysql, any of it
[15:35:39] <nacin> don't get me wrong, load balancing is a great idea. I would just focus primarily on getting the main server singing as much as possible first. that frontend is going to pass everything to jq01, and if it isn't well-tuned, your problem will be there.
[15:36:01] <gnarf> agree, tuning jq01 is going to be key in either solution
[15:36:16] <gnarf> so microcache, apc, etc are all nessecary
[15:37:07] <gnarf> i'd like jq01 to be able to handle the heavy load itself
[15:37:29] <nacin> also just keep in mind that setting up a frontend proxy means you get to deal with the fun that is making sure that all of the fastcgi variables are passed to the script
[15:39:41] <gnarf> nacin: seems like that would be handled anyway by nature of the http proxying
[15:39:48] <gnarf> X-Forwarded-For and all
[15:40:09] <nacin> it making it to the script doesn't mean WordPress knows to look for those headers, since they can be anything
[15:40:13] <nacin> it's fine, I have code for that too
[15:40:56] <gnarf> but like the actual request as far as wordpress sees would look exactly like the request from a direct client
[15:41:02] <gnarf> save for forwarded ip
[15:41:12] <gnarf> wouldn't it?
[15:42:33] <nacin> forwarded IP, forwarded protocol, forwarded port
[15:42:41] <nacin> usually the big 3
[15:44:40] <nacin> I'm talking with our community scaling expert and if you have only one application box, using nginx as a frontend cache proxy indeed doesn't make any sense.
[15:44:52] <nacin> varnish might make sense.
[15:47:04] <gnarf> well then - lets tune the fuck out of jq01 and hope it doesnt burn up in a week? :)
[15:48:07] <nacin> sounds like a plan. :-)
[15:48:36] <nacin> Essentially, to gain any benefit from a frontend caching proxy, you need multiple application servers. Think of it like memcache. No need to use memcache if you only have one server.
[15:48:45] <gnarf> will microcache be enough?
[15:49:02] <nacin> we'll find out. :) (yes)
[15:50:03] <nacin> gnarf: ideally, you want only one frontend caching proxy. if you had two, the other one would only be due to failover. but this is still only if you have multiple application servers.
[15:50:20] <gnarf> makes sense
[15:50:39] <nacin> there will be some systems people from Automattic at the jQuery conference next week
[15:50:59] <nacin> I can ask one of them to sit down with you guys and help tune some things beyond what I could do
[15:51:01] <gnarf> although some of the domains will have sub-directories that need to proxy to another server
[15:51:34] <nacin> you can do that on the main server.
[15:51:40] <gnarf> and I was hoping to avoid having to put those in the main conf, was just gonna have the proxy choose
[15:51:49] <gnarf> because the main jq01 conf is just like a "catch-all" host
[15:51:59] <nacin> is this a temporary thing, or more of a permanent thing?
[15:52:06] <gnarf> the subdirectories?
[15:52:19] <gnarf> like jqueryui.com/themeroller will prolly always proxy to some node service
[15:53:12] <nacin> that seems fine to me. though it also might make sense to convert those to subdomains and then leverage DNS.
[15:53:50] <gnarf> nacin: thats our eventual plan
[15:54:28] <gnarf> nacin: i also figured having a 301 would be easier in a frontend stop rather than in the "global" site - but since we are puppeting configs anyway
[15:54:38] <gnarf> i could actually make it write a config for each one
[15:54:50] <gnarf> rather than one giant config for all the sites
[15:55:35] <gnarf> nacin: we should know hopefully before next wednesday if this box can handle what we want from it
[15:56:02] <gnarf> we can put some of the "realistic loads" onto it
[15:56:36] <gnarf> and then use http perf testing tools to slam it with an extra million rss/index page views or something
[15:57:40] <gnarf> I guess because I know what proxy_cache is, and does, and have used it before, it's got that trust - but if microcache + apc + php-fpm + nginx supersedes my crufty old ways, I'm all ears
[15:59:09] <nacin> You've used proxy_cache before when proxying to apache. *there* it is beneficial.
[15:59:22] <gnarf> :)
[16:22:33] <gnarf> so nacin - the wordpress nginx conf on the server should have all the info needed for caching right?
[16:23:26] <gnarf> nacin: we need to get your name onto our team page with all the help you've been giving us :)
[16:24:03] <nacin> ha
[16:24:14] <nacin> gnarf: not sure if the caching part is on the server. I can do that, though.
[16:25:17] <gnarf> nacin: one less thing for me to worry about, so you won't hear me stop you ;)
[16:26:24] <nacin> hm, http://irc.jquery.com/%23jqueryui-dev/ isn't searchable?
[16:28:30] <nacin> anyway, I re-found that gist. going to work on applying it tonight.
[16:49:30] <gnarf> nacin: was it the one you sent me in pm just now?
[16:49:45] <gnarf> nacin: im gonna drop it on the wordpress box issues for a reference :P)
[16:49:57] <nacin> yep, that's fine
[18:18:38] <jzaefferer> hey guts, just about didn't make it to the meeting
[18:18:49] <jzaefferer> even though I flew through nine timezones!!1
[18:18:52] <jzaefferer> *guys
[18:19:01] <jzaefferer> also I'm tired so probably can't type anymore
[18:19:13] <jzaefferer> though "hey guts" is pretty funny
[18:20:08] <jzaefferer> ping gnarf kborchers rworth
[18:20:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer: pong
[18:20:36] <rworth> jzaefferer hey
[18:20:38] <kborchers> you in SF?
[18:20:45] <jzaefferer> yep
[18:20:50] <kborchers> nice
[18:21:01] <jzaefferer> just about arrived at my airbnb-apartment/room, will stay here for a week
[18:21:15] <jzaefferer> in the kitchen now - in my actual room the window is open, and it smells like pot
[18:21:17] <rworth> glad you made it
[18:21:20] <jzaefferer> from outside, somewhere...
[18:21:52] <jzaefferer> not surprising in SF, I guess
[18:22:15] <kborchers> not surprising in <enter city name here>, I guess
[18:22:21] <kborchers> :)
[18:40:15] <jzaefferer> so rworth, with https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/34 being fixed, qunitjs.com should now be able to make use of iframes?
[18:40:15] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[18:40:49] <jzaefferer> I'd still need to figure out how to duplicate that nginx rewrite for my local Apache...
[18:41:47] <jzaefferer> like an Apache RewriteRule
[18:41:50] <jzaefferer> should be a one-liner...
[19:36:48] <kborchers> can anyone tell me how to fix - Error: Mismatching versions. grunt-wordpress: 1.0.0; XML-RPC version: 0.1.1
[19:36:57] <kborchers> jzaefferer: rworth gnarf ^
[20:05:51] <nacin> jzaefferer: I have a rule here, let me get it for you
[20:06:18] <nacin> jzaefferer: RewriteRule ^resources/(.*) gw-resources/%{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [L]
