[06:28:02] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15magourex opened issue #7963: "pageshow" trigger before panel "complete" when changing page from panel 02http://git.io/NuPn
[08:08:51] <Omar-> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7937
[08:09:18] <Omar-> .listview("option", "icon", "bars") sets icon but doesn't refresh UI
[08:09:32] <Omar-> .listview("refresh") doesn't do anything
[08:10:02] <Omar-> calling .buttonMarkup({icon:"bars"}) which is deprecated solves the problem
[08:10:21] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/ayu92bkk/
[08:10:25] <Omar-> arschmitz ping
[08:14:03] <arschmitz> Omar-: you cant set options on listview after init
[08:15:27] <Omar-> arschmitz wouldn't a good idea to make it possible?
[08:16:59] <Omar-> It's possible to it before pagecreate or manually by removing/adding classes http://stackoverflow.com/a/21351751/
[08:17:15] <arschmitz> Omar-: there is an open issue for it already
[08:17:34] <arschmitz> not all widgets allow this currently
[08:17:39] <arschmitz> prior to 1.4 none did
[08:20:42] <Omar-> are you planning to introduce it in 1.5?
[08:23:28] <arschmitz> we had but not sure any more we are pretty booked for 1.5
[08:25:50] <Omar-> arschmitz best of luck :)
