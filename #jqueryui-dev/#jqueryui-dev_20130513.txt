[10:13:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/145
[10:13:29] <rxaviers> on a scoped css, isnt user expected to scope a parent element instead of the widget itself?
[10:14:00] <rxaviers> In the above, if user uses <body class="rudy">...</body>, it will work just fine.
[10:15:18] <rxaviers> But, he's using $("#dialog").dialog({dialogClass: 'rudy'}); which doesnt work
[10:15:37] <rxaviers> is it supposed to work?
[11:07:09] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Question about the CSS docs when you have a moment:
[11:07:09] <tj_vantoll> "We can add a custom field to indicate that it should be included in the sidebar." Does this mean the page itself would be a top level entity on the sidebar (not the Theming category)?
[11:08:21] <tj_vantoll> The easings page has a category but it doesn't seem to actually have any effect (no pun intended). https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/pages/easings.html#L13
[11:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Oh, right. I was thinking of the jqueryui.com sidebar when I wrote that comment.
[11:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> Right now, if you make it a page, does the new category show up in the sidebar?
[11:13:39] <tj_vantoll> No, it requires an entry.
[11:14:20] <tj_vantoll> The effects page does not show up in the Utilities category: http://api.jqueryui.com/category/utilities/.
[11:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can make API sites include pages for category listings.
[11:16:44] <tj_vantoll> That would be ideal for this.
[11:17:31] <tj_vantoll> I think it makes sense too. If you give a page a category it might as well show up in the listing.
[11:18:17] <tj_vantoll> Pages don't have descriptions though.
[11:23:36] <jhilden> Hey rxaviers
[11:23:58] <rxaviers> jhilden, hello! I want to understand better what's your goal with your sass gem
[11:24:17] <jhilden> sure.  what do you need to know?
[11:24:36] <rxaviers> from what I understood, you want users to tweak their themes using sass variables, is that correct?
[11:24:47] <jhilden> yes
[11:25:19] <jhilden> and the limitation with the background images you mentioned is definitely an issue
[11:25:26] <rxaviers> ok, do need any other information from jquery ui to do so?
[11:25:35] <rxaviers> yeah.
[11:26:03] <jhilden> the only thing you need is to understand what the individual variables are for
[11:26:54] <rxaviers> Can you generate those vars using sass somehow?
[11:27:26] <jhilden> not sure what you mean
[11:27:40] <rxaviers> You can take a look at the logic to generate those vars on themeroller.js
[11:28:20] <jhilden> ok
[11:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> jhilden: You probably need a mixin with parameters to generate the file names.
[11:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> But you'll also need to generate the images themselves.
[11:29:04] <jhilden> I don't think I want to go there
[11:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming you want the full control that TR provides.
[11:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> So then you shouldn't care about most of these complex values.
[11:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> You're going to end up with solid color backgrounds, right?
[11:29:55] <jhilden> yes, i think so
[11:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Either that, or you're going to ask your users to provide the filename and generate the images themselves.
[11:33:04] <jhilden> the limitation only affects users that want to both keep using image backgrounds AND change background color variables at the same time.  so I'm not too worried
[11:33:48] <jhilden> I will probably just update the documentation for the gem to make sure people are aware of that
[11:33:55] <rxaviers> or change icon colors
[11:34:16] <jhilden> true
[11:36:03] <rxaviers> if you want to skip that, I presume you are good to go with what you have so far.
[11:36:09] <rxaviers> but, just let me know otherwise
[11:37:29] <jhilden> it would still be nice to have the processed theme variables in a readable format (so it will be easy to keep the gem up to date, when jQuery UI updates).  but unfortunately I have to leave right now
[11:38:16] <jhilden> if you are willing to do that and provide some directions in the github issue that would be awesome
[11:38:49] <jhilden> I also might meet up with Joern in Cologne tomorrow to chat about this
[11:38:53] <jhilden> we will see
[11:39:12] <jhilden> in any case thanks for all the information so far and pointing out the image background issue
[11:39:16] <jhilden> talk to you later
[11:39:23] <rxaviers> ywc
[11:39:41] <rxaviers> probably that decision will be up to jorn and scott

[11:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> I wish people would stop relying on TR so much.
[11:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> Just build nicer themes.
[11:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's not that hard.
[11:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> TR is, by design, only capable of producing one "style" of theme.
[11:57:53] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you think we could do something in order to have people to do that? Eg. make some cool different themes as a hello world example, so people get motivated and build their own. Perhaps allowing them to be listed somehow in our page.
[11:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> We need a CSS Zen Garden for jQuery UI :-)
[11:59:34] <rxaviers> yeap! that would definitely be really cool.
[11:59:46] <rxaviers> :)
[12:02:34] <tj_vantoll> Wouldn't be to hard to do something like that in theory. Have a jsBin with all the widgets created and some skeleton CSS.
[12:06:46] <rxaviers> how do we get the initial good designs? is it something our design experts could get into?
[12:08:04] <rxaviers> like nate or necker
[12:16:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, can we do #981 and 982 on 1-9-stable branch too?
[12:17:21] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/981
[12:17:25] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/982
[12:18:02] <rxaviers> Im afraid not, right. Because, it changes files structure.
[12:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's unlikely to make it to 1-9-stable.
[12:18:54] <rxaviers> = if's :'( snif
[12:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> master is 1.11.0 anyway.
[12:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> So did you really want to ask about 1-10-stable?
[12:19:34] <rxaviers> ah! my bad then
[12:19:52] <rxaviers> so, we'll stick with 1.10 and 1.11 on db?
[12:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> 981 seems iffy for a point release.
[12:22:32] <rxaviers> scott, let me ask you a more base question (double checking question)
[12:23:26] <rxaviers> after the cutoff change, do you wanna get rid of the `build` task from UI, or just make DB an official dependency of UI and make `build` use db?
[12:23:57] <rxaviers> because, jquery has a `build` task (actually, even a custom build task). We'd be different from them.
[12:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> neitehr
[12:24:44] * rxaviers is curious
[12:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-ui will always have a build task, and it will never use download builder.
[12:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> The release script will use download builder.
[12:25:07] <rxaviers> how will ui build task be like after the cutoff?
[12:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> Same as it is today.
[12:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there will be some minor changes.
[12:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Since we'll be moving things like the banner out of grunt.
[12:44:20] <rxaviers> ok thks
[14:40:43] <Krinkle> that seems almost impossible, since anonymous hits (the majority) is served from static html cache
[14:40:47] <Krinkle> wrong channel
[18:16:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin just wondering if either of you got a chance to look at those pointer changes â€¦ doesn't have to be tonight but would appreciate any feedback you might have before that meeting tomorrow
[18:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'll check it in the morning.
[18:17:55] <kborchers> thanks
[18:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> Going through MediaWiki right now.
[18:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's oh so fun.
[18:18:09] <kborchers> yeah, sounds like a blast
[18:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> "I wants more simplification format of Jquery . And well documented ."
[18:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks Susanta. What a lovely contribution to our wiki!
[18:28:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: it does seem like Jquery would simplify the spelling for a LOT of people :P
