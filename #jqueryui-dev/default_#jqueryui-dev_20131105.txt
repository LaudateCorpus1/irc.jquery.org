[02:29:36] <rxaviers> Doqnach, sure, how can I help?
[03:11:54] <Doqnach> I have an issue trying to load an 1.9.x theme and downloading it's 1.10.x equivalent
[03:12:30] <Doqnach> When I use the URL from the old CSS it does load the correct options on the left, but the example on the right stays like smoothness, and if I download the theme I also get smoothness instead of the custom
[03:13:13] <Doqnach> I've tried Opera (12)/Firefox (23)/Chrome (30)/IE10
[03:13:17] <Doqnach> all give the same result
[03:13:35] <Doqnach> even when rebuilding the theme from scratch I still get smoothness when I hit 'download'
[03:14:25] <Doqnach> rxaviers: is this a known issue, or am I doing something wrong? :-P
[03:25:12] <rxaviers> Doqnach, can you paste me the link you're trying
[03:25:30] <rxaviers> s/$/?
[04:01:03] <Doqnach> rxaviers: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!zThemeParams=5d00000100d705000000000000003d8888d844329a8dfe02723de3e5700bbb34ecf36ce5959f380e613cafa997b39424a52ffca05194f1d1c3e077aa4ac96e92487a70544631007f40870d1cc797e14f5bc62d0e72900510e0155843ac923dc9f9305c225965472a89f866f5eecc7542e348dc7bf4d4b336f1daf62bfe31fa21ca433b96d23e9e1b7520945d27339d728d6fc241562a36a17441bfb6a64fd30e32b473f6840f81d14a9ccf0daaadbfa8bbd6f43edf01fde1f3f01586cbf413d5c522988b63e6c42
[04:03:36] <Doqnach> rxaviers: original 1.9.x: http://pastebin.com/1KGjkyBA
[04:03:46] <rxaviers> thks will check
[04:03:59] <Doqnach> thanks
[04:05:48] <Doqnach> example difference is 'clickable: active state' should be #fffff flat 0%
[04:06:42] <Doqnach> rxaviers: uhm... I think I found the bug actually just now O_o
[04:07:00] <Doqnach> when the % input fields are left empty, it does not rerender
[04:07:42] <Doqnach> rxaviers: if I put a 0 (zero) instead in all the empty % fields it does rerender the example
[04:09:20] <Doqnach> using the URL for the old custom theme leaves those fields empty by default though
[04:10:41] <Doqnach> download still fails though
[04:22:28] <rxaviers> Doqnach, does it look your theme http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!zThemeParams=5d00000100d905000000000000003d8888d844329a8dfe02723de3e5700bbb34ecf36ce5959f380e613cafa997b39424a52ffca05194f1d1c3e077aa4ac96e92487a70544631007f40870d1cc797e14f5bc62d0e72900510e0155843ac923dc9f9305c225965472a89f866f5eecc7542e348dc7bf4d4b336f1daf62bfe31fa21ca433b96d23e9e1b7520945d27339d728d6fc241562a36a17441bfb6a64fd30e32b473f6840f81d14a9ccf0daaadbfa8bbd6f43edf01fde1f3f

[04:22:42] <rxaviers> smaller link
[04:23:08] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7318276
[04:26:45] <Doqnach> yes that is the exact same URL I got
[04:27:02] <Doqnach> but when I download, the package only contains the 'smoothness' theme, not the custom one
[04:29:53] <Doqnach> hmmm there seems to be a few differences between the two links
[04:34:16] <Doqnach> nope, still get a package with only smoothness in it, both from Opera as well as Chrome
[04:34:25] <Doqnach> (from your link)
[05:00:19] <rxaviers> Doqnach, I saw the bug. I will let you know when it's fixed.
[05:00:46] <rxaviers> (hope this is fixed in 30mins)

[05:18:01] <rxaviers> whoops, let me paste it on gist
[05:18:10] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7318865
[05:24:21] <rxaviers> FWIW, you were experiencing this bug, because of the url you were using. Our implementation was supposed to fix buggy links, but it seems your case isn't addressed https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/168#issuecomment-26087875
[05:24:22] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #168 by amnuts (4w 13h ago): Theme roller form elements not updated
[05:28:05] <Doqnach> rxaviers: the link (theme) wasn't entirely correct but I am able to adjust the values again and download the custom theme now so seems to be solved
[05:28:19] <Doqnach> just out of interest: what was the bug?
[05:33:03] <rxaviers> Doqnach, short answer, invalid parameter wrongly added by TR. We zip params to make URL a little shorter. All theme params become a single zThemeParams parameter in the URL. In this case, the zip created the zThemeParams. But, for some reason it included an non-existent zThemeParams into it. So, server finds an invalid zThemeParams after unzipping it.
[05:33:48] <rxaviers> The initial issue was the one you found: missing opacity. Second issue was the above.
[05:34:57] <Doqnach> happy it got fixed :-] I ran into it yesterday and had not found any resources on it yet except from something from 8 months ago which was a browser related bug
[05:35:18] <Doqnach> good work on the speedy fix
[05:37:51] <rxaviers> Np, if you find any other bug on DB, just let me know.
[05:38:18] <rxaviers> (DB = download builder / theme roller)
[05:39:58] <Doqnach> will do, though I do not use it often since the systems I'm working on currently are all based on the same colorscheme ;-]
[05:40:24] <Doqnach> should this be reported in any bug report system for archiving?
[05:40:50] <rxaviers> this one in particular I will add to an existing bug. Thanks
[05:41:15] <Doqnach> sure thing

[07:05:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[07:05:36] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14e2d9e5b 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Added mailmap.
[07:06:10] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: hey
[07:07:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: How is it going over there?
[07:07:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Talking about .animate() vs. CSS transitions ...
[07:25:56] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I was wondering if we could move the way we generate the CSS for a download builder custom build into the repository's Gruntfile.js. That way, we can generate custom CSS every time you call grunt --modules=a,b,c ... we would also unify the way download builder creates a custom build with the way calling grunt --module from the command line creates a custom build.
[07:34:42] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: We could extract the logic into a grunt task
[07:35:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it basically creates a dependency tree from the JS modules
[07:35:38] <gseguin> then walks through it to create an array of CSS files that should be included
[07:36:21] <gseguin> Yeah having something that works for both project is definitely a goal
[07:37:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: TBH, I'd love to see the build become a backend for the download builder. That way, the download builder takes care of presenting the module tree to the user, whereas the build takes care of, well, creating the custom build, and oh! BTW: The same code takes care of doing the release.
[07:38:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That way, we'd (theoretically) never again have problems that only happen in a custom build, but don't happen in a release, because of source order differences.
[07:38:41] <gseguin> true
[07:44:32] <rxaviers> _|Nix|_, I had this exact same discussion (or at least very similar) with Scott back in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/951
[07:44:33] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #951 by rxaviers (7mon 1d ago): Release: Cutoff duplicate parts with download builder
[07:45:24] <rxaviers> To avoid duplicate code, the point was to keep the build logic in one single place.
[07:57:04] <_|Nix|_> rxaviers: Thanks! I'll read the discussion ...
