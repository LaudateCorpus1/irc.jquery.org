[04:48:53] <jzaefferer> gnarf: how would we integrate TestSWarm with Travis?
[05:04:19] <jzaefferer> gnarf: as for setting up jenkins - install jenkins with apt-get or yum, then get a copy of the jobs from the swarm install in /var/lib/jenkins
[05:04:44] <jzaefferer> gnarf: probably the jobs and users folders is what you'd need

[08:31:33] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #360: STILL FAILING in 38 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/360/
[08:31:33] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: First draft for a new notification API, via using callback, telling you were the of-element is, not just when something flipped. New test page demonstrates usage
[08:31:34] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Use a separate object and argument for the feedback information, keeping position props as they were
[08:31:34] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Fix single var, whitespace. Clone targetOffset to avoid reading that twice
[08:31:35] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Mini refactoring, avoids proxying using callback multiple times if more then one element is positioned
[08:31:35] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Extend feedback test page to include two mouse-positioned elements, highlights the 0px center/middle limitation
[08:31:36] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Improve feedback API by giving the center/middle position more weight. Also removed themeswitcher from test pages, now load faster
[08:31:36] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Restrict the center/middle priority to target < element cases
[08:31:37] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Refactor offset calculations
[08:31:37] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Calculate scrollInfo just once, not for each element
[08:31:38] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Cleanup feedback test page
[08:31:38] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Refactor css parse calls
[08:31:39] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Cache Math.abs and Math.max lookups
[08:31:39] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: add target property to feedback argument, to allow additional calculation in user's using callback
[08:31:40] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Inline center variable. Not necessary with gzip (or a good minifier) in place, wasn't consistent with other inline strings
[08:31:40] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Refactor within-data to avoid calculating that more then needed. Not quite done, but good enough for now
[08:31:41] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Finish refactoring of within data
[08:31:41] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Extract getWithinInfo method, use that for tests that call getScrollInfo directly, pass within info to that, gets rid of a few more DOM accesses
[08:31:42] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Cache the scrollbarWidth calculation result
[08:31:42] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Position: Expose target and element dimensions to allow further customization, like calculating the angle between the two elements
