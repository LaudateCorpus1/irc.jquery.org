[05:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell clarkbox I talked to Ritesh about setting up a call to debug the BrowserStack issues.
[05:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, stupid missing bot.
[05:40:41] <jzaefferer> gnarf or clarkbox around?
[05:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's annoying that I have grunt installed globally, the global grunt is what runs, but npm installs grunt locally for `npm install` in jquery-ui.
[05:46:24] <jzaefferer> global grunt makes only sense to run the init task
[05:46:33] <jzaefferer> but once you've got a package.json, it shouldn't be global
[05:47:25] <jzaefferer> but even without a package.json, you could just `npm install grunt`, then `grunt init`
[05:47:40] <jzaefferer> it really doesn't have to be global at all
[05:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> How does the local grunt run?
[05:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> How would `grunt init` know what grunt is?
[05:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> How would you invoke the non-global grunt?
[05:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> `./node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt` seems annoying
[05:57:30] <tbranyen> alias localgrunt='./node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt'
[05:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> SHUT UP WITH YOUR SMARTS
[05:58:13] <tbranyen> ^_^
[05:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually gonna just alias grunt to that and remove the global grunt.
[05:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[05:58:45] <tbranyen> hrm, you might as well just npm link at that point
[05:58:54] <tbranyen> which creates a global symbolic link to your local install
[05:59:28] <tbranyen> inside ./node_modules/grunt run `sudo npm link`
[05:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't want it tied to a specific version.
[06:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> I want to use whatever version the project says to use.
[06:00:22] <tbranyen> yea, when you update locally since its a symlink it'll auto update your global
[06:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since Ben tells people to include grunt in their devDependencies.
[06:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> No, I'm saying I want different projects to be allowed to list differnet versions.
[06:00:59] <tbranyen> if you're already aliasing grunt, you won't be able to use different versions anyways at that point, although an alias would be more flexible than a symlink
[06:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> And use the correct version for each project.
[06:01:11] <tbranyen> hrm
[06:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> If the alias is relative, ./node_modules/..., then it should work, right?
[06:01:43] <tbranyen> ohhhh
[06:01:45] <tbranyen> f yeah
[06:01:47] <tbranyen> good call
[06:01:55] <tbranyen> SHUT UP WITH YOUR SMARTS
[06:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> If grunt becomes really popular, then hopefully it'll stabilize and just be global with everyone using the one version that has been stable for X years.
[06:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> Like Make.
[06:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> But for now, I think the alias is the best solution.
[06:04:43] <tbranyen> yeah i don't forsee him making too many more api changes *crosses fingers*
[06:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> Could probably even have the alias smart enough to fallback to global grunt if there is no local grunt.
[06:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know enough bash to write that though.
[06:20:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you don't need the alias, `grunt` should just resolve to `node_modules/.bin/grunt`
[06:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't
[06:20:59] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:21:10] <jzaefferer> then just add this to your .bash_profile:
[06:21:11] <jzaefferer> export PATH=node_modules/.bin:$PATH
[06:21:14] <jzaefferer> TEH MAGIC!
[06:22:37] <jzaefferer> That way you can run all kind of npm-installed binaries locally
[06:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> SHUT UP WITH YOUR SMARTS
[06:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> That solves the local with fallback to global issue too.
[06:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> As long as the node_modules comes first in the path.
[06:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't know about node_modules/.bin
[06:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's useful.
[06:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> huh, we don't have a tabs demo for animations.
[06:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> heh, and the docs for the fx option refer to the "normal" speed http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs#option-fx

[11:36:21] <gnarf> nice got all the way to swarm tho
[11:36:22] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/6/
[11:37:11] <clarkbox> ...and kicked off some browserstack workers
[11:42:56] <jzaefferer> and gnarf saves the day :-)

[14:40:17] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Brendan Byrd (45m, 4s ago): Slide function now works without DIV wrapping, utilizing clip Split out clip step routines to use cssHook, including TBLR "virtual" CSS properties Add CSS3 units to cssUnitConvert function Add directionNormalize function to help out with direction naming Fixed 404s for tests/index.html
[14:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^^
[14:42:24] <gnarf> hrm
[14:42:26] <gnarf> that seems huge
[14:42:34] <gnarf> is it cool?
[14:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> It does seem huge. I think he added a ton of stuff.
[14:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> The animation looks good though.
[14:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> And no wrapper.
[14:43:35] <gnarf> nice
[14:44:00] <gnarf> i wish that was like 4 different commits
[14:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> We need to dig through this.
[14:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, there's stuff that seems mostly unrelated, like unit conversion: https://github.com/SineSwiper/jquery-ui/commit/238e01f9e68c6baea606c2cd09eac785c5c257e8#L1R914

[14:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which is a big chunk of code
[14:44:57] <gnarf> right
[14:45:50] <gnarf> i'll add it to my ever growing list of things I need to look at
[14:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> Also some of the clip step might be useful for things like margin and padding.
[14:46:01] <gnarf> first look though, i like where its going
[14:46:08] <scott_gonzalez> Though I guess we're just splitting those into 4 separate steps, right?
[14:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> Which we can't do for clip. At least I don't think we can.
[14:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> Might also give find something that could move into core.
[14:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be awesome if you could dig through this and give some feedback.
[14:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> He says "Passes all tests.  I'm sure you'll probably want to refactor and move some of the subs around, but hopefully, you'll get the gist of how it works."
[14:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> We can also clean up stuff like: fx.pos * (fx.end[i] - fx.start[i])) + fx.start[i]
[14:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> That can just be fx.pos.
[14:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually he has clipTop, clipRight, etc.
[14:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> Could potentially strip out a lot of code by splitting clip into 4 props.
[14:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> Heading out.
[14:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I assume you'll leave some feedback when you get a chance?
[14:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a lot to dig through.
[14:58:52] <gnarf> yeah
