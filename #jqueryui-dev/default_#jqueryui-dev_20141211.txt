[12:02:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You said you had some questions about the ui-1-12 test fixes?
[12:02:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: on chrome its only 3% slower
[12:02:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It may well also be the case on FF. I only ran on iteration.
[12:03:05] <arschmitz> 9% on safari
[12:03:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[12:03:25] <arschmitz> so this does not seem like a concern over all
[12:03:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, if we short-circuit the title bar, we may even get an improvement.
[12:03:35] <arschmitz> yup
[12:03:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, there are still a few things missing, like making sure the modal always covers the document.
[12:04:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and setting up the repositioning upon orientation change.
[12:04:13] <gabriel_schulhof> So, that may still add some overhead.
[12:04:20] <arschmitz> so i mean lets not ignore it during transition but seems like we dont need to worry about it
[12:04:31] <gabriel_schulhof> But I thinnk we should start from scratch with the repositioning when we switch to dialog.
[12:04:49] <arschmitz> i agree
[12:04:56] <gabriel_schulhof> It's amazing how much energy goes into making it draggable/resizable.
[12:04:58] <arschmitz> i think we should avoid it whenever possible 
[12:05:10] <arschmitz> repositioning that is
[12:05:56] <gabriel_schulhof> I think we need to offer something intelligent, but it also needs to be well-tested and smooth/snappy.
[12:06:17] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15rxaviers closed issue #105: UTC time formatting for the correct timezone 02http://git.io/zCessw
[12:06:20] <arschmitz> yeah but i agree we should start from scratch
[12:06:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Though dealing with resize/orientationchange is a nightmare, because browsers emit those things spuriously waaay too often.
[12:06:27] <arschmitz> not even look at current popup code 
[12:06:48] <arschmitz> we need to debounce it and check if its actually needed after
[12:06:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh! And /definitely/ make reposition an extension!
[12:07:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's hard to debounce, because there could be as much as second between resizes where the viewport size is the same from one resize to the next!
[12:07:30] <gabriel_schulhof> *a* second, I mean
[12:08:03] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and it's a wait-and-see debounce, not a coagulate-n-events-into-one debounce.
[12:08:33] <gabriel_schulhof> It's like "no resizes in the last <n>? OK ... looks like the storm passed. Lessee what we need to do ... "
[12:08:44] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:08:53] <gabriel_schulhof> *has* passed. *sigh* ... can't type.
[12:09:55] <gabriel_schulhof> It's really bad and device-specific.
[12:10:11] <gabriel_schulhof> But hey, the device landscape will have also changed. Maybe we can benefit from that.
[12:10:18] <arschmitz> ok so in the test fixes your maintaing $.Widget as part of $.mobile.widget
[12:10:25] <arschmitz> which i dont think is what we want
[12:10:30] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15rxaviers closed issue #30: UTC support 02http://git.io/D8sYHw
[12:10:47] <arschmitz> $.mobile.widget should be just the things we add onto the widget
[12:10:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, yeah, since $.mobile.widget is deprecated and will be removed in 1.5.0.
[12:10:52] <arschmitz> basicly a collection of extensions
[12:11:10] <arschmitz> so it should be $.mobile.widget = {};
[12:11:15] <arschmitz> and then we can just add onto it
[12:11:39] <arschmitz> its deprecated so its not public so we can do what ever we want with it
[12:11:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait, I thought that's what I was doing.
[12:12:04] <arschmitz> no you add $.Widget to it
[12:12:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see ... we've retired it from public life, but we're keeping it.
[12:12:49] <arschmitz> so like $.mobile.widget sould only have the backcompat and theme props
[12:12:57] <arschmitz> never $.Widget
[12:13:02] <arschmitz> and all its goodness
[12:13:27] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, but we need to extend $.Widget with backcompat and theme.
[12:13:46] <arschmitz> that will be done by each widget to it self
[12:13:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[12:14:01] <arschmitz> because it may not need both 
[12:14:16] <arschmitz> and we dont need our own super factory copy
[12:14:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, js/widget.js can disappear entirely then, because we'll have proper autoinit.
[12:14:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait no. autoinit does not handle _getCreateOptions() right?
[12:14:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Or does it? I forget.
[12:15:39] <arschmitz> yes it does
[12:15:46] <arschmitz> and yes it can
[12:16:05] <arschmitz> auto init is useless if you cant set options some how
[12:16:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Goes to show you how confused I am :)
[12:16:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, I think things will become much clearer if we merge autoinit.
[12:16:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Can we merge that into ui-1-12?
[12:17:06] <gabriel_schulhof> After all, that has nothing to do with classes, so it should still work.
[12:17:25] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and then we can clean up $.Widget/$.mobile.widget properly.
[12:17:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, I've been adding extensions needed by mutliple widgets to $.mobile.behaviors.
[12:17:48] <arschmitz> im going to do a pr on master
[12:17:54] <arschmitz> and then rebase master
[12:18:07] <gabriel_schulhof> You mean rebase ui-1-12 onto the modified master?
[12:18:14] <arschmitz> no
[12:18:21] <arschmitz> ill do a pr on master once it lands
[12:18:28] <arschmitz> ill rebase ui-1-12 on master
[12:18:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. That's what I thought.
[12:19:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I think that's the time when we should clean up $.mobile.widget.
[12:19:39] <arschmitz> ok
[12:20:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Also, looking at widget.theme.js and widget.backcompat.js it looks like your using $.mobile.widget exactly the same way as $.mobile.behaviors.
[12:21:12] <arschmitz> yeah i think we should remove behivors
[12:21:22] <arschmitz> and anything in it add to $.mobile.widget
[12:21:39] <arschmitz> because we should probably remove add first last class i think we decide
[12:21:42] <arschmitz> d
[12:22:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but we still have widgets/forms/reset.js
[12:22:21] <gabriel_schulhof> ... used by slider and selectmenu at least.
[12:22:42] <arschmitz> yeah that will go away and really could now
[12:23:00] <arschmitz> its honestly pretty trivial to put in the individual widgets we debated it for ui
[12:23:09] <arschmitz> but decided it was not worth it
[12:23:21] <arschmitz> however we are seperating the label finding
[12:23:24] <arschmitz> as totally worth it
[12:24:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Really? Which two widgets need it?
[12:24:18] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean checkboxradio, and ... ?
[12:24:19] <arschmitz> selectmenu and checkboxradio
[12:24:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, really, selectmenu too?
[12:24:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[12:24:34] <arschmitz> yeah you need to bind to the click
[12:24:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. Label finding is non-trivial.
[12:24:37] <arschmitz> to activate it
[12:24:59] <arschmitz> and for focus
[12:24:59] <gabriel_schulhof> It's too bad we have to duplicate native browser code.
[12:25:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Which UI branch has the label finding code?
[12:26:54] <arschmitz> its not seperate yet its still in checkboxradio
[12:27:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. So, button?
[12:27:27] <arschmitz> yes

[12:46:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Might want to add a function to core.
[12:46:20] <arschmitz> yeah thats what i just said :)
[12:46:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, there it is :)
[12:46:46] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, heck, it's needed in core itself :)
[12:47:14] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm not even sure why this isn't in jQuery core ...
[12:47:31] <gabriel_schulhof> I can't imagine us being the only project where we need to construct selectors out of data present in the DOM.
[12:47:44] <arschmitz> oh you mean jQuery core
[12:47:49] <arschmitz> i meant ui core
[12:47:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm OK with UI core for now.
[12:48:16] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm just thinking why not **the** core.
[12:48:41] <arschmitz> im pretty sure we have discussed this
[12:49:10] <gabriel_schulhof> This is where searchable IRC logs would come in handy.
[12:49:29] <arschmitz> was not irc it was in person
