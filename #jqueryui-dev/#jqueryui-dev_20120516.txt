[10:05:35] <gelegrodan> atleast he tried
[10:05:37] <gelegrodan> !
[12:45:32] <rworth> gelegrodan ping
[12:48:00] <rworth> scott_gonzalez and I updated the http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Docs2xml page
[12:48:02] <rworth> As a first step, we'd like you to clone the jquery-docs repo and go through and document each option and event and method that the widget factory gives to each widget
[12:48:22] <rworth> so this would mean modifying accordion to have enable, disable, option, create, etc.
[12:48:28] <rworth> and dialog, and tabs, etc.
[12:49:00] <rworth> I'm gonna be out of town for the next couple days but hit up scott_gonzalez or jzaefferer if you get stuck or have any questions. And thanks for offering to help! :)
[12:52:52] <gelegrodan> rworth: pong
[13:11:46] <rworth> gelegrodan any questios about what I said above?
[13:13:04] <gelegrodan> hm yeah kinda, first off; the jqueryui.com docs seems to have it for accoridion for example?
[13:13:07] <gelegrodan> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[13:13:17] <gelegrodan> methods
[13:13:48] <rworth> right, so you're more than welcome to copy and paste this as a starting point
[13:14:04] <rworth> this is generating by the existing system (mediawiki templates)
[13:14:11] <rworth> but it's part of the generation system
[13:14:20] <rworth> meaning it's not actually in the source docs for each component
[13:14:29] <gelegrodan> ok
[13:14:36] <rworth> which is why when we ran the mediawiki to xml conversion, it didn't come through
[13:14:54] <gelegrodan> i see
[13:15:43] <gelegrodan> well, the options is kinda eady, check the source or do a $( "#accordion" ).accordion("option"); and it return a object
[13:15:47] <gelegrodan> with the methods
[13:16:54] <gelegrodan> but the methods for example
[13:17:01] <gelegrodan> or events
[13:17:21] <rworth> there's only one base event - create
[13:17:42] <gelegrodan> do i need to search the code to find all?
[13:17:54] <gelegrodan> for example changestart event
[13:17:58] <rworth> the methods (other than option) are destroy, disable, enable, and widget
[13:18:06] <gelegrodan> for accordion
[13:18:16] <rworth> changestart is already documented for accordion
[13:18:26] <gelegrodan> yes but lets pretned it wasnt
[13:18:40] <rworth> the only methods missing are the ones provided by the widget base class: destroy, disable, enable, option, widget
[13:18:44] <rworth> ok
[13:18:55] <rworth> so, you could check the source
[13:19:10] <gelegrodan> the only two places in the code it exists are "changestart: null" and "ret = _trigger.call( this, "changestart", event, data );"
[13:19:10] <rworth> or you could check the wiki page, which may have an up-to-date spec section
[13:19:24] <rworth> but we don't often keep spec sections up-to-date on wiki pages for stable widgets
[13:19:41] <rworth> as the code matures and the documentation ends up being the place to keep that info
[13:19:52] <rworth> right
[13:19:55] <gelegrodan> but is search for _trigger a good start?
[13:20:04] <rworth> for sure, that should give you events
[13:20:29] <rworth> but it wouldn't give you any events provided by widget, unless you're searching in the widget js file
[13:20:59] <gelegrodan> yes
[13:21:00] <gelegrodan> ofc
[13:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan, rworth: We should not be documenting 1.8 APIs
[13:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> There should not be a changestart event in the accordion docs.
[13:23:02] <rworth> hmm, good point
[13:23:13] <gelegrodan> i looked at master?
[13:23:20] <rworth> that's I guess the next step is review all the docs for changes between 1.8 and 1.9
[13:23:48] <rworth> could be next after documenting the base widget stuff I mean
[13:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: You would've found: _trigger.call( this, "changestart", event, data );
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> Which is in back-compat code.
[13:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> You can find a list of events at the top, in the options.
[13:25:05] <rworth> so we're not going to document the back-compat apis at all?
[13:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js#L47
[13:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we should.
[13:26:04] <rworth> I'm just thinking about how that will affect something that's on 1.8 or 1.9 back-compat or 1.10 back-compat for the next months-year
[13:26:10] <rworth> someone
[13:26:32] <rworth> it seems like a half-support, in code only, undocumented
[13:26:50] <rworth> maybe we should document it but mark it as deprecated="1.9" removed="2.0"
[13:27:01] <rworth> just like we have added="1.0" attributes
[13:27:15] <rworth> and maybe the site doesn't show them by default, you have to opt-in to view?
[13:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[13:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> There are conflicts, where it's impossible to document properly.
[13:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> There are 1.9 features that only exist if back-compat is turned off.
[13:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> Because the back-compat layer overwrites it.
[13:31:50] <rworth> let's just finish up the 1.8 docs as they are currently, in xml, tag it 1.8, then do 1.9 docs in master and only document 1.9
[13:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> Have we figured out how to show docs for old versions?
[13:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> Or are we not doing that?
[13:32:05] <rworth> then if someone needs 1.8 docs we can always generate those in the same way as 1.9 docs
[13:32:18] <rworth> yeah, I forgot we do have a plan for that
[13:32:23] <rworth> we'll use branches/tags
[13:32:33] <rworth> not sure how it will work with the url/slugs
[13:32:48] <rworth> but I'm sure we can figure something out, maybe like we do child pages on plugins.?
[13:33:20] <rworth> or we could do a subdomain: 1-8.api.jqueryui.com
[13:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm ok with subdomains.
[13:33:53] <rworth> that would give us simple stats on how often people are referencing docs for previous versions
[13:34:02] <rworth> and simplifies the rest of the url a ton
[13:34:14] <gelegrodan> scott_gonzalez: and the best way to find the methods (widget specific) are searchhin for "prototype." in the code i guess?
[13:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Would be easy to work with too, we just branch api.jqueryui.com for every release.
[13:34:22] <rworth> yup
[13:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: No, you won't find any methods that way.
[13:34:49] <rworth> but we'll only have subdomains for major versions
[13:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> You need to scan the prototype object (which is not referenced as prototype) for methods that don't start with an underscore.
[13:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, only major versions is fine.
[13:35:22] <rworth> another site to add to the list ;)
[13:36:18] <rworth> hmm, maybe we need to revisit download and themeroller as subdomains
[13:36:37] <rworth> download.jqueryui.com 1-8.download.jqueryui.com 1-9.download.jqueryui.com
[13:37:24] <rworth> and again, simple google analytics stats by site/domain
[13:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> We'll track download stats separately anyway.
[13:39:45] <rworth> true
[13:40:10] <rworth> I still like it better than /download and /themeroller, and now even more so
[13:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> DNS lookup overload!
[13:41:10] <rworth> :)
[13:42:12] <gelegrodan> so what did you guys decide about the docs? 1.8 or 1.9? what should be documentet? and how?
[13:42:40] <rworth> let's add the widget base stuff to the current docs and then tag/branch 1.8
[13:42:53] <rworth> then start ripping out 1.8-only stuff and add new 1.9 stuff
[13:43:49] <rworth> and we'll only ever revisit 1.8 to make schema changes, generally. It should theoretically be as frozen as the code (soon enough)
[13:48:51] <gelegrodan> ok
[13:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> gelegrodan: There are docs for redesigned widgets on the planning wiki.
[13:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Accordion will be correct for 1.9.
[13:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> Same for tabs and position.
[13:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> and autocomplete
[13:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> And for new widgets: spinner and tooltip.
[13:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> If it's crossed out here: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[13:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> Then the docs on the wiki are correct.
[13:56:13] <gelegrodan> prefect :)
[13:58:26] <gelegrodan> rworth: when will ube back?
[13:58:35] <rworth> Monday
[13:58:49] <gelegrodan> ok
