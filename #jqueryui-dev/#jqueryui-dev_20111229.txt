[05:40:02] <Moshe> hi scott_gonzalez
[05:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> hi Moshe
[05:40:50] <Moshe> I see you have updated the ticket I created
[05:41:34] <Moshe> I wasn't totally sure what you meant with your first comment, I hope the problem is a bit clearer now?
[05:42:01] <Moshe> (ticket 7972)
[05:42:38] <Moshe> I looked around a bit, but I'm not sure how to fix it so the 7255 bug is not re-introduced
[06:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I saw the bug in the updated fiddle, though you forgot to post the link to the updated revision :-P
[06:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> When I first tested it, I created http://jsfiddle.net/dtSB7/2/
[06:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> which alerts 313 (not 100 or 100.5), which makes sense to me
[06:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> since the green div is not positioned
[06:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> but I do see that style.left is actually set to 100.5 in the console (I hadn't checked the console before your comment)
[06:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> This might take a while to fix
[06:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> I *really* hate that Firefox supports fractions
[06:28:40] <Moshe> scott_gonzalez: ok, is firefox the only browser that supports that?
[06:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> I believe IE 10 added support for fractions as well
[06:29:35] <Moshe> I didn't know updated fiddles had their own url, I actually meant this version: http://jsfiddle.net/dtSB7/4/
[06:32:07] <Moshe> I use the ui.position with a few interactive elements, that behave oddly because they not moved exactly to where they want to be, thats how I discovered the weird rounding
[06:33:19] <Moshe> anyway, thanks for looking in to it, if I think of a fix, I'll let you know
[08:33:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah, more fun with position :P
[08:33:46] <bot-t> (50 hours 50 mins ago) <sadmicrowave> tell kborchers whats up
[08:49:27] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez meeting today?
[08:50:02] <kborchers> i guess that was yesterday ... was there a meeting?
[08:51:41] <kborchers> hard to remember what day it is when not working
[10:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: no meeting today
