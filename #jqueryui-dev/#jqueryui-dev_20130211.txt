[05:27:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away: I got two complaints out of http://gregfranko.com/blog/registering-the-jqueryui-widget-factory-as-an-amd-module/
[05:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> 1) I want to load the widget factory from a CDN and I can't.
[05:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> 2) I as a plugin developer want to use the widget factory and support AMD and I sort of can't.
[05:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> #1 seems silly to me.
[05:29:03] <scott_gonzalez> #2 seems easy to work around.

[18:15:25] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: so how DO we want to handle invalid values/
[18:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> I guess parseFloat( val ) || 0 ?
[18:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what else we could do.
[18:22:02] <petersendidit> yea, any invalid values you want to make sure we test for?
[18:22:13] <petersendidit> meaning have a unit test for
[18:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: I guess just anything that will produce NaN.
