[04:40:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping
[04:44:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:45:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So do tell me about your idea!
[04:45:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i changed the implementation to use this.element by default
[04:46:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its used in nearly every widget at least once
[04:46:28] <arschmitz> so why keep repeating it
[04:46:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, you mean for _elementsFromClassKey()?
[04:46:48] <arschmitz> yes
[04:47:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, but in some cases you /wanna/ return nothing at all.
[04:47:16] <arschmitz> yup so do it
[04:47:16] <gabriel_schulhof> What about this._classes( "xyzzy" )?
[04:47:51] <arschmitz> this.options.classes.inArray( classKey )
[04:47:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I guess this is all about widget implementations, so it's OK if classes apply to this.element by default.
[04:48:15] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/classes/ui/widget.js#L371
[04:48:44] <arschmitz> it actually eliminated the need to override it at all in the old ui buttonset widget
[04:48:49] <gabriel_schulhof> indexOf? That works with hashes too?
[04:49:27] <gabriel_schulhof> I would've thought if ( classKey in this.options.classes ) was the way to go.
[04:49:30] <arschmitz> oh shoot im an idiot your right i need to change that but you get the idea 
[04:49:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[04:49:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[04:49:53] <arschmitz> it makes the individual widgets simplier
[04:50:04] <arschmitz> just return anything thats not this.element
[04:50:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I made an implementation of this using just selectors, but scott_gonzalez rightly shot it down saying it's a footgun for widgets containing other widgets.
[04:50:42] <arschmitz> right and it would be slow
[04:51:00] <arschmitz> compared to using refrences 99% of the time
[04:51:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess you're right. No point using selectors. 
[04:51:30] <arschmitz> there is no way for it to work properly using selectors its not just a foot gun its impossible
[04:51:58] <arschmitz> because for some widgets theres no rules for markup and they can be nested
[04:52:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I was thinking if we used only direct descendancy, ... but no. You're right. We're already keeping track of the elements we want to affect, so why select for them ...
[04:52:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but some times its not about direct decendants some times things have complex markup
[04:52:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: for example tooltip
[04:52:51] <arschmitz> you can call it on body and it will work on any tooltip in the body
[04:52:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right. Exactly.
[04:53:03] <arschmitz> but then you can call it again on another div with in that with different options
[04:53:12] <arschmitz> at any level
[04:53:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, tooltip is definitely a weird one.
[04:53:30] <arschmitz> tooltips apply to anything with a title attribute dont have a container
[04:53:51] <arschmitz> and the actual markup they generate dynamically is created and removed constantly 
[04:54:01] <arschmitz> there is no way for it to work properly with selectors
[04:54:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So yeah, if this change trims down the code somewhat, then nuthin' but :+1:
[04:54:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... right, and it's not like you can forego the widget buy-in if you use selectors. You still need buy-in.
[04:55:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Just out of curiosity: did you diff --stat the code after removing the stuff made redundant by your change?
[04:55:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm wondering how much we're saving.
[04:55:59] <arschmitz> i didnt
[04:56:17] <gabriel_schulhof> If you have it pushed I can do it.
[04:56:47] <arschmitz> i do its not ready yet but what needs to be changed wont change the number of lines
[04:56:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: 
[04:56:57] <arschmitz> its in branch classes on ui
[04:57:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Speaking of savings ... I was able to simplify the hash processing demo. Remember I was looking into same-page transitions, and how to update the page to make it look like it's two pages?
[04:57:39] <arschmitz> yup
[04:57:50] <arschmitz> i was looking at the pr earlier 
[04:57:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I used .animationComplete() on the outgoing page. It fires precisely at the halfway point of the transition.
[04:58:01] <arschmitz> have really looked close yet though
[04:58:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: pagehide fires at the end of the transition.
[04:58:05] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ah cool
[04:58:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep, so I could get rid of the pagecontainertransition handler.
[04:58:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and since animationComplete is guranteed to always fire you may get slight timing issues but it will always work
[04:58:49] <gabriel_schulhof> So now there's only one handler: pagecontainerbeforechange, which attaches animationComplete.
[04:58:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[04:59:14] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and now the page disappears with the old string in the header and appears with the new string in the header.
[04:59:27] <gabriel_schulhof> So, it totally looks like a different page.
[04:59:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Even the active class on the button.
[04:59:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its too bad the widget which the update completely removed the need for overiding the method in is one that will never actually be updated lol 
[04:59:55] <gabriel_schulhof> It fades out, but when the button fades back in, it no longer has the active class.
[05:00:13] <arschmitz> perfect
[05:00:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep. Looks awesome now.
[05:01:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Of course, in a real scenario, the window may spend a lot of time in a blank state, if the page needs lots of updating.

[07:35:47] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06classes 141495ddd 15Alexander Schmitz: Tooltip: fixup debugging
[07:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's generally bad to have tabindex >0.
[07:41:26] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[07:42:31] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: If you set your select's tabindex to 2, we change it to -1, and that seems wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/5jqjfzvt/
[07:43:11] <tj_vantoll1> Well I should say we make the generated button's tabindex -1.
[07:44:08] <tj_vantoll1> I'm fine with always using 0 or -1 though.
[07:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, that's weird.
[07:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> Interestingly, it looks like there's already code to copy the tabindex.
[07:47:13] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah I was looking at that too.
[07:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it's bad boolean logic.
[07:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> Should be nested ternaries for what's trying to happen.
[07:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can leave this at least for now.
[07:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> And just fix it.
[07:48:07] <tj_vantoll1> That was my thought as well.
[07:48:18] <tj_vantoll1> We'll see if the OP addresses this, else we'll patch it ourselves.
[07:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> In the past I've closed tickets that asked for custom tabindex on generated elements.
[07:48:29] <tj_vantoll1> ok good to know
[07:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> I remember one asking to have a custom tabindex on accordion.
[07:48:48] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah tabindex > 0 is stupid.
[07:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, fixing the broken draw code won't be enough.
[07:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to store the tabindex on the instance.
[07:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> So that we can use it when you call .enable().
[07:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> And then we need tests for this.
[07:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> Which gets me back to not wanting to do it :-P
[07:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> Funny that this is coming up while there's a big push in the W3C to discourage tabindex >0, and possible even eliminate it.
[08:01:43] <tj_vantoll1> In that case I'd comment on the ticket to suggest we remove the code that does it entirely, but make it do 0 or -1 appropriately based on the disabled option.
[08:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[10:54:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I've found the root cause of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7793 ... I don't think we should work around it though. We should file a bug against Chrome, and document the workaround in the issue.
[10:55:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... depends though if the bug is present on old Android built-in browser ...
[10:57:02] <gabriel_schulhof> It's good on Android 2.3.5.
[10:58:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok did you see my comment already?
[10:59:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes. It's gonna be fun coming up with a minimal test case for Chrome.
[10:59:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Also, Chrome has two problems.
[11:00:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If you remove the vertical align, for some reason it introduces blank space between the rows of buttons.
[11:00:30] <gabriel_schulhof> That also seems incorrect.
[11:01:48] <gabriel_schulhof> It miscalculates the height of the select. It says it's 39px, but the border is well within that.
[11:03:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, actually, FF does the same, so ... hmmm ...
[11:04:26] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll concentrate on one problem at a time :)
[11:07:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: in your jsbin
[11:07:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: setting vertical align middle does nothing
[11:07:51] <arschmitz> delete the whole rule and nothing changes
[11:08:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its the setting of inital thats fixing it
[11:09:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know, but we need the rules for non-controlgroup buttons descending directly from the header/footer.
[11:10:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Having just the first rule will kill /all/ your header/footer buttons.
[11:10:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ah right
[11:10:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll comment in the jsbin to that effect.
[11:10:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh and the vertical space is correct
[11:10:32] <arschmitz> your changing the vertical alignment
[11:12:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, but how come the vertical space is not evenly distributed above and below the button when the vertical-align is turned on?
[11:13:07] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not sure i would ask jasper
[11:13:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, if there is extra vertical space, it should be split when the align is middle, so there should still be space between rows of buttons, just less space.
[11:13:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah ... that's why I assigned him.
[11:14:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Did I mention I fscking hate what has become of jsbin? The milestone system is totally fscked up.
[11:14:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no i think it makes sense
[11:14:55] <arschmitz> if you want to save a milestone just ctrl+s
[11:15:07] <gabriel_schulhof> That's how it used to work.
[11:15:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Doesn't work for me in either FF or Chrome.
[11:20:06] <gabriel_schulhof> I wish there was a way in dev tools to copy the DOM together with all the CSS rules that apply into a new document. That would make the creation of a simple test case so much easier.
[11:20:23] <lisa_deluca> if I make a change to .jshintrc do i need to run a command fromt he command line to tell grunt it's been updated?  doesn't appear to be taking my changes
[11:20:45] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: There are two .jshintrc files, IIRC.
[11:21:04] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: There's one in the repo root, and one in js/
[11:21:26] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: I dunno which one governs what, but maybe you wanna try your changes in both.

[11:32:12] <lisa_deluca> thoughts?
[11:34:07] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: thats not a jshint thing
[11:34:10] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: You must also specify that it is to count tabs as 4 spaces. If tabs are counted as a single character, the rule will be too lax.
[11:34:13] <arschmitz> jshint is dropping all style checking
[11:34:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right!
[11:34:32] <gabriel_schulhof> lisa_deluca: What arschmitz said.
[11:34:36] <arschmitz> its a jscs thing which is already in UI and will be moved to mobile once its ready
[11:34:53] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: gabriel_schulhof okay, fine!  I'll close the issue :)
[11:35:27] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: so not that its not a good idea but we are already on it ( and jshint is no longer supporting it )

[12:12:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabaum10 reopened issue #7784: After orientationchange event is triggered, listviews scroll back to the top 02http://git.io/9rUhnw
[13:38:43] <Omar-> I hope you dont mind my interference in #7784
[13:38:53] <Omar-> =)
[13:39:00] <arschmitz> Omar-: its a public tracker for a reason 
[13:39:19] <Omar-> wise answer arschmitz ;)
[13:39:22] <Omar-> how are you?
[13:44:52] <Omar-> arschmitz i was able to reproduce the problem on Safari but not Chrome (ipad and iphone ios 8.0.2)
[13:45:46] <Omar-> when orientationchange is triggered, it triggers scoll which results in returning a different scrollTop 
[13:47:28] <Omar-> but it doesn't scroll to top as he mentions now
[13:50:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Does http://jsbin.com/waxulu/ wrap in a weird fashion for you in Chrome, as you make the window ever-narrower (thus reproducing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7793)?
[13:51:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's as minimal a test case as I could make it.
[13:53:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[13:53:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:54:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and that seems like a reasonable test case
[13:54:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I mean, I got rid of as much markup and CSS as possible./
[13:54:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm gonna check Chrome Canary to see if I've wasted my time.
[13:55:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Unfortunately, Chrome wants you to install it system-wide :(
[13:55:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So I have to fire up a new VM, because I sure as heck don't want to upset my native state.
[13:55:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah thats one nice thing on android
[13:55:31] <arschmitz> they are actually different aps
[13:55:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool! So, you can run them side-by-side ... sweet!
[13:55:56] <arschmitz> yup
[13:57:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: interesting even applying vertical align:initial to everything does not seem to fix here...
[13:58:00] <Omar-> arschmitz regarding #7784 shall I open a ticket for safari triggers "scroll" on "orientationchange"?
[13:59:07] <arschmitz> Omar-: those are both native events so you would have to file that on the bugtracker for webkit
[13:59:19] <arschmitz> Omar-: which i would encourage you to do
[14:02:39] <Omar-> arschmitz: you mean https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/
[14:06:31] <arschmitz> Omar-: https://bugs.webkit.org/
[14:12:11] <Omar-> arschmitz thanks, will do now
[14:14:21] <arschmitz> Omar-: thanks!
[14:31:28] <Omar-> arschmitz scroll is triggered when changing orientation from landscape to portrait
[14:31:36] <Omar-> now this is weird
[14:35:55] <Omar-> when the page is empty with fixed toolbars only, it doesn't trigger
[14:36:13] <Omar-> obviously because there's no content to scroll
[14:37:20] <Omar-> i'll postpone opening a ticket on bugtracker until i do more tests
[14:39:49] <Omar-> goodnight everyone!

[15:18:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Fixed in Chromium as of the latest build, so I guess it should trickle down into Chrome at some point.
[15:20:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can we close the issue? (#7793)?
[15:21:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Moral of the story: Always grab the absolute bleeding-edgest Chromium from build.chromium.org and test with that.
