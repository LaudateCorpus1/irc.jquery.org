[01:15:59] <eagspoo> In jqm, is there no such thing as content outside of a page?  Like a persistent footer like when using bartender?   Instead should I duplicate the footer in each page?
[07:41:29] <toddmparker> morning
[07:42:04] <toddmparker> I got an email asking for a UI expert with some drag and drop stuff - anyone interested in a referral?
[08:15:01] <arschmitz> kborchers: so it looks like all well be good on wp8 without pointer, will just require one super major change
[08:15:21] <arschmitz> *super minor
[08:36:07] <kborchers> arschmitz: nice
[08:36:30] <arschmitz> kborchers: right now you can only drag slider handles about 40px at a time
[08:37:36] <arschmitz> but just setting touch-action=pan-y pinch-zoom double-tap-zoom; on the slider fixes it
[08:37:49] <arschmitz> and everything else iv tested seems to work
[08:39:08] <arschmitz> gota say more i work with pointer events the more they make sense and will make a lot of things a lot easier
[08:39:17] <kborchers> yep
[08:43:00] <arschmitz> kborchers: think microsoft may have actually gotten it right with this one :)
[08:43:21] <kborchers> :)
[09:06:14] <agcolom> oh magic, I'm back to agcolom!
[09:07:07] <agcolom> irclcoud is playing up :-(
[09:08:49] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do we have meeting now?
[09:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Wrong day.
[09:10:05] <rxaviers> jezzz
[09:10:14] <rxaviers> it's tue
[09:10:15] <rxaviers> nevermind
[09:10:18] <gseguin> agcolom: use limechat or other irc client and connect to the jQuery znc server
[09:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:10:26] <gseguin> agcolom: much better solution
[09:11:09] <agcolom> gseguin: normally irccloud is not bad, but today really not great!
[09:11:30] <agcolom> gseguin: will try that, thanks
[09:11:53] <gseguin> agcolom: ask the infra team for an account
[09:14:13] <agcolom> ok, will do, thanks :-)
[09:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> Everyone stand back, I'm writing CSS...
[09:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> Does this seem sane to use?
[09:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> .top-labels input[type=checkbox] + label:after
[09:21:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: http://i.imgur.com/SFiKiLI.gif
[09:21:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, :after is supported on IE78+ according to http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize/
[09:21:18] <rxaviers> ops IE8+
[09:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: http://cl.ly/image/1P2A273h0k1R
[09:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Our sites are IE8+
[09:21:43] <rxaviers> ;)
[09:21:45] <rxaviers> so, ok
[09:22:26] <rxaviers> the others like + or [] are (theoretically) supported on IE7+
[09:23:26] <rxaviers> im not an expert, but I think you're good
[09:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> Holy crap. Working in HTML is so painful compared to markdown when you're trying to write large code blocks.
[09:50:35] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: perfect!
[09:50:44] <_zoggy_> rxaviers, http://caniuse.com/#search=%3Aafter
[09:50:56] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: that was for the screenshot
[10:11:37] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, good site

[13:57:12] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, with all respect, that manifest thing is getting a mess
[13:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see why you think this is messy.
[13:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> 3rd parties should have a function to call to get the data they want.
[13:57:44] <rxaviers> I mean this _ thing
[13:57:55] <rxaviers> the full merged docs are an array
[13:58:17] <rxaviers> which is not valid according the registry.
[13:58:49] <rxaviers> if it's ok that UI have more featured manifests, why dont we include another field then. But, we make it unique
[13:58:53] <rxaviers> to JSON files and to DB
[13:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> Because nobody else is consuming this and copying individual files.
[13:59:25] <rxaviers> if we have a another docs field that means the pages when docs is a category
[13:59:56] <rxaviers> "docsChildren" <- this name sucks.. but, just to give an idea
[14:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> Wasn't there more than just docs?
[14:00:24] <rxaviers> demos
[14:00:33] <rxaviers> but, it's the same thing.. like: "demosChildren"
[14:00:41] <rxaviers> wait
[14:00:58] <rxaviers> let me double check.. perhaps it's only docs. Because, we unite the demos
[14:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Where is your gist?
[14:04:43] <rxaviers> yeap, the spread effect demos we use to have are now into effect/
[14:04:46] <rxaviers> so, this is solved
[14:04:51] <rxaviers> the docs are the only ad-hoc thing
[14:12:19] <rxaviers> jeeez, I re-read myself above and I didn't understand what I said.. Just trying to make myself a little clearer:
[14:13:22] <rxaviers> Having the underscore `_` thing on our manifests seems to be making it harder. Exception rules are evil.
[14:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> There's no exceptions.
[14:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> There are two functions, which each return different, but similar, data.
[14:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> One is a full set of data, one is filtered for the plugin registry.

[15:24:30] <arschmitz> Seb-: for questions please go to #jquery first suggestion is going to be to update to latest version though
[15:28:40] <Seb-> arschmitz: thanks, I just contacted the author :) it's a purchased template and there's no stack trace. I tried ;)
[15:29:21] <arschmitz> ah ok
[16:57:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is there a way to take the category and figure out what the pages are by using api.jqueryui.com?
[16:58:29] <rxaviers> If so, we don't need to change anything on current manifests. Download Builder can process the category into its page docs.
[17:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Not without parsing every page individually.

[23:18:32] <sammichToo> hi all, my slider doesn't want to seem to do anything when I go: $('input').val(50).slider('refresh')
[23:20:49] <sammichToo> I see the topic. Back to #jquery I go
