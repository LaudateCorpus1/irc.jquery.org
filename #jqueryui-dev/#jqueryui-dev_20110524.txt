[10:45:55] <gnarf> rworth: once you get some time, I'd like to chat/clap re fx docs...
[10:46:21] <gnarf> rworth: or in the near future / whatever -- right now i gotta head into the day job for a few hours or they'll miss me ;)
[10:57:28] <rworth> gnarf: ok, let me know when
[12:14:38] <gnarf> anyone who cares: http://oksoclap.com/WMe70bf9pg -- starting to draft up some random things to say about jQuery.Color v2 beta for a blog post... Any ideas / thoughts?
[12:14:59] <gnarf> rworth: slow day at work ;)
[12:15:39] <gnarf> rworth: so, one thing I noticed while trying to start docs for effects
[12:16:08] <gnarf> is that it's going to be kinda like a "selector" xml format, in that each effect isn't a method, its an argument to another method
[12:16:18] <gnarf> with options
[12:16:20] <gnarf> etc
[12:17:18] <gnarf> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-docs/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L81 -- needs to pick up that format
[12:18:32] <gnarf> its not going to have a "Signature" either I don't think
[12:20:53] <gnarf> so, it has options like a widget - etc
