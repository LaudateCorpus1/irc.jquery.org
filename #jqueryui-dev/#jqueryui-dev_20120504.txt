[05:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> Why would we test in Firefox 10 if it's not a supported browser?
[05:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> Also, 3.6 is EOL.

[10:44:18] <clarkbox> krinkle, scott_gonzalez. ESR is "extended support release". if there is a large proportion of users on that release, we might want to keep an eye on it.
[10:44:33] <Krinkle> right
[10:44:36] <clarkbox> http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all.html
[10:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: We don't support it.
[10:44:55] <clarkbox> maybe we could reach out to moz and find out if they have large adoption.
[10:45:10] <clarkbox> ok, thanks fine then scott
[10:45:26] <clarkbox> i wasnt aware of the policy. guess i should be
[10:46:21] <clarkbox> is core going to start using swarm again?
[10:49:14] <scott_gonzalez> I think jzaefferer was waiting on something for that?
[10:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> Suports is current - 1.
[10:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> For everything except IE.
[10:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility
[10:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it hasn't been updated since Firefox 3.6 EOL
[10:57:08] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Once we get around https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/170, I'm hoping jQuery projects in testswarm can go back to relying on real-world usage rather than hand-picked browsers like it is now
[10:57:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #170 on testswarm (Krinkle; 1m, 55s ago): Refactor browserSets and implement "global browser usage" data
[10:57:57] <Krinkle> Ofcourse the official compatibility badge can stay on "Current -1", that's fine.
[11:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure why that should be built into TestSwarm.
[11:20:43] <johnbender> Krinkle: I think if you turned https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki/Automated-Distributed-Continuous-Integration-for-JavaScript
[11:20:55] <johnbender> into a blog post the HN kiddies would likely loose it in their pants
[11:21:04] <Krinkle> HN ?
[11:21:18] <johnbender> Krinkle: Hacker News
[11:21:23] <Krinkle> how so
[11:21:34] <johnbender> Krinkle: the title alone
[11:21:46] <johnbender> Automated Distributed Continuous Integration for JavaScript
[11:21:52] <Krinkle> Great, isn't it?
[11:22:02] <Krinkle> In a good way?
[11:22:04] <johnbender> It is extremely sexy
[11:22:07] <Krinkle> (loose it)
[11:22:11] <Krinkle> Oh, right.
[11:22:20] <Krinkle> Maybe I'm confused with a dutch saying
[11:22:41] <Krinkle> where "peeing in your pants" is part of an expresssion/saying to emphasizing laughing
[11:22:47] <Krinkle> thx :D
[11:22:59] <johnbender> loose it in their pants ≡ like it alot
[11:23:03] <Krinkle> gotcha
[11:23:27] <johnbender> poor choice of phrase
[11:23:33] <Krinkle> np
[11:57:55] <Krinkle> clarkbox: johnbender to make it a little sweeter I added a TL;DR end result at the end

[12:01:20] <Krinkle> or http://thehackernews.com/ ?
[12:01:28] <clarkbox> first
[12:01:29] <Krinkle> or www.hackernews.com ?
[12:01:30] <Krinkle> :P
[12:01:36] <Krinkle> google is full of it
[12:01:44] <Krinkle> ok
[12:02:14] <Krinkle> Hm.. is it like digg or reedit ?
[12:02:17] <Krinkle> reddit*
[12:02:21] <Krinkle> never heard of it
[12:03:03] <clarkbox> ya just a popular community. run by a popular VC
[12:03:20] <clarkbox> maybe get this as a jquery-ui blog post first
[12:03:26] <clarkbox> then submit that to HN
[12:03:52] <Krinkle> jquery-ui or general jq?
[12:06:59] <clarkbox> general maybe. not my call. ask davemethvin maybe
[13:28:06] <rworth> nacin ping
[13:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ZOMG ASPLODE
[13:36:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, whenever you're around, we ran into a funny problem which took forever to track down.
[13:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> The URL rewrites that you implemented for staging are affecting descriptions in terms.
[13:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> That's probably legit behavior, but it's killing XML-RPC.
[13:37:37] <scott_gonzalez> I assume what's happening is the XML-RPC server calculates the length of the content before the rewrite, so the response is being truncated.
[13:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I just had a thought...
[13:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, maybe I shouldn't say this out loud :-P
[13:52:33] <Krinkle> lolderbolderlollol, this thread is hilarious https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3057
[13:52:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3057 on bootstrap (englishextra; 3w, 4h ago): bootstrap-dropdown.js clearMenus() needs ; at the end
[14:07:06] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: hello
[14:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> hey nacin
[14:07:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I never implement that thinking about XML-RPC
[14:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> So we've got a term with a description that contains "blog.jquery.com"
[14:09:22] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: try now on jq01
[14:09:45] <nacin> or do this: if ( JQUERY_STAGING && ! defined( 'XMLRPC_REQUEST' ) ) ob_start( 'jquery_com_staging_urls' );
[14:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it's working. Though I hadn't tested with the staging server before.
[14:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Richard was getting the problem and I had only tested locally.
[14:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> He was getting the problem locally too, so we debugged on his machine.
[14:12:29] <nacin> but you guys were using the output buffer, right?
[14:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> He was, yeah.
[14:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, he was using whatever you wrote for the rewrites. I assume that was the output buffer.
[14:13:06] <nacin> right. so the fix is to check XMLRPC_REQUEST as well. I put it live on jq01.stage and then pasted it in here in case you were using it locally.
