[04:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: The handles option should either be documented or removed. I would honestly prefer to remove it, justl ike we don't expose any draggable options.
[04:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> Kinda feels like we missed our chance with that having released 1.10.0 already.
[04:43:35] <scott_gonzalez> We should see what the rest of the team thinks. If everyone wants to drop it, we can deprecate it in 1.11.
[04:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Let's not give out illegal advice in a public forum: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/877#issuecomment-12644876
[04:51:18] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, pull request #877 by jzaefferer (3w 38m ago): Selectmenu ARIA tweaks
[05:03:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding dialog handles, deprecation in 1.11 seems good.
[05:04:49] <jzaefferer> as for the advice - JAWS actively tells you that you have to restart your computer to continue running the demo.
[05:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: They also tell you that you are not allowed to use it the way you do.
[05:05:56] <jzaefferer> oh well
[05:06:03] <jzaefferer> should I delete that part of my comment?
[05:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> probably

[05:29:01] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, that's why i haven't tested in JAWS. i'll try to get a comparison to that branch later today
[05:29:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i would vote remove the handles option
[05:38:31] <fnagel> Sounds like JAWS is asking to drop support for their softwares...
[05:40:33] <fnagel> Did anoyne try to get some free licences for jQuery UI from Fredom Scientific?
[06:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> fnagel: We haven't tried because what we've heard is that they don't do that sort of thing.
[06:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> I can certainly reach out to them though.
[06:07:50] <fnagel> Ok. Sounds ridiculous and counterproductive for their company  to me... 
[06:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> yup

[06:20:55] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/893 Yea good catch
[06:20:56] <b-ot> petersendidit, pull request #893 by petersendidit (12h 49m ago): Dialog: Don't handle overlays on destory if there are not any. Fixed: #9...
[06:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> We probably need to track the overlay instance per dialog instance.
[06:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> Which we used to do.
[06:21:47] <petersendidit> Seems like if we set this.overlay = null after removing it and then only knock down the $.ui.dialog.overlayInstances if this.overlay exists that should work
[06:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:24:52] <petersendidit> Seems like we are ok with a overlay per dialog right
[06:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> Don't we have that now?
[06:25:56] <petersendidit> Yea
[06:26:03] <petersendidit> just want to make sure that thats what we want
[06:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's what we want.
[06:35:39] <bak2helll> hi, can i ask a jquery question here?
[06:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> bak2helll: ask in #jquery for support
[06:36:34] <bak2helll> ok
[06:40:21] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/f6a6a72a205ed71d524d
[06:40:36] <petersendidit> seems like that covers the test cases
[06:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yup
[06:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want to close the second one at the end to make sure the overlays are all gone.
[06:43:06] <petersendidit> will destroy it since this is the "destroy" tests
[07:23:01] <djQuery> I was working on a modification to the dialog that allowed multiple buttons in the area that is typically holds the close button
[07:23:35] <djQuery> would the project be intrested in this? or should I just submit it as a plugin
[07:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Submit it as a plugin, but if you need us to refactor any of the internals to make that easier, just let us know or send a PR.
[07:40:46] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, is there a current tutorial on widget?
[07:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> Not really. There's http://blog.nemikor.com/2010/05/15/building-stateful-jquery-plugins/
[07:42:02] <scott_gonzalez> and http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[07:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> and https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs
[07:43:35] <djQuery> This has always been I favorite http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[07:46:49] <djQuery> I was looking at trying to tackle some of the dialog bugs and ran across this one. http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8984  Is it valid to to have a modal when using the appendTo option?
[07:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> But the overlay is still full page.
[07:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> And that's what's causing the problem.
[07:47:54] <djQuery> or should the overlay just be appended to the same item that the dialog is appended to using the rest of the screen still being able to be interacted with?
[07:48:43] <djQuery> ^^ leaving the rest of the page able to be interacted with
[07:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> We don't really want to get into that.
[07:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> It complicates a lot of stuff.
[07:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> Modals are bad enough for UX. Partial modals seem even worse.
[07:50:42] <djQuery> agreed 
[07:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> Fixed position will break out of any container, right?
[07:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> Regardless of ancestor position and overflow?
[07:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> So it should be as simple as appending to the same element as the dialog.
[08:08:38] * djQuery admits I suck at CSS, which is why I love jquery ui
[08:16:47] <djQuery> hmmm the documentation states that this is expected behavior Regardless of the value set, the overlay for modal dialogs will always be appended to the body and cover the entire window. (version added: 1.10)
[08:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but we can append to a different element and still cover the entire window.
[08:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> Unless anyone knows of a browser where fixed position elements will be contained/positioned based on an ancestor.
[08:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that the overlay may appear behind other elements on the page because of z-index
[08:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> maybe...
[08:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure how stacking contexts and fixed position elements interact.
[08:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you remember if we had to do anything special for fixed scrolling with Lowe's?
[08:20:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: well, lots, but mostly because they wanted stacking of multiple fixed elements
[08:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> I mean in terms of z-index and stacking.
[08:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> We kept the elements in place in the DOM, right?
[08:21:11] <jzaefferer> yeah, I think so
[08:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, looks like it (checking the code now).
[08:21:43] <jzaefferer> same here
[08:21:48] <jzaefferer> no mention of append
[08:22:01] <jzaefferer> but then then it never got into production anywhere, just our testpages
[08:22:31] <jzaefferer> I want a plugin that does the fixing for just a single element, no crazy stacking
[08:22:46] <jzaefferer> basically what facebook does...
[08:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I wrote the code for that while I was at iContact.
[08:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> I called it $.fn.fuckingAwesome()
[08:23:04] <jzaefferer> haha
[08:32:07] <djQuery> geez that was too easy .appendTo( this.options.appendTo || this.document[0].body );
[08:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: So easy that it's wrong :-P
[08:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> You need to use this._appendTo() to find the element.
[08:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> appendTo is a tricky thing
[08:34:31] <scott_gonzalez> I think we implemented it wrong everywhere at first.
[08:34:41] <djQuery> lol all I added was the or statement the rest was code allready there
[08:35:52] <djQuery> so is there a seperate bug that we need to go through the whole thing and replace appendTo with _appendTo?
[08:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> You're not replacing appendTo() with _appendTo().
[08:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> _appendTo() returns the element to append to.
[08:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't do the appending.
[08:37:12] <djQuery> ahhh cool thanks
[08:44:03] <djQuery> k think I got it complete now. http://jsbin.com/ezatot/3/edit
[08:44:20] <djQuery> just would this entail additional unit tests? 
[08:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> That jsbin is kind of hosed.
[08:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's using 1.9.2.
[08:59:48] <gnarf> broke a million downloads since we started recording in splunk
[09:03:31] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO
[09:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> I actually want to have a blog post about download builder.
[09:27:18] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, may I help?
[09:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Of course.
[09:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, if you want to start it, you'll probably get to it before me.
[09:28:12] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:28:34] <rxaviers> what would you like to emphisize in the blog post?
[09:28:54] <rxaviers> stats / technology
[09:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, the technology behind it, our stats (daily, and the 1M mark), what you're working on now.
[09:30:52] <rxaviers> today, I havent yet. but, my plan is to figure out what's wrong with the bad gateway thing
[09:33:06] <rxaviers> it'd be better to attract more traffic to it if it's fixed :)
[09:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:42:31] <rxaviers> :)
[09:45:57] <rxaviers> unbelievable, I play with it and dont get bad gateway
[09:47:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, do you remember how you got https://gist.github.com/3366f10f350f791f8847 ? The url is wrong, there should be a & between downloadParams and zThemeParams that apparently had been encoded.
[09:50:39] <rxaviers> I go back and forth, change themes, change selected components and I dont get problem :/
[09:51:09] <rxaviers> aha got it
[09:53:10] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you're welcome ;)
[09:53:31] <rxaviers> I got another problematic url
[09:53:33] <rxaviers> will update the gist
[09:53:45] <rxaviers> and url is correctly encoded :S
[10:00:58] <jzaefferer> so bit.ly said its not a valid URL. Maybe run it through a URL validator that can point at the invalid part?
[10:02:48] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, does it say it's not valid beacuse the querystring is invalid or because bit.ly can't fetch its contents (gets bad gateway)?
[10:03:00] <jzaefferer> I have no idea
[10:03:04] <jzaefferer> could be the latter
[10:03:07] <jzaefferer> good point
[10:03:30] <jzaefferer> let me verify that
[10:03:43] <jzaefferer> nope, that's not the problem
[10:03:55] <jzaefferer> http://doesnofwanifawintexist.com/ gets shortened just fine
[10:04:15] <rxaviers> interesting
[10:05:23] <rxaviers> although, if you keep the same querystring. But, replace the hostname to http://download.jqueryui.com/, bit.ly shortens it..
[10:09:13] <jzaefferer> I'm not following
[10:09:18] <jzaefferer> what are you replacing?
[10:10:15] <rxaviers> you know the last jqueryui url you tried do shorten using bitly.
[10:10:18] <rxaviers> that one
[10:11:07] <rxaviers> it said it's not a valid URL. But, if you take that same URL and add download before jqueryui.com, it works.
[10:11:11] <gnarf> rxaviers: lemme see if i can turn on debug logging for a second and catch that rewrite
[10:11:40] <rxaviers> great!!
[10:11:41] <rxaviers> :)
[10:12:48] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, so, it's not due to the querystring part it says it's invalid. Actually, it's not due the hostname neither. Agree?
[10:13:39] <gnarf> hey rxaviers if you add a trailing slash on /download/ it fixes it
[10:13:41] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I have no idea what's going on. Sucks
[10:14:00] <gnarf>  /download doesn't proxy
[10:14:08] <gnarf>  /download/ does
[10:15:19] <rxaviers> let's make sure we are all in the same page. We're talking about this url:
[10:15:21] <rxaviers> fails https://gist.github.com/3366f10f350f791f8847#comment-750131
[10:15:28] <rxaviers> works https://gist.github.com/3366f10f350f791f8847#comment-750135
[10:16:01] <rxaviers> gnarf, do you know what happens with the failing one in terms of proxing/rewriting?
[10:16:14] <rxaviers> (happen*)
[10:16:19] <gnarf> rxaviers: all the urls there work if you add /download/
[10:17:08] <rxaviers> ah! trailing slash
[10:17:21] <gnarf> rxaviers: yeah, its having trouble without the trailing slash
[10:17:35] <gnarf> not sure why
[10:17:40] <rxaviers> interesting..
[10:17:52] <gnarf> digging a bit more
[10:18:11] <gnarf> but i'm sure it has to do with how we do try_files { $uri $uri/ /index.php
[10:18:24] <rxaviers> aaah!
[10:18:38] <rxaviers> will open this file and think as well
[10:22:35] <gnarf> 2013/01/24 06:49:10 [error] 26137#0: *3232 upstream sent too big header while reading response header from upstream, client: 62.236.91.16, server: stage.jquer
[10:22:35] <gnarf> yui.com
[10:22:57] <gnarf> So what I think is happening is that the Location: /download/?......... header is bombing out nginx
[10:23:05] <gnarf> when it adds the trailing slash
[10:23:46] <rxaviers> so, when we add the trailing slash, it works for the client. But, prints an error on the server?
[10:26:00] <gnarf> no
[10:26:04] <gnarf> thats without the slash
[10:27:47] <gnarf> there
[10:29:21] <gnarf> the links should have a trailing slash in the first place
[10:31:21] <rxaviers> It seemed to me what you said about try_files were going in the right path tracking this issue down. But, if it's about the size of the header, now Im confused again
[10:32:35] <rxaviers> because the header size should be the same (with or without the training slash)
[10:34:10] <gnarf> rxaviers: so, what happens
[10:34:17] <gnarf> when you do /download?.....
[10:34:22] <gnarf> it gets passed to wordpress
[10:34:23] <gnarf> which says
[10:34:25] <gnarf> oh
[10:34:29] <gnarf> this page is at /download/
[10:34:32] <gnarf> so it responds with
[10:34:39] <gnarf> Location: /download/?......
[10:34:46] <gnarf> and that ^^^ header is too long for nginx
[10:35:11] <gnarf> at least at default buffer configuration
[10:35:33] <gnarf> your links work now
[10:35:37] <gnarf> please add the trailing slash tho
[10:35:47] <rxaviers> I see, ok.
[10:36:00] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/compare/00cd5097ce95...2b8c22701bc2
[10:36:21] <rxaviers> I got a 404 above
[10:36:55] <rxaviers> is it priv?
[10:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: added
[10:38:48] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez thks
[10:38:58] <rxaviers> gnarf, alright, great thanks for the help
[10:39:10] <rxaviers> I will make the trailing slash update
[10:39:37] <gnarf> rxaviers: you weren't on infra? sorry
[10:52:13] <djQuery> when using http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js  there is no version?  $.ui.version just returns @VERSION
[10:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: That's correct.
[10:52:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a released version, it's whatever is in git at the moment.
[10:55:25] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, think I got it fixed http://jsbin.com/ezatot/4/edit
[10:55:35] <djQuery> now to just research how to create unit tests

[11:55:13] <gnarf> rxaviers: nope - but i think it currently causes an interesting side effect, it tires to checkout commit 000000000000000000000 which doesn't exist
[11:58:58] <rxaviers> I've ssh'ed build machine and checked DB is running on 1.10.0-5 tag, which is the correct one
[11:59:11] <rxaviers> so I think we're good
[11:59:53] <rxaviers> I hope deploy script doesnt keep trying to deploy a failed tag.
[12:08:44] <jzaefferer> So the Location header was too long? Fun fun fun...
[12:08:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah
[12:09:02] <jzaefferer> gnarf: where is that log you looked at?
[12:09:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: its the error log, you can turn on debug logging and then parse through a WAY TO VERBOSE error log for EVERY REQUEST
[12:09:29] <gnarf> its very annyoing
[12:09:39] <jzaefferer> ugh
[12:09:45] <gnarf>  /var/log/nginx/stage.jqueryui.com.error.log on jq02.stage
[12:09:45] <jzaefferer> that sucks
[12:10:45] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: when you happen to push a bad tag, don't delete them, instead push a new tag for a good (old) commit
[12:11:02] <jzaefferer> you can tag any commit at any time
[12:11:46] <rxaviers> but we already had a v1.10.0-4 (without the v). That would be a lot confusing
[12:12:15] <rxaviers> same for v1.10.1-0
[12:12:17] <rxaviers> sorry about that
[12:14:13] <rxaviers> I was testing `npm version` :S
[12:15:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, worse than making a mistake is to make the same mistake, and believe or not I made it on jqueryui.com aff
[12:15:29] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, we have 1.10.0-3 and v1.10.0-3 (created by `npm version`)
[12:15:48] <rxaviers> do you think we should leave both, or may I delete duplicated v1.10.0-3?
[12:22:10] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, delete the v-duplicate
[12:22:15] <rxaviers> ok
[12:22:29] <rxaviers> done

[12:54:16] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: nice!
[12:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, looks good.
[12:54:25] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: shall I poke some holes in?
[12:54:27] <rxaviers> :)
[12:54:33] <rxaviers> Sure!

[13:32:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, images want ready. Reverted. If you still find anything plz just let me know.
[13:38:08] <rxaviers> Summary, it's back working with bad-gateway fixed (without new images)
[13:38:47] <rxaviers> - with components flag mask too
[13:39:26] <rxaviers> (instead of zipping components, what makes page faster)
[13:52:55] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #937: STILL FAILING in 46 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/937/
[13:52:55] <doesallmagic> public: Dialog: Don't handle overlays on destory if there are not any. Fixed: #9004 - failed in _destroyOverlay when I destroy a modal dialog thau was never opened. Fixed: #9000 Dialog leaves broken event handler after close/destroy in certain cases
[14:28:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: until we get this working properly, can you do some smoke testing (click around a bit) after a deploy? That last one was a little too obvious, wasn't it?
[14:29:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that said, you're doing great work! Looking forward to having the image thingy really done, since there's much more interesting things waiting :-)
[15:00:39] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, absolutely, I agree and thanks ;)
