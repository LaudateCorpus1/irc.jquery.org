[07:32:15] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: morning. the default appendTo for draggable is null in 2.0, which then goes to doc body. the old default was string 'parent' .....  does that mean while backCompat is there it will default to parent?
[07:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Only if they're using a helper.
[07:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's a tricky one.
[07:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> Remember that appendTo in master only applies to helpers.
[07:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> But in 2.0, it always applies.
[07:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> And null actually means null.
[07:43:35] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Ah yeah I'll go look back at that shortly, gotta hotfix something got sidetracked
[08:00:28] <Dave_Stein> just switched to git from svn recently so hotfixing is a bit more fun now
[08:02:11] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: So in backCompat am I saying that if there is no helper set appendTo back to null?
[08:03:08] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov also as per yesterday, is there something I'm doing wrong via grunt? It complains about all the unused vars in callback headers that I thought we wanted via code review
[08:03:56] <mikesherov> No, we don't want unused vars
[08:04:17] <mikesherov> If JSHint is complaining about them, then you're grunting correctly :-)
[08:06:36] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: okay time to cut out those vars
[08:07:33] <mikesherov> right, like even though callbacks all get passed (event, ui), if you're not using ui, don't include it in the anonymous function definition
[08:08:00] <Dave_Stein> we must have misunderstood each other at some point because i remember you saying jshint will be smarter than whatever i was doing haha
[08:08:07] <mikesherov> right...
[08:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: That was about not using event in ( event, ui )
[08:08:30] <mikesherov> JSHint is smart enough that if you ARE using `ui`, but not `event`, and you use (event, ui), it won't complain about `event`
[08:08:37] <Dave_Stein> ahhhhh
[08:08:50] <mikesherov> :-)
[08:08:53] <mikesherov> lightbulb
[08:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: re: appendTo: you shouldn't be setting it *back* to null, because it shouldn't not be null in the first place.
[08:11:17] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: i guess if some guy set appendTo without ever setting helper they are using it wrong anyway
[08:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> If someone sets appendTo, you should definitely not be changing it to anything else.
[08:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing you should be doing is changing null -> 'parent' if there's a clone.
[08:12:13] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Is 'parent' still a valid value in 2.0?
[08:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> no
[08:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want to set it to the actual element.
[08:13:02] <Dave_Stein> that's what I thought
[08:13:30] <Dave_Stein> so there is a small problem then I think
[08:13:43] <Dave_Stein> cause the dragEl is set, then appendTO is checked an appended
[08:14:02] <Dave_Stein> there are no events in between for a backcompat to latch onto and say "convert 'parent' to this.dragEl.parent()
[08:14:28] <Dave_Stein> because the parent can def change over time and hchanging options
[08:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need events, just add another method.
[08:15:27] <Dave_Stein> ok that was my thinking too but was unsure if you didn't want me polluting the main widget for the backcompat
[08:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally we don't.
[08:15:37] <Dave_Stein> cause the functions existance will only be there to be overwritten for the bakccompat
[08:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> There should be a comment to remove the method after 2.0.
[08:15:59] <Dave_Stein> ok cool
[08:16:43] <Dave_Stein> at least after this widget I'll know all the rules for backCompat and bug you less about these things
[08:18:59] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: I'm not entirely sure about the draggable testNumber 26 that's failing currently
[08:19:19] <Dave_Stein> it loops through a buncha values for cancel and 2 of them are af unction and i certainly didn't code for that
[08:19:28] <Dave_Stein> but i am clueless how the return'' passes but return true; fails
[08:20:01] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: are your latest changes pushed up
[08:20:16] <mikesherov> I'll pull the branch to see what you're talking about
[08:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Just remove the tests for function.
[08:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> That was never documented.
[08:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even know that existed.
[08:21:13] <Dave_Stein> cool
[08:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's fine to drop back compat for stuff that was never documented.
[08:21:23] <mikesherov> word
[08:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, disappearing for a bit.
[08:23:17] <Dave_Stein> kk
[08:24:03] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: btw i learned yesterday i can't run grunt from git bash but i can from cygwin :)
[08:24:14] <mikesherov> yup
[08:24:20] <mikesherov> windows
[08:24:35] <Dave_Stein> ftw!
[08:24:45] <mikesherov> just wait for the fun you'll have once jquery-ui upgrades to Grunt 0.4
[08:24:49] <Dave_Stein> did you hear the big behance news yesterday btw?
[08:25:04] <Dave_Stein> if by my fun, you mean me complaining to ben ;)
[08:26:00] <Ashley_> Hello
[08:26:53] <Ashley_> Just swinging by to tell you that in Safari (both mac and windows) jQuery UIs Selectmenu isn't keyboard accessible.
[08:27:20] <Dave_Stein> it would be better to file a bug report
[08:27:31] <Dave_Stein> fnagel is the guy who heads that up and he's not here
[08:27:38] <Dave_Stein> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[08:28:04] <Dave_Stein> thx for the heads up 
[08:29:11] <kborchers> Ashley_: Selectmenu is not a supported widget yet. any discussion about that should happen here http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[08:29:14] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: ^
[08:29:34] <Dave_Stein> ahhh
[08:29:39] <Dave_Stein> even better for Ashley_
[08:33:18] <Ashley_> Thanks guys

[08:34:40] <Dave_Stein> Ashley_ I'm not that special
[08:35:20] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: what's the behance news from yesterday?
[08:35:40] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: Acquired by Adobe. Pretty much the most exciting thing to ever happen to me
[08:35:45] <DaveMethvin> Dave_Stein: you're  missing java
[08:35:50] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: honestly, I'm not sureâ€¦ DaveMethvin is the guy to ask about grunt on windows
[08:35:51] <DaveMethvin> just ran into that yesterday
[08:35:52] <mikesherov> there he is
[08:35:55] <Dave_Stein> god you pop out of nowhere Dave haha
[08:35:59] <DaveMethvin> my ears were burning
[08:36:09] <DaveMethvin> btw you can just --force through that one
[08:36:09] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: congrats!
[08:36:29] <DaveMethvin> hookers and booze for everyone, Dave_Stein is payin!
[08:36:36] <Dave_Stein> thank you. I'll probably be looking for the jquery mobile guys within adobe shortly to connect :D
[08:36:45] <Dave_Stein> mike if you get bored where you're at let me know ;)
[08:37:57] <Dave_Stein> DaveMethvin: Eh getting Java now... just new pc so should have it anywho I suppose
[08:39:51] <Ashley_> I've tweeted fnagel, because it's christmas, and this is my screen session running at work, i'll probably forget to file a bug report when access is granted.
[08:39:57] <Ashley_> Cheers for your help chaps.
[08:41:22] <Dave_Stein> DaveMethvin: ha this error message is def out of date about PhantomJS, it says to go to a faq file that no longer exists womp wah
[08:45:09] <Dave_Stein> apparently npm install phantomjs isn't good enough for grunt

[10:16:57] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: what is best place, if any, to read about the testhelpers? hoping not source code :P TestHelpers.draggable.testDrag(el, el, 24, 24, 0, 0);
[10:17:11] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: yeh
[10:17:20] <mikesherov> in the source
[10:17:26] <Dave_Stein> porqueeeee
[10:17:27] <mikesherov> you should see what it used to be like!
[10:17:27] <Dave_Stein> ha
[10:18:20] <Dave_Stein> so maybe i read grid the wrong way as to how it should behave
[10:18:27] <Dave_Stein> the second line is TestHelpers.draggable.testDrag(el, el, 26, 25, 50, 50);
[10:18:37] <Dave_Stein> so if i move just a couple pixels, it should snap to next grid point?
[10:18:45] <Dave_Stein> i read it as over halfway based on the prior code
[10:19:07] <Dave_Stein> so if my grid is every 50, don't snap to next grid point until 25px in
[10:19:25] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez ^
[10:20:23] <Dave_Stein> yeah maybe i'm just crazy cause there's nothing about halfway in the old code 
[10:23:30] <Dave_Stein> hmm if i use 1.9 it certainly looks like halfway when i drag around tho >.< 
[10:23:39] <Dave_Stein> guess i'll work on snap while I talk to myself
