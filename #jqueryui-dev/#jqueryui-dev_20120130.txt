[13:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_: Any idea why all of this pixel shifting was done to accordion? https://gist.github.com/5794cd285e0c9eb13aac
[13:11:23] <toddmparker_> scott_gonzalez: was that to deal with strokes?
[13:12:04] <toddmparker_> all those margins and - margins tell me we were shifting to either negate a border or make things stay put when you added a border
[13:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...seems to be related to getting the collapsed headers to have space between them
[13:12:18] <toddmparker_> love all the zoom: madness for IE
[13:13:12] <toddmparker_> sure we needed to deal with different border rules and margins depending whether it's on top/middle/bottom
[13:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> gah, what a pain
[13:14:21] <toddmparker_> looking more closely, i can't tell exactly what allt eh shift stuff is on content
[13:14:44] <toddmparker_> we usually do more of that kinda stuff with tabs to get things to seam up
[13:15:03] <toddmparker_> are these the normal styles or only during animations?
[13:15:35] <toddmparker_> just thrown off by that first comment
[13:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> normal
[13:15:49] <toddmparker_> look, if these look ok w/o the styles in IE don't sweat it
[13:15:57] <toddmparker_> accordions are less tweaky than tabs
[13:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> It seems to be trying to deal with the fact that we want 2px below each header/panel group
[13:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> If it's collapsed, the margin comes from the header, if it's open, the margin comes from the panel.
[13:16:38] <toddmparker_> this is the rule I really don't get: margin-top: -2px; position: relative; top: 1px;
[13:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> At least, that's what I'm seeing visually when I remove all of those rules
[13:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure what's up with that.
[13:17:07] <toddmparker_> that seems redundant
[13:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe just some left over shifting from an initial attempt.
[13:17:30] <toddmparker_> i'm sure if you asked scott, he wouldn't remember either
[13:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> Since headers have margin-top -1
[13:17:56] <toddmparker_> yeah, could be
[13:18:06] <toddmparker_> if it were me, i'd try to simplify that
[13:18:27] <toddmparker_> just never know what bug/edgecase got us here
[13:18:36] <toddmparker_> or if it's just a mistake
[13:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah :-/
[13:19:03] <toddmparker_> don't be too afraid to simplify
[13:19:10] <toddmparker_> just test like hell
[13:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to get the animations to not cause jumpiness
[13:19:27] <toddmparker_> always wonder just how much to comment on styles like that
[13:19:31] <toddmparker_> prolly a lot
[13:19:46] <toddmparker_> ah, the fun of animations
[13:19:53] <toddmparker_> i'm still in animation hell on mobile
[13:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we've been trying to get accordion animations to not jump for years...
[13:20:13] <toddmparker_> if front-end is black magic, animations are a whole nother level of freakiness
[13:20:22] <toddmparker_> i remember working on that, yep
[13:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> I can get it to work if I remove all this shifting
[13:20:41] <toddmparker_> think it gets hitchy because it causes re-flow
[13:21:00] <toddmparker_> oh, well if that helps a lot, go for it
[13:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> You know what's sad? We don't even use the ui-accordion-header-active class in the code.
[13:21:26] <toddmparker_> you just don't want the accordion's dimensions (header height, etc.) to look different when open/close
[13:21:31] <toddmparker_> but otehrwise, reduce away
[13:21:39] <toddmparker_> really?
[13:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[13:21:50] <toddmparker_> gah
[13:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> That would explain why header-active removes the bottom border and content has top: 1px
[13:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> It should really be one or the other.
[13:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> But since the class is never applied, it was implemented twice :-
[13:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to fix it so the class gets added
[13:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_: got it :-) https://gist.github.com/27e5ac076bf55d2f1d01
[13:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> Only tested in Chrome so far, but this seems pretty straight-forward
[13:31:56] <toddmparker_> much better
[13:32:00] <toddmparker_> (if it works)
[13:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> hah, I just noticed that header-active uses !important
[13:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> Scott was probably like "why the hell don't my rules work?!?"
[14:38:48] <johnbender> hey guys, jenkins is on the rampage again
[14:38:53] <johnbender> any objections to a restart?
[14:39:34] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: rworth: jzaefferer:^
[14:46:09] <johnbender> it would be cool to get some monitoring set up with nagios or similar when the infra stuff happens
[16:30:18] <clarkbox> johnbender
[16:30:26] <clarkbox> did you restart? or do you need me too?
[16:30:47] <clarkbox> there is an initiative to get a nagios-like solution in place
