[06:41:34] <jzaefferer> Publishing 1.11.4 with "main": "ui/widget.js"` in package.json seems fine to me. Without that webpack, at least the version I tested, wouldn't work: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-ui-webpack-demo
[06:42:16] <jzaefferer> mikesherov_: if you've used 1.11.4 without this main entry in package.json, maybe we don't need it for 1.12 either. Could you check me demo and see if I was doing something wrong? https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-ui-webpack-demo
[10:34:53] <mikesherov_> we don't need main if I'm not doing `require('jqueryui');`
