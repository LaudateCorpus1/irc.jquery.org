[08:47:48] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I see the agenda says interactions still needs review. Can I also assume someone needs to do multitouch stuff still? If so I'll try and get back to it this week. Other than that I don't think I'm needed in meeting 
[08:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Yes, someone still needs to investigate multi-touch.
[08:51:28] <scott_gonzalez> It'll need to happen in a branch or a fork.
[08:52:55] <Dave_Stein> yup ypu i have a branch sitting somehwere
[08:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: There are also lots of test failures for draggable in the interactions branch.
[08:53:10] <Dave_Stein> okay when i get back to it ill fix the tests and then do that
[08:53:15] <Dave_Stein> i know that mike updated the branches
[08:53:18] <Dave_Stein> and got rid of the master_tests thing
[08:53:25] <Dave_Stein> so ill be able to fix all that i think fairly easily as it has been

[09:59:21] <mikesherov> so last thing
[09:59:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: 
[09:59:29] <mikesherov> test failures
[10:01:02] <mikesherov> it's only datepicker and dialog now
[10:01:12] <mikesherov> It would be super awesome to get a passing build
[10:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> If we could get TestSwarm to work properly.
[10:01:25] <mikesherov> I can't really figure out the dialog stuff
[10:01:37] <mikesherov> I can fix focus timing stuff
[10:01:40] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: BrowserStack cut us off
[10:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:01:50] <Krinkle>  "Error: You have run out of API time"
[10:01:54] <mikesherov> so‚Ä¶ sauceloabs?
[10:01:56] <Krinkle> I'm emailing now
[10:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'll try to fix the tests.
[10:01:57] <mikesherov> saucelabs?
[10:02:03] <Krinkle> mikesherov: On the horizon
[10:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack will give us more time.
[10:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> Just need to ping them.
[10:02:13] <mikesherov> Yeah, a green jenkins would be nice
[10:07:48] <mikesherov> so that's all I had
[10:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack should be good now.
[10:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Turned out to be a bug on their end.
[10:11:28] <mikesherov> well that's good to know
