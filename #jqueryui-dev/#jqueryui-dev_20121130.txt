[04:23:51] <jzaefferer> down to 14 dialog bugs for 1.10
[04:25:27] <mikesherov> nice, seemed like a few no longer apply now too
[04:26:29] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7496 isn't this the same bug that kborchers fixed a few days ago?
[04:27:42] <jzaefferer> that was about closing the dialog, which failed when it was positioned off-screen. Which can happen just by scrolling after opening the dialog.
[04:31:30] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: I can also no longer reproduce this. If someone can get a test case going on jsfiddle or JSBin or provide a clear set of reproduction steps, we'll go after it. Just reply to this ticket. For now, let's close as worksforme.

[13:13:03] <ewaibel> hello, looking for help with the jQuery UI Accordion Widget, specifically with this problem: we are building a custom widget that uses the jQuery UI Accordion widget and I need to add/remove panels and then refresh the accordion container so that the new/remaining panels resize correctly
[13:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> ewaibel: Use #jquery for support.
[13:17:39] <ewaibel> but it's for the jQuery UI Accordion Widget
[13:18:01] <kborchers> ?topic @ ewaibel 
[13:18:01] <bot-t> ewaibel, Topic: jQuery UI development (support at #jquery, core dev at #jquery-dev) Overview: http://wi
[13:18:42] <ewaibel> ok thanks
[13:47:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers gnarf mikesherov petro toddmparker _zoggy_: Thoughts? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7773#comment:5
[13:50:26] <petro> is there a big need to have multi-line dialog titlebars?
[13:51:28] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so what's your view on the http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/JQMtry.html? Is it a no go because this would only be applicable to widget?
[13:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> petro: Not that I know of.
[13:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's just a side effect of people allowing dialogs to be narrower than they should be.
[13:54:16] <agcolom> (I won't be offended ;-) I'd like to find a solution to the mobile problem which is that the long description prevents the quicknav to be in view...
[13:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'd like it be consistent across all types.
[13:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> Whether they're all in a box or all not in a box, as long as it's consistent.
[13:54:42] <agcolom> ok, yes, that'd be good
[13:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not attached to anything. I'm just working off designs I'm given.
[13:55:02] <agcolom> ok. That's an agreed point then ;-)
[13:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, if it works out better, we can even get rid of the boxes around options/methods/events.
[13:56:01] <agcolom> yes, I don't really mind either... Like you, I like consistency.
[13:57:16] <agcolom> wish we'd reached this point before the summit!!!!!!  then it would have be easier to resolve...
[13:57:30] <petro> scott_gonzalez: does the probably only occur when resized?
[13:57:38] <petro> *probably = problem
[14:02:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, the only reason it currently won't work outisde of widgets is because there is another box in the other elements... when you look at it (http://api.jqueryui.com/addClass/), the outer box and the inner box have a high level of repetition. Is that really needed or can that be reduced to one box heading and then we can have the description box?)
[14:03:42] <agcolom> this is currently not consistent with the widget section...
[14:04:17] <scott_gonzalez> petro: The problem does, but you can end up with a multi-line title without resizing if you have a long title.
[14:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's because the dialog contains the titlebar, content, and button pane.
[14:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> And we size the dialog wrapper + the content.
[14:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> So when it resizes and the titlebar gets larger, the button pane gets pushed down because the content pane is taller than it should be for the wrapper's height.
[14:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> Because resizing adjusts the wrapper and the content panel at the same time.
[14:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.
[14:10:09] <agcolom> me too... have a good weekend...
[14:10:46] <petro> scott_gonzalez: right now, the options I see are:
[14:10:46] <petro> a. limit the height of the title and ellipsis the rest like you mention in the ticket
[14:10:46] <petro> b. recalculate the heights on resize (yuck)
[14:10:46] <petro> c. use some box-sizing: border-box trickery on the content area (no IE<8 support without polyfill though)
[14:10:46] <petro> d. absolutely position the title/button panel (which comes with its own slew of challenges/regressions)
[14:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, limiting the height seems the best.
[14:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of any examples of dialogs with multi-line titles off the top of my head.
[14:12:36] <petro> ditto, seems like an edge case
[14:12:44] <petro> let's solve for the 98% usage :)
[14:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll wait till tomorrow (or maybe Monday) to see if anyone has any objections.
[14:25:51] <_zoggy_> found a new bug on that dialog
[14:26:42] <_zoggy_> resize the dialog larger than the di.ui-dialog and while the dialog panel says within that div limits the button pane does not
[14:28:20] <_zoggy_> and found yet another bug
[14:28:37] <_zoggy_> move modal to the top left, then resize dialog to be 100% width and height.. button pane disappears
[14:29:02] <_zoggy_> the dialog with multi-line as it is works fine fore me
[14:29:11] <_zoggy_> just the button pane and dialog resizing is wanky 
[14:29:53] <_zoggy_> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#default
[14:30:08] <_zoggy_> has less issues, but still has the resize issue wehre you are resizing the content pane rather than the window
[14:30:37] <_zoggy_> move the dialog to the upper left, then resize it to be 100% but then keep the mouse held down and keep going right/down and you see
[14:30:46] <_zoggy_> the content then goes behind the window and gets cut off as it resizes
[14:31:29] <_zoggy_> <div id="dialog" class="ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content" style="width: 800px; min-height: 105px; height: 644px;" scrolltop="0" scrollleft="0">
[14:31:30] <_zoggy_> 	<p>This is the default dialog which is useful for displaying information. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon.</p>
[14:31:30] <_zoggy_> </div>
[14:31:48] <_zoggy_> notice the width/height for the actual dialog is being resized greater than its container
[15:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: That's a resizable bug, which is already filed.
[15:28:59] <_zoggy_> ok
[20:26:30] <_zoggy_> http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/17.0.1/releasenotes/ -- osx 10.5 is no longer supported
