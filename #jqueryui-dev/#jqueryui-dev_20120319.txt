[06:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ^^
[06:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> The "older templates" section of http://view.jqueryui.com/datepicker/datepicker-rewrite/index.html is busted when you click on a date.
[06:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if that's new or old.
[06:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> But popup is working.

[06:59:50] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: they were broken before
[07:00:06] <jzaefferer> even since we landed Hans' update there
[07:00:26] <jzaefferer> speaking of Hans, he's working on the accordion ARIA todos - the stuff I added to the wiki is based on his comments
[07:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[07:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack says we're pounding their servers.
[07:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> They say "...there is something wrong with code using API as it is continuously blocking browsers where no tests maybe running at all. Its not at rest even for a single moment."
[07:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Have you tested the updated adm-zip?
[07:18:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: not yet
[07:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, the build is pretty much done, right?
[07:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> And it's working even without that, just not cross-OS.
[07:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to adding this in 1.9? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8200
[07:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we've got a standard for defining transitions thanks to accordion.
[07:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> I even listed autocomplete open and close in http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3772
[07:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose the menu could actually use show/hide though, not just transition.
[07:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, being able to explode the menu on close is pretty important :-)
[07:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, jzaefferer, rworth: Random jsbin that I don't have the URL for is the new random file on my computer :-(
[07:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> I showed how to use custom animations using just the existing events a long time ago.

[15:09:13] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grunt] Build/grunt: Update to latest grunt API, using reigsterMultiTask instead of registerBasicTask - Jörn Zaefferer
[15:09:13] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grunt] Build/grunt: Add a clean task. Good enough for now, but not really a good implementation - Jörn Zaefferer
[15:09:14] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grunt] Build/grunt: Another attempt at using adm-zip. Keep the result in place, but don't (yet) use it - need to report issues to adm-zip - Jörn Zaefferer
[15:11:48] <miznitic> using sortable, how does one get the position of a dropped element?
