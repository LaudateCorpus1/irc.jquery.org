[06:35:35] <jzaefferer> kborchers around?
[06:36:04] <kborchers> kind of. what's up?
[06:36:37] <jzaefferer> trying to get an idea of the state of new 1.9 widgets
[06:36:42] <jzaefferer> namely menu, menubar and popup
[06:37:05] <jzaefferer> landing more widgets would only delay 1.9 even further, so no point in trying to land those in master for 1.9
[06:37:46] <jzaefferer> looking at the wiki page TODOs, I'm not sure which are still valid
[06:37:57] <kborchers> i think menu is in a pretty good place right now. just need to write a bunch of unit tests
[06:38:01] <kborchers> the wiki is out of date
[06:38:10] <kborchers> todos 1 and 2 are no longer valid
[06:38:15] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[06:38:21] <kborchers> i will update it
[06:38:59] <kborchers> i did not make focus first item an option, i just tried to make it a little smarter and it works for selectmenu
[06:39:19] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:39:27] <kborchers> i think it may have messed with menubar a little though so i'll have to look at that
[06:39:52] <jzaefferer> as for menubar and popup: there wasn't a milestone release yet for those, and both seem very much incomplete, no where near where we want them
[06:40:30] <kborchers> yeah, i had planned on working on those last week and then i got really sick so haven't done much of anything recently
[06:40:53] <jzaefferer> at least the purpose of menubar is pretty clear, not so much for popup - having popup do anything on its own seems to be more of a bad idea, instead of should probably be a utility widget only, being used by others, like menu, datepicker, maybe menubar
[06:41:18] <jzaefferer> what would you think of ripping those two out of master, putting them in a branch and on hold for a later release?
[06:41:39] <kborchers> hmmm
[06:41:57] <kborchers> i think people really want menubar and it would make sense for it to come along with menu
[06:42:32] <jzaefferer> sure, but people also want 1.9
[06:42:37] <kborchers> but, there is a lot of work
[06:42:46] <kborchers> yeah
[06:42:55] <jzaefferer> at this point anything that delays 1.9 must be pushed aside...
[06:43:09] <kborchers> i can agree with that
[06:43:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what do you think about put menubar and popup into a branch?
[06:45:22] <kborchers> would that hurt felix? is he using popup for selectmenu?
[06:45:42] <jzaefferer> lemme check
[06:46:16] <jzaefferer> nope, all custom
[06:46:24] <jzaefferer> * Depends:
[06:46:24] <jzaefferer>  *	jquery.ui.core.js
[06:46:24] <jzaefferer>  *	jquery.ui.widget.js
[06:46:24] <jzaefferer>  *	jquery.ui.position.js
[06:46:24] <jzaefferer>  *	jquery.ui.menu.js
[06:46:24] <jzaefferer>  *	jquery.ui.button.js
[06:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> +1 on moving popup to a branch
[06:46:34] <kborchers> ok
[06:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> +0 on moving menubar, I don't really have enough context
[06:48:15] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: take a peek at the TODOs for menubar: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[06:48:32] <jzaefferer> "Add option orientation: vertical|horizontal" alone could be a pretty big change
[06:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> +1 on moving it :-P
[06:49:07] <jzaefferer> even ignoring the ARIA implications of that ;)
[06:50:28] <jzaefferer> I think only datepicker would be affected by moving popup
[06:50:35] <jzaefferer> that is, the datepicker branch
[06:50:55] <jzaefferer> well, probably also grid
[06:51:26] <jzaefferer> though both are basically on hold until 1.9 is done, right?
[07:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, pretty much
[07:14:23] <jzaefferer> so how could we do this? create a branch from master, then delete popup and menubar in master? then when merging master into that branch, skip the delete commit?
[07:16:25] <kborchers> jzaefferer: sounds about right
[07:16:29] <kborchers> i can't think of a better way
[07:16:46] <kborchers> though that is going to be a pain to remember when merging master in
[07:17:37] <jzaefferer> should be possible to merge master in once, with the right strategy...
[07:17:42] <jzaefferer> I'll try that locally
[07:18:30] <gnarf> actually
[07:18:47] <gnarf> it would probably be better to delete the shit
[07:18:47] <kborchers> what if we just pulled copies of the js/css/tests/demos for menubar and popup, deleted, then branched then incorporated those files back into the branch? or is that silly?
[07:18:49] <gnarf> then branch
[07:18:57] <gnarf> then revert the delete commit on the branch
[07:19:06] <gnarf> that will add a new commit that undoes the delete
[07:19:22] <kborchers> i think i like that better gnarf
[07:19:59] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ^^^
[07:22:20] <jzaefferer> delete, branch, revert delete commit
[07:22:23] <jzaefferer> makes sense
[07:23:11] <jzaefferer> single branch for both?
[07:24:29] <jzaefferer> there's also a few lines of popup-specific code in menu, would remove that, too
[07:24:52] <jzaefferer> that trigger option never made it to the spec anyway
[07:25:24] <kborchers> i can remove that
[07:25:57] <jzaefferer> should be part of the delete commit
[07:26:09] <kborchers> good point
[07:26:28] <jzaefferer> one menubar, one popup branch?
[07:26:46] <jzaefferer> we still want to try to use popup in menubar, so that would be a good reason to put them in one branch
[07:26:55] <kborchers> i was just typing that
[07:27:08] <jzaefferer> menubar-popup-mega-branch
[07:27:20] <kborchers> sounds good to me :P
[07:27:37] <jzaefferer> menuup-popbar
[07:28:25] <kborchers> menubar-with-popup-because-it-made-sense-to-combine-them-though-they-should-probably-be-separate
[07:29:03] <jzaefferer> let's just call it menubar? that's what people are more likely to be looking for
[07:29:38] <kborchers> yeah
[07:31:43] <jzaefferer> kborchers, one more: demos/menu/contextmenu.html makes use of that trigger option
[07:31:52] <jzaefferer> at some point, that had custom popup code
[07:31:57] <jzaefferer> revert or delete?
[07:32:28] <jzaefferer> at least neither menubar nor popup have any visual or unit tests...
[07:33:28] <kborchers> i would say delete that since it doesn't really act as a context menu anyway (right-click still opens browsers context menu)
[07:33:48] <jzaefferer> k
[07:35:01] <jzaefferer> demos/tooltip/video-player.html has some menus+popup
[07:36:10] <kborchers> ouch ... that's a nice demo too
[07:36:29] <jzaefferer> could just drop the menu...
[07:37:18] <kborchers> still have an issue with popup though right? aren't those popups when you click "Like" or is that just custom?
[07:38:09] <jzaefferer> nah, that's custom
[07:38:21] <kborchers> oh, ok
[07:39:30] <jzaefferer> lemme push that delete to a branch for you to double-check
[07:39:39] <kborchers> k
[07:39:41] <jzaefferer> if its okay, we'll merge to master and revert the commit on the branch
[07:39:56] <jzaefferer> git-dance(1)
[07:41:17] <jzaefferer> here we go
[07:41:21] <jzaefferer> commit bot?
[07:41:28] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer created menubar (+1 new commit): http://git.io/BSpd2Q

[07:41:51] <jzaefferer> ah, forgot some menubar stuff
[07:42:50] <jzaefferer> updating that
[07:42:59] <jzaefferer> kborchers: take a look now
[07:43:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer force-pushed menubar from eb35cb7 to 85348ee: http://git.io/IILy5w
[07:43:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/menubar] Menubar/Popup: Remove both to streamline the 1.9 release. Will revert this delete on the menubar branch, while development on master can continue without them. - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:43:06] <kborchers> ok
[07:43:09] <jzaefferer> now trace of menubar and only unrelated popup, as far as I can tell
[07:48:20] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i agree. i see no instances of menubar and only unrelated instances of the phrase popup
[07:52:56] <gnarf> is there a nice screenshot auto-upload tool for windows?
[07:52:59] <jzaefferer> alright, pushing to master
[07:53:08] <jzaefferer> gnarf: ala gyazo?
[07:53:47] <gnarf> yeah
[07:53:53] <gnarf> or that cloud app one i use
[07:54:27] <jzaefferer> I've got a 32bit binary of gyazo that reads from a ini file
[07:54:37] <jzaefferer> but doesn't work on 64bit windows 7 as far as I can tell
[07:55:27] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to menubar: http://git.io/BsqABA
[07:55:27] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/menubar] Add back Menubar and Popup. Until they can once more land in master. - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:55:30] <gnarf> a buddy was on windows
[07:55:39] <gnarf> and trying to share a screenshot w/ me over aim
[07:55:40] <jzaefferer> "a buddy"? :-)
[07:55:46] <jzaefferer> ha, okay
[07:55:47] <gnarf> and file transfers are being strange
[07:55:51] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[07:56:03] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #188: STILL FAILING in 2 min 54 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/188/
[07:56:03] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Menubar/Popup: Remove both to streamline the 1.9 release. Will revert this delete on the menubar branch, while development on master can continue without them.
[07:56:03] <gnarf> but yeah - gyazo
[07:56:04] <gnarf> thanks
[07:56:05] <gnarf> :)
[07:56:21] <jzaefferer> but windows is he using?
[07:56:25] <kborchers> gnarf: i can also vouch for gyazo on windows
[07:56:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the download site says win7 is supported
[07:56:38] <gnarf> so
[07:56:49] <jzaefferer> right, but they don't support a custom server
[07:56:58] <jzaefferer> but you probably don't care about that
[07:56:59] <jzaefferer> so nevermind
[07:57:02] <gnarf> unimportant right now
[07:57:07] <kborchers> i am running on win7
[07:57:35] <kborchers> http://gyazo.com/20defe69bc8782240f03729132693965
[07:57:40] <jzaefferer> so, menubar and popup are gone from master
[07:57:45] <kborchers> cool
[07:59:08] <jzaefferer> still leaves as with menu, tooltip and spinner as new 1.9 widgets
[08:00:09] <jzaefferer> kborchers: you'll work on full coverage for menu unit tests?
[08:00:39] <kborchers> that is my plan ... just trying to fit it in with client work deadlines
[08:01:13] <kborchers> r we trying to get 1.9 out this month?
[08:02:22] <jzaefferer> not really
[08:02:42] <jzaefferer> by the SF conf is a goal
[08:04:37] <kborchers> oh, ok. another milestone this month though right?
[08:04:50] <kborchers> sf conf is april right?
[08:04:53] <gnarf> i really wish we would takte the time to get some code coverage analysis setup for our units too
[08:05:57] <jzaefferer> kborchers: probably april, yeah, don't have an actual date yet
[08:07:02] <kborchers> ok, i was just going by last year. gotta figure out a way to pay for this one myself :(
[08:11:08] <jzaefferer> become a speaker!
[08:15:31] <kborchers> yeah, been trying to think of a topic recently
[08:25:49] <jzaefferer> gnarf: regarding code coverage, I've tested jscoverage once
[08:26:12] <jzaefferer> I can remember that there were some efforts in nodejs land to create new coverage tools, but I've got no idea where those went
[08:26:39] <jzaefferer> running jscoverage once, locally, isn't a big deal, but getting that into CI would be quite the effort
[08:26:49] <gnarf> it would be pretty useful to see what sort of coverage we get
[08:27:35] <gnarf> might be useful to see if there is some way we could get it integrated into swarm
[08:29:32] <jzaefferer> yeah, jscoverage is probably a bad choice for that
[08:38:42] <jzaefferer> gnarf: this was that node project, kinda dead though: https://github.com/pquerna/node-blanket/issues/2
[08:38:43] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on node-blanket, reported by jzaefferer (6m, 3w ago): Add some docs
[09:28:14] <chrisvwebdev> happy new year
[09:28:20] <chrisvwebdev> anyone available?
[09:28:45] <jzaefferer> chrisvwebdev: don't ask to ask :-)
[09:29:35] <chrisvwebdev> ha! understood....i was hoping to get some information on the development of jqueryui-menu
[09:29:54] <jzaefferer> you're in the right place for that
[09:29:56] <jzaefferer> what specifically?
[09:29:57] <chrisvwebdev> and see if there is anything i can do to assist.
[09:30:22] <chrisvwebdev> well, i would like to use it for a small project, and i've run into a roadblock.
[09:30:32] <jzaefferer> kborchers is working on Menu these days
[09:31:05] * kborchers appears
[09:31:07] <chrisvwebdev> i wanted to see if there was a consensus on how to handle a particular case with menu navigation.
[09:31:08] <kborchers> ohai
[09:31:34] <chrisvwebdev> hi kborchers! i feel like i know you after delving into your work : )
[09:31:52] <kborchers> so you must hate me ;)
[09:32:06] <chrisvwebdev> i needed your help...just your opinion on how a navigation use case should be handled with Menu
[09:32:12] <chrisvwebdev> ha! far from it : )
[09:32:37] <chrisvwebdev> your Menu has helped me get pretty far along with a small project I was coding
[09:32:46] <chrisvwebdev> so no worries.  anything helps.
[09:33:01] <kborchers> cool, so what is the nav use case?
[09:33:19] <chrisvwebdev> so, if you have a couple of minutes, i'd like to pick your brain about the navigation
[09:33:57] <kborchers> i can do my best. i am at work right now so may get pulled away at times
[09:34:10] <chrisvwebdev> my markup has three nested unordered lists:  region->midregion->subregion.  i've managed to make that data hierarchy work with your Menu code
[09:34:19] <jzaefferer> chrisvwebdev: kborchers isn't the only one to blame, just the one working on Menu more recently. scott_gonzalez and me also played our part
[09:34:22] <chrisvwebdev> sure, no worries.  any bit of assistance will help
[09:34:39] <chrisvwebdev> thanks for the info jzaefferer
[09:35:16] <jzaefferer> if you're wondering where menubar and popup went, we just moved that from master into a separate branch today
[09:35:25] <chrisvwebdev> in the navigation, each unordered list has a checkbox input.  so you can select the region for your input, or a child subregion of that region, and so on
[09:36:22] <chrisvwebdev> my issue is this:  when a user is in a "mid region" and they have the option to navigate up to the parent region or delve deeper into the child subregion,
[09:37:08] <chrisvwebdev> how would you go about creating visual cues to let the user know he/she can click on the midregion to select it, or to use the arrow keys to go back up to region
[09:37:17] <chrisvwebdev> or down into subregions?
[09:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like a tree, not a menu
[09:37:56] <kborchers> i was just thinking that
[09:38:31] <chrisvwebdev> it seems like then an unordered list has parent and child unordered lists, how can i make it clear that there is an option to click on the current list item for selection.
[09:38:44] <chrisvwebdev> and yes, you guys are right.  this is pretty much a tree
[09:39:17] <chrisvwebdev> would Menu not be the correct way to implement my multi-nested checkbox menu?
[09:39:23] <chrisvwebdev> please advise
[09:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to investigate the accessibility of such a menu.
[09:40:27] <kborchers> i would probably recommend at least looking into something like jsTree to see if that would work better for you
[09:42:14] <chrisvwebdev> yes, i'm reading about jstree right now
[09:43:04] <chrisvwebdev> thanks for the suggestions so far.  so i take it that menu is not the right tool for this?
[09:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that menus should work this way, even though I made this example: http://scottgonzalez.github.com/jquery-examples/autocomplete/similar-results.html
[09:43:35] <kborchers> do you have a demo of what you got working so far. maybe that will help me make any other recommendations
[09:45:30] <chrisvwebdev> @scott, that's pretty much what i was thinking....letting a user populate an text input using the slick menu plugin.  i was in the process of working out the checkbox selects to
[09:45:50] <chrisvwebdev> signify the user's intent to place that value in the input field.
[09:46:19] <chrisvwebdev> @kborchers:  your help is appreciated very much. i can get my demo to you
[09:46:54] <chrisvwebdev> after i have a full working example. i would love to have you review my sample if you have time at some point.
[09:48:32] <chrisvwebdev> @scott_gonzalez:  yes, your demo is the reason i'm here asking for philosophical/practical guidance on how to handle a certain case.  i wasn't sure if Menu was supposed to be used the way you have made it work.
[09:49:06] <chrisvwebdev> however, with the input options in kborchers demos, i figured i could use it to let user's select values for a single field
[09:49:46] <kborchers> chrisvwebdev: r u referring to my inputmenu stuff in my repo?
[09:51:14] <chrisvwebdev> yes, that's correct kborchers
[09:52:22] <kborchers> ohhh, ok. i have not been keeping that up to date. i would not recommend using that in its current form. it is well behind the menu in jquery-ui
[09:53:01] <kborchers> and there were definite issues with it. specifically with the text inputs in the menu. checkboxes and radios were working pretty well though
[09:54:02] <chrisvwebdev> yes, that's what i discovered.  the checkboxes and radios seemed to work perfectly.  so, i wanted to use it for a tree-like checkbox select menu
[09:54:05] <kborchers> looking at it now though, checkboxes even seem buggy now :(
[09:54:26] <chrisvwebdev> ehhh.  maybe i can offer to help? : )
[09:55:13] <chrisvwebdev> but yes, i wanted to use that as a prototype that allows a user to select value options and define a text input field with the selected value
[09:55:17] <kborchers> feel free to fork it :)
[09:55:56] <chrisvwebdev> sure, i can do that.  how far did you get in testing? did the checboxes/radio buttons work in all browsers?
[09:56:43] <chrisvwebdev> i was trying to come up with an intuitive way to let a user now they could select a menu li element or navigation down whenever that case presented itself.
[09:57:51] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure on browser support but it probably worked in all browsers at one point.
[09:58:09] <kborchers> i honestly never had a test where a checkbox item had a sub-menu
[09:58:25] <kborchers> doesn't seem like a very intuitive menu
[09:58:58] <kborchers> and scott's concerns with accessibility should be considered
[09:59:07] <chrisvwebdev> sure, all good points
[09:59:36] <kborchers> not sure how you would present that to someone who can't see to tell them this is a checkbox but it has menus below. seems confusing
[09:59:51] <chrisvwebdev> yes, that is exactly my problem.
[10:00:14] <chrisvwebdev> that would seem very confusing, however our marketing department would like so see if that was possible
[10:00:34] <chrisvwebdev> i recommened against it, however, they just wanted to see a prototype of some sort
[10:00:57] <kborchers> so coming full circle ... i would probably urge you to look into tree implementations and work from there as that seems like a better fit in my opinion
[10:01:58] <chrisvwebdev> ok. i think you are correct.  and i think they wanted to make things less tree-like
[10:02:14] <chrisvwebdev> so i'm trying to appease them as much as possible
[10:03:36] <kborchers> well, if you must please them, feel free to modify my inputmenu extension to your needs. i would warn you though that these changes would probably not make it into the official supported Menu widget
[10:06:38] <chrisvwebdev> sure, that sounds reasoable.
[10:06:49] <chrisvwebdev> i think i will work the jsTree plugin you recommended
[10:07:09] <chrisvwebdev> then work back to the input menu if that isn't a viable option.
[10:07:25] <chrisvwebdev> i think i can work in jsTree to make it look the way they want it to look.
[10:07:34] <chrisvwebdev> your help and time is much appreciated
[10:07:54] <kborchers> no problem. if you do come back to menu, feel free to ping me with questions
[10:08:26] <chrisvwebdev> sure. is this the best place, or do you recommend email or another communication?
[10:09:59] <kborchers> here or #jquery are fine. if i'm not around, have bot-t1 (bot-t) tell me
[10:10:07] <kborchers> ?tell chrisvwebdev like this
[10:10:07] <bot-t1> kborchers, Okay.
[10:12:24] <chrisvwebdev> ha! no problem.  yes, i spend a lot of time with jquery, and it's pretty much all i use--along with raw javascript of course.
[10:12:25] <bot-t1> (2 mins 18 secs ago) <kborchers> tell chrisvwebdev like this
[10:12:53] <chrisvwebdev> i spend lots of time on the official jquery forums giving free support to give back as much as possible
[10:13:40] <chrisvwebdev> so i like this community.  everyone seems friendly and willing to help
[10:13:50] <chrisvwebdev> i'll let you know how things turn out
[10:13:51] <chrisvwebdev> thx
[10:14:00] <kborchers> ?hi5 @ chrisvwebdev
[10:14:00] <bot-t1> chrisvwebdev, ⋰⁵⋱
[19:43:52] <Tulenian> Does anyone happen to know when 1.8.17 will be officially released?
[22:39:48] <gnarf> Tulenian: it already has been - we are still waiting on the CDN's to pick it up before we announce
[22:40:10] <gnarf> so hopefully very very soon
