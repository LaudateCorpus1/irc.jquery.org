[05:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> heh, what a great typo: http://cl.ly/image/0A2X081G3b2P
[05:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> He's at the UK conf.
[05:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: ping
[06:08:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hey! please just let me know if my comments are not clear.
[06:09:01] <rxaviers> I just answered what I said I would in the conversation;
[06:20:01] <jzaefferer> it seemed pretty clear in our last Skype call that we're talking about moving things from UI to DB
[06:20:07] <jzaefferer> not to a third component
[06:21:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: ^
[06:21:48] <rxaviers> clear to me too
[06:22:04] <rxaviers> my first comment (of the two) is all about moving things into DB
[06:23:40] <jzaefferer> "In other words, what is needed to make DB loosely coupled from jQueryUI (absent of build tools)"
[06:23:48] <jzaefferer> I don't think I understand what this is about
[06:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> That's about not having tons of conditionals inside db.
[06:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-ui needs to expose more data about how to generate the build.
[06:24:47] <rxaviers> correct
[06:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> Because that data changes over time.
[06:26:20] <rxaviers> my second comment (of the two) is about a comparison if we would move it to UI instead (by my point of view of course).. I am in doubt if Im being pretentious or induced my my thoughts. I need you guys to correct me. But, it seems so good if we would do that instead. Maybe I am not seen the prejudices, and the decision is up to you.
[06:26:56] <rxaviers> just raising the pros/cons
[11:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Did you ever end up playing with web components?
[11:43:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: no, want to but been busy. i'd be willing to devote some time if you have a specific widget in mind to try out or want to chat about it. 
[11:43:53] <kborchers> been pretty focused on the pointer event thing when i have time
[11:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I'm trying to figure out why http://jsbin.com/uzoqix/1/edit doesn't work.
[11:44:01] <kborchers> would appreciate another review of that if you get time too
[11:45:05] <kborchers> hmmm
[11:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's so simple, I can't imagine what could be wrong.
[11:46:11] <kborchers> yeah, that's weird
[13:17:34] <tj_vantoll> Question: All events include the ui object as their second parameter.  If the object is empty it'll show in the docs as simply Type: Object.  For example: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-beforeClose
[13:17:34] <tj_vantoll> When the object is empty should we throw a sentence in there to indicate that?
[13:31:15] <tj_vantoll> My significant other is switching her company from Dojo to UI and I'm getting lots of "feedback" on the docs.  I'll create an issue.
[13:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: That's correct.
[13:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> We can add a sentence.
[13:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> It has caused confusion before.
[13:31:41] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Oh, feedback is good :-)
[13:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's amazing how few people file issues.
[13:32:14] <tj_vantoll> Where would this need to go?  https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L826
[13:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, are you trying to write this for all empty objects or just for widget events with an empty ui hash?
[13:34:01] <tj_vantoll> The 2nd would be preferred but I was just trying to think of a way to handle it on a more global level.
[13:34:37] <scott_gonzalez> Widget events are controlled by https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L919
[13:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> But they just go through the standard method signature template: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L946-L948
[13:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> I guess you could inspect the properties at that point and add a note if there are no properties for the ui object.
[13:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> But you're not going to be able to put it inline.
[13:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> It'd have to be before or after the entire signature.
[13:36:16] <tj_vantoll> Ok, yeah I was going the inline route so I see that now.
[13:37:04] <tj_vantoll> Inline would be preferable but I think it would help to have something after the signature.
[13:38:53] <tj_vantoll> beforeClose( event, ui )
[13:38:53] <tj_vantoll> <i>Note: The ui object is empty and provided for consistency with other events.</i>
[13:38:54] <tj_vantoll> Or something.  I'll see what I can come up with.
[13:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, a note after should be fine.
[13:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> It'll end up looking almost inline anyway.
[13:43:21] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.  How do you test the templates in grunt-jquery-content?
[13:47:02] <tj_vantoll> Anyways I have to head out for the day.  I'll at least create an issue for this later tonight.  I'd like to try to change grunt-jquery-content but I might need my hand held.
[19:31:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?

[20:06:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: FYI, from what i've seen, you need at least a little JS to add a shadow root and dump the template contents in â€¦ can't find any support for custom elements without a polyfill http://jsbin.com/uzoqix/17/edit
