[04:45:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:05:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[05:10:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:10:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Can I rename some of the classes for clearBtn?
[05:10:35] <gabriel_schulhof> They are useful more generically than just for the textinput clear button.
[05:10:48] <gabriel_schulhof> In particular, they're good for adding any kind of button, especially with a pre-rendered input.
[05:10:56] <arschmitz> hmmm
[05:11:11] <arschmitz> we need to stop messing with classes with out notice i think
[05:11:30] <arschmitz> even though we have done it a bunch messing with classes is essentially an api break
[05:11:37] <gabriel_schulhof> I agree that those classes are part of the public API.
[05:11:47] <gabriel_schulhof> So I'm thinking the usual process of deprecation, etc.
[05:12:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: how about you just make a class with new name apply it in all the same places and deprecate old class
[05:12:17] <gabriel_schulhof> Exactly what I was thinking.
[05:12:38] <arschmitz> ok i think that is fine
[05:12:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Basically, double up the rules involving the two classes ui-input-has-clear and ui-input-clear.
[05:13:01] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and modify clearButton to use the new classes.
[05:13:18] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and update the API docs with the deprecation.
[05:13:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome!
[05:13:51] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and add deprecation notices.
[05:13:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: have to apply both in widget i thnk
[05:14:01] <arschmitz> or else peoples selectors will break
[05:14:03] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ...
[05:14:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Good point.
[05:14:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[05:14:19] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:14:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Will do.
[05:15:23] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll make an issue about it.
[05:18:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Won't adding new rules just for the sake of deprecation slow down the CSS?

[05:19:11] <arschmitz> no i dont think so
[05:19:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Basically, I'm not sure: Does abc, def { property: value; } count as two rules, or one?
[05:19:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can you "for free" add more comma-separated selectors to a given set of style property changes?
[05:19:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: either way do you know a way to not break selectors otherwise
[05:20:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Nope :(
[05:20:17] <arschmitz> and i bet you can show me a page it makes a difference on in actual percieved speed either way
[05:20:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... I'm just wondering if the use case is important enough to warrant the change.
[05:20:22] <arschmitz> cant*
[05:20:33] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:20:36] <gabriel_schulhof> I accept.
[05:21:02] <arschmitz> i do agree im not sure how important it really is
[05:21:14] <arschmitz> but i cant see it making an actual real world perf difference either
[05:23:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I got the idea when trying to implement the link button for the web-ui-fw tokentextarea (http://web-ui-fw.github.io/jqm/latest/demos/widgets/tokentextarea/tokentextarea.html). I'm re-implenenting that widget to work with the 1.4 styling and I realized that I can do the link button using ui-input-clear
[05:24:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well is there another use IN the library?
[05:24:46] <gabriel_schulhof> http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/widgets/tokentextarea2/tokentextarea2.html
[05:24:51] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't think so.
[05:24:58] <arschmitz> because we generally dont add stuff unless we actually use it internally
[05:25:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, yeah. This /would/ be a new feature.
[05:25:39] <arschmitz> but its not a feature on its own
[05:25:55] <arschmitz> its just something you want for a 3rd party widget
[05:25:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The funny thing is, it's only a change in semantics.
[05:26:02] <arschmitz> for a better name
[05:26:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:26:22] <arschmitz> it kinda sounds like this might be something more for new theme
[05:26:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I can't help but think that it'd be useful. textinput + button is a fairly standard UI element.
[05:26:48] <gabriel_schulhof> We've already had people wanting to put a textinput in a controlgroup, and we've done that via a demo.
[05:26:59] <gabriel_schulhof> This is making a button appear to be inside the textinput.
[05:27:12] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and we've got that too, but the class names do not reflect its generic usefulness.
[05:27:31] <arschmitz> i get all that i just wonder if it should be part of new theme not current
[05:27:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. Might be the way to go.
[05:27:46] <arschmitz> where we will have a pure css framework that supports many things we dont do internally
[05:27:59] <arschmitz> and where classes ARE features
[05:28:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I certainly have no problem using the nomenclature-deficient names :)
[05:28:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:28:23] <arschmitz> im not saying this 100% or anything just pondering out loud
[05:28:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. I don't feel too strongly about it either.
[05:28:56] <gabriel_schulhof> As it stands, it would be a very small feature to add for 1.5.0.
[05:29:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Might not even be worth the effort.
[05:29:35] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but maybe I should still file the issue for the new theme.
[05:30:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, wow! New theme is 2.0.
[05:30:32] <gabriel_schulhof> We don't even have a 2.0 milestone.
[05:30:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes that is the thing that makes 2.0 for both is theme
[05:30:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Does the new theme have a repo? Maybe I should file an issue there.
[05:33:56] <gabriel_schulhof> jasperdegroot: ^
