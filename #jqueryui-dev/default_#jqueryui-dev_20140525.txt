[13:08:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:   Ping!
[13:12:56] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: seems like in order to "fix" #10056 we would have to do something like https://gist.github.com/petersendidit/4a4cb89654e88433eecd
[13:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: But we don't even call _off() from refresh().
[13:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking of something similar though.
[13:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll need to handle this for most widgets that have a meaning refresh() implementation.
[13:54:57] <petersendidit> we call off in tabs in setupEvents https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/tabs.js#L504
[13:55:39] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez which is only called in _refresh and when the event option changes
[14:02:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?

[14:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Ah! I missed that when I looked the other day.
[14:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we need to slice, we can just `foo = foo.not( bar )`
[14:38:05] <petersendidit> seems like handling it in _off is the correct place 
[14:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[14:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> I would suggest switching to delegation to avoid this, but I think that would just complicate the code.
[14:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Since tabs can be nested and there's no required structure for the markup.
[14:44:27] <petersendidit> we already do some delegation in tabs https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/tabs.js#L80-L95
[14:46:49] <petersendidit> seems like tabs 
[14:47:06] <petersendidit> has a lot of finds that depend on ul/ol > li
[14:47:53] <petersendidit> you could delegate on tabList rather than element 
[14:49:34] <petersendidit> but that means adding the ability to delegate with something other than element
