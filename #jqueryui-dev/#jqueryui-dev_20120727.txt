[01:58:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: O_o
[03:32:51] <shoky> buttonset() seems dead in 1.9b1.. known issue?
[03:41:21] <jzaefferer> shoky: worksforme: http://view.jqueryui.com/1.9.0-beta.1/demos/button/radio.html
[03:42:20] <shoky> hmm
[03:42:51] <shoky> doesntforme http://jsfiddle.net/L5T82/2/
[03:43:17] <shoky> if i switch to 1.7.2 there's no error but it still doesn't work
[03:50:02] <jzaefferer> shoky: the CSS include is bad, its not interpreted as a stylesheet due to lack of mimetype
[03:50:15] <jzaefferer> and yeah, beta1 doesn't work with jQuery edge, but that's fixed in master
[03:52:35] <shoky> which jquery should i be testing with? or should i just wait for next beta/rc?
[03:55:18] <jzaefferer> beta1 works with 1.7.2 and below
[03:56:23] <shoky> yeah just realized that. i was sure for some reason that combo doesn't work for me either. thanks for your time

[07:08:46] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Tabs tests: Removed workaround for Firefox <13 passing values to setTimeout().
[07:15:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you here?
[07:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:17:14] <mikesherov> Cool, I have a few guys doing a jqueryui bug squash today. I'm compiling a lit of tickets that we believe are fixed, but are still listed as open.
[07:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[07:18:00] <mikesherov> My guys are going to leave comments on those tixx, but I'll also send you a list at the end of the day.
[07:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. I'll try to keep up with them as they come in.
[07:18:34] <mikesherov> Are there any things in particular you'd like us to focus on?
[07:19:09] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8264 is the first one
[07:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing in particular. Datepicker is going to be rewritten from scratch, so I might hold off on that one.
[07:19:45] <mikesherov> OK, we were looking at sortable and effects
[07:20:21] <mikesherov> but if there are any datepicker things that pique the guys interests, I'll make sure that at least failing unit tests get produced to support the rewrite
[07:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know why these are shifting to the right? http://jsfiddle.net/mpetrovich/wk3pk/3/
[07:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: The API for datepicker might be completely different. I wouldn't spend time on tests for it.
[07:22:05] <mikesherov> K, understood
[07:22:58] <mikesherov> mpetrovich: Do you know why these are shifting to the right? http://jsfiddle.net/mpetrovich/wk3pk/3/
[07:26:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the "scale" effect in general assumes absoulte position
[07:26:43] <mpetrovich> @mikesherov: It's because the #icons container is being scaled, and it spans the full width
[07:27:57] <mpetrovich> @mikesherov: http://jsfiddle.net/mpetrovich/wk3pk/4/
[07:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, brand new MBP just crashed.
[07:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: So that fiddle looks "correct"?
[07:30:15] <scott_gonzalez> It does look better than the previous version.
[07:30:27] <gnarf> yeah
[07:42:50] <mpetrovich> @gnarf Is the "scale" effect only meant to be used on absolutely positioned elements?
[07:42:53] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8273 also appears to be working on edge. Couldn't repro with instructions given. Recommend closing.

[08:01:33] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Tabs tests: Removed workaround for Firefox <13 passing values to setTimeout().
[08:26:04] <gnarf> mpetrovich: not "only" but its all that its ever been any good for, behavior in other cases is awkward at best
[08:31:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #6: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/6/

[08:33:35] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7726 also works as expected on edge. Recommend closing as fixed.
[08:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> done
[09:33:24] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: quick question for you about slider events
[09:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:33:42] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: slidestart - does that use _trigger ?
[09:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, everything uses _trigger.
[09:34:17] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I thought that _trigger prefixed the event with the widget name?
[09:34:22] * johnbender could be completely mistaken
[09:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> It does, but the prefix is customizable.
[09:34:37] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: _ORLY_
[09:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.slider.js#L24
[09:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> And if the prefix matches the event name, the prefix isn't added.
[09:35:14] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: enlightenment
[09:35:16] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thanks
[09:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why there's a slide event not a slideslide or sliderslide.
[09:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> BUT
[09:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> This is going to change.
[09:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> The customizable prefix will be dropped.
[09:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> And the prefix will be widget name + colon
[09:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> so slider:start
[09:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> The code for that doesn't exist yet.
[09:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> But we've run into problems with native event name collisions.
[11:08:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: can you take a look at the last comment on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5601 , and let me know if you think it should stay open or get closed?
[11:09:24] <mikesherov> gnarf: you here?
[11:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yeah, I've never been too sure about that ticket.
[11:10:49] <mikesherov> Yeah, mpetrovich spent a bit looking into it. He thinks it's a bad example
[11:10:55] <mikesherov> maybe it's just needsdocs
[11:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, maybe we should just add overflow: auto to the tabs.
[11:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> To keep them self-contained.
[11:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> Rather than saying that everyone else will need to add that to their styles if they put tabs near a float.
[11:13:37] <mikesherov> yeah, but that may cause scrollbars
[11:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme + point at that last comment?
[11:15:47] <mikesherov> yeah
[11:16:49] <mikesherov> one sec, mpetrovich is testing
[11:17:02] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[11:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:19:34] <mpetrovich> overflow: auto on the .tabs container only adds a scroll bar if a descendant element is absolutely positioned
[11:20:00] <mpetrovich> scratch that, not even if it's absolute
[11:20:48] <mpetrovich> http://jsfiddle.net/MBShQ/46/
[11:21:36] <mpetrovich> overflow: auto will clip any absolutely positioned elements that go outside the bounds of the tabs :-\
[11:23:02] <mpetrovich> I don't think it'd be wise to impose overflow: auto; on everyone just because some use-cases need it.
[11:24:00] <mikesherov> sounds like worksforme + point at last comment then, scott_gonzalez
[11:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks mpetrovich and mikesherov. I'll close it now.
[11:29:48] <mikesherov> np
[11:33:14] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7890 this one is due to FF (and soon other browsers) not reporting "auto" from getComputedStyle, should we add an option for swipe direction in fold, or just close as cantfix
[11:55:26] <mikesherov> this is fixed in jQuery 1.8 scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3998
[12:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: For the fold effect, it'd be nice to eventually support specifying position, but for now I think we should just close as cantfix.
[12:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> That reaches across a LOT of stuff though.
[12:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> draggable, resizable, multiple effects, etc.
[12:57:15] <mikesherov> yeah
[12:57:37] <mikesherov> same with a lot of issues around margin auto too
[13:21:48] <mpetrovich> ^^ and text-align: center too
