[06:02:02] <Moshe> Hi, I'm having trouble with the patch for bug #5280 for jQuery UI, is someone here who was involved with it? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5280
[06:04:58] <Moshe> In firefox, rounding is not always the correct solution, it seems... I have problems with a margin: auto; layout and the rounding breaks a non-integer position firefox makes up
[06:33:21] <Moshe> see this example: http://moshe.nl/jqueryui-position-bug.html
[06:49:03] <Moshe> I have submitted a bug report: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7972
[07:02:43] <Moshe> hi imarklee
[07:09:31] <imarklee> hello
[13:18:56] <sennahoj> hey guys, small question. I am watching the jquery ui project for quite a while and mentioned last recently that the time intervals between single release increased. I didn't find any information about that, or any reasons...got the project stuck?
