[05:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> FJ1: This week or next.
[05:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> We're just working through the final details for our new infrastructure.
[05:10:34] <FJ1> very nice!
[05:42:48] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.7.x core build #75: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.7.x%20core/75/
[06:23:42] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, what would be good todos for themeroller in the summit. New features over the current themeroller?
[06:23:53] <rxaviers> There are some new features in the trac...
[06:28:00] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #52: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/52/
[06:28:51] <_zoggy_> you know how you save what themeroller settings you used when you build out the link to customize it again? be nice to have the equal for what components were selected as well
[06:29:26] <_zoggy_> for example, everytime i go to update one of my projects i have to use that link to get the theme we use.. but then go lookup what stuff we actually need to include (componet wise)
[06:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: No new features until we figure out what we're doing with the CSS framework.
[06:39:14] <rxaviers> ah! ok
[06:39:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what would be good tasks for themeroller in the summit?
[06:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that there's anything to do.
[06:40:49] <rxaviers> mm
[06:41:28] <rxaviers> thats interesting
[06:42:22] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Once 1.9.0 is out and people start using it, there's probably going to be a bunch of work for bug fixes
[06:43:16] <rxaviers> ;)
[06:43:34] <rxaviers> work ahead, ok
[06:47:34] <_zoggy_> any plans to allow the user to specify if they want to remove the ie6/7 hacks in the jui css
[06:54:07] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers, before you start getting bored, check out the Roadmap for new tasks: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[06:54:54] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: Menubar would be a good starting point for you, needs a proper spec, unit tests, better API for customizing button styles...
[06:55:27] <rxaviers> excellent!!
[06:57:02] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you could start by just reviewing whats there, make a list of tasks, see what doesn't work, looks bad or needs to be improved
[06:58:12] <rxaviers> ok
[07:03:30] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, when deselecting everything + selecting no theme disables download. Shall we replicate?
[07:03:46] <rxaviers> (I mean, shall rewrite behave the same way)
[07:05:07] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: yeah, makes sense
[07:05:23] <rxaviers> ;)

[09:45:36] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: don't branch (or push branches) when you instantly merge them anyway
[09:45:51] <jzaefferer> branches are nice for anything that takes a little while or needs a review (via PR)
[09:46:25] <jzaefferer> also I think you can delete the tooltip branch?
[09:46:26] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, makes sense. Well, I did it to see how my README change would be shown in github
[09:46:53] <jzaefferer> I just removed that forking branch
[09:47:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: that kind of makes sense. A local markdown preview would make that a lot faster
[09:47:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, about the tooltip, it was not yet landed
[09:48:05] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: if you're using sublime text: https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview
[09:48:05] <rxaviers> did you like the tooltip changes better?
[09:48:11] <jzaefferer> let me check it now
[09:48:23] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ah!! good to know
[09:48:42] <rxaviers> although, I use vim
[09:49:06] <rxaviers> well maybe I could simply paste it to a gist and take a look. I agree there are faster ways...
[09:49:13] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I'm sure you can find something that renders markdown in your browser locally ;)
[09:49:21] <rxaviers> agree ;)
[09:49:23] <jzaefferer> tooltips look good!
[09:49:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what do you think? http://bassistance.de/i/03c14e.png
[09:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[09:51:44] <rxaviers> ok landing then
[10:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: joining the call?
[10:03:31] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, using tooltip instead of dialogs there is a much better improvement. Although, I think showing tooltip on mouseover messes things up when another tooltip is already opened by focus of another input.
[10:04:07] <rxaviers> Does it bother you as it bothers me? Or is it just fine?
[10:05:32] <rxaviers> if it that shows up on focus only, it would feel better (in my opinion).
[10:06:06] <rxaviers> Although, it seems tooltip hardcodes the triggering events. I can't simply opt not to trigger on mouseover.
[10:06:08] <_zoggy_> just do tooltip on focus
[10:06:46] <_zoggy_> any chance of making the jui autocomplete a little nicer? like matching exact vs partial.. or match at start.. or highlight matching term
[10:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Customize those in the source option.
[10:10:35] <_zoggy_> ive already done these things myself but it would be nice if it was just built in
[10:10:41] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the tooltip behaviour is fine, applies to any other tooltip on inputs
[10:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that "it would be nice if it was just built in" applies to hundreds of features.
[10:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> Write an extension.
[10:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> Which adds an option.
[10:11:18] <_zoggy_> https://github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard/blob/master/data/js/browser.js#L112
[10:17:45] <_zoggy_> sure, but these features used to exist in the autocomplete (back when it was on bassistance.de) before jui took it over

[10:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> There's no more 1.next milestone in Trac (that was the flood of emails).
[10:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> I added 1.10, 1.11.0, and 2.0.0 milestones.
[10:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> *1.10.0
[11:10:24] <_zoggy_> 'no theme' from the drop down results in theme folder 'no-theme' correct?
[11:10:29] <_zoggy_> or shouldnt that just be empty?
[11:10:46] <_zoggy_> the tooltip says it defaults to 'theme'
[11:13:38] <_zoggy_> themroller help tab: ThemeRoller uses CSS3 border-radius for its round corners. Due to lack of support, corners will appear square in Internet Explorer. ThemeRoller also currently produces transparent PNG images. We plan to upgrade the icons to support IE6 very soon, but for the time being, you will need to use a pngFix plugin to get good-looking icons in IE6.
[11:13:42] <_zoggy_> need to be updated?
[11:14:24] <_zoggy_> rxaviers, the theme roller 'Drop Shadows' the labels and the input boxes are off in ff, all the other sections are fine
[11:14:42] <_zoggy_> well corner radius is off too
[11:15:56] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, no-theme is correct, because you still have css other than theme css to make widgets work properly
[11:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> We should update that to say IE 6 and 7.
[11:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> And we have IE6 support for icons, so that text should be dropped.
[11:17:00] <_zoggy_> actually all the labels are off in the themeroller accordion
[11:17:13] <_zoggy_> and correction, im in chrome 22 not ff
[11:24:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer,  the tooltip says `It defaults to "theme"` about theme folder name. It actually defaults to the theme name or "custom-theme" or "no-theme" depending of the occasion. Shall we simply remove that sentence? It seems unnecessary
[11:24:48] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ^
[11:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> removing sounds good
[11:25:27] <rxaviers> ok
[11:25:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, I've also tested DLB in IE6 and IE7 and tabular content is all messy :'(
[11:26:58] <rxaviers> I need to refact it. Anyone good in html/css cross compat willing to give a hand? My doubt it: what shall I use that has better browser compat? float:left, display:table or anything else?
[11:27:25] <rxaviers> (Im also researching in the meanwhile
[11:27:27] <rxaviers> )
[11:27:46] <_zoggy_> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-table
[11:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like broken comments.
[11:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> display: table probably has bad compat.
[11:28:51] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, good link,
[11:28:57] <rxaviers> yeap
[11:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Do you want me to look into this?
[11:30:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, well, let me try it out first then.
[11:31:13] <rxaviers> I was just wondering a quick tip for a direction right now. Not critically not doable
[11:34:55] <scott_gonzalez> I just pushed a fix for the broken comment.
[11:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[12:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: If I have a checkout of download.jqueryui.com and I've already run `grunt prepare` is there something I can do to get a zip of all components and the base (smoothness) theme?
[12:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Let me clarify: Is there something I can do from the command line.
[12:15:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, previous builder unit test was building the zip, then you could have access to that file. But, current builder unit test only checks paths now without building it itself
[12:16:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, no easy way from cmd line to build it
[12:17:24] <rxaviers> Want a grunt task for that?
[12:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> A grunt task would work.
[12:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> I need something to use in the release script to generate the quick download.
[12:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> The old release process was: 1) update the site with new files 2) deploy to stage 3) manually download from stage 4) add zip to site 5) deploy to production
[12:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> pretty ghetto
[12:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> brb
[12:23:49] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, the quick download is all components selected with smoothness theme (or default ui-lightness)?
[12:27:03] <rxaviers> brb in 30min
[12:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> back
[12:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: all components + smoothness theme
[12:53:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pong
[12:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: My memory doesn't last that long :-P
[12:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'll start with some obvious questions.
[12:53:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it was that extra one minute past that hour huh
[12:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> Are the *.jqueryui.com sites ready to go live if we tag?
[12:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> probably, stupid minutes
[12:54:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, it kinda depends on DNS being there
[12:54:22] <gnarf> since it has to push to http://jqueryui.com/....
[12:54:38] <gnarf> the process is in place
[12:54:39] <gnarf> yes
[12:54:47] <gnarf> but it points to domains that aren't pointing to jq01
[12:55:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: best way to push right now is on a machine that has faked hosts entries
[12:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I just realized something.
[12:55:57] <gnarf> i suppose i could edit /etc/hosts on jq02
[12:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: new TR does a request to jqueryui.com for images, right?
[12:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> That'll fail as soon as we deploy the new site.
[12:56:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what images, should we put them up on the CDN?
[12:57:03] <gnarf> or is it still requesting images from the old TR?
[12:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> For the generated theme images.
[12:57:15] * gnarf frowns
[12:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> We saved a lot of time by not doing all the image generation.
[12:57:25] <gnarf> yeah
[12:57:34] <scott_gonzalez> Can we setup DNS for old.jqueryui.com?
[12:57:35] <gnarf> understood
[12:58:05] <gnarf> probably, but convincing the old.jqueryui.com to serve out on that url and not try to redirect you every time you hit it might be a trick
[12:58:17] <gnarf> im confused tho
[12:58:26] <gnarf> the old themeroller isn't a part of jqueryui.com is it?
[12:58:30] <gnarf> the wordpress site?
[12:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> no
[12:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> We have a new TR which is in the download.jqueryui.com repo.
[12:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> The new jqueryui.com has a front-end that POSTs to download.jqueryui.com
[12:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> But download.jqueryui.com makes a request to (old) jqueryui.com for the image generation.
[12:59:37] <gnarf> jqueryui.com/themeroller
[12:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> And that URL exists in the new site as well, for the TR front-end
[13:00:18] <gnarf> umm hrm
[13:00:27] <gnarf> do you have ssh access to jqueryui.com scott?
[13:00:47] <gnarf> danheberden: can you help me with this ^^^^
[13:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> On my old laptop I do.
[13:01:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i need to see how the old themeroller is setup
[13:01:47] <danheberden> wat?
[13:01:50] <danheberden> gnarf?
[13:02:00] <danheberden> can you distill the backlog into an action for me? :p
[13:02:13] <gnarf> danheberden: i need ssh on jqueryui.com
[13:02:19] <danheberden> NO!
[13:02:23] <danheberden> jk :D
[13:02:24] <gnarf> my key doesn't appear to work
[13:03:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: my thought is we need to move just the old themeroller somewhere near the new one
[13:03:14] <gnarf> also, I'm not sure I have a themeroller staged yet
[13:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> ThemeRoller is part of download.jqueryui.com.
[13:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta take Mya to dance. We might need to do this tomorrow.
[13:05:27] <gnarf> okay
[13:07:02] <gnarf> I'll try to be around earlier tomorrow
[13:24:41] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: what are the two jqui boxes?
[13:24:45] <danheberden> i can't remember
[13:24:52] <danheberden> not proxy, but the two that run them
[13:26:04] <danheberden> oh, nvm
[13:26:05] <danheberden> got it
[13:37:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: looking at this, /themeroller seems to be a self contained php app, so I should be able to move it over to one of the "eol" boxes and setup something like "oldtheme.jqueryui.com"

[14:37:53] <rxaviers> gnarf, sure
[14:38:10] <rxaviers> please, just let me know the new url

[14:56:47] <gnarf> rxaviers: any idea how to turn off deprecation warnings?
[14:57:53] * rxaviers researching
[14:58:22] <rxaviers> gnarf, what's the installed php version and what's the old server's ?
[14:58:31] <gnarf> 5.3 / 5.2
[14:58:50] <gnarf> 5.3.17-1~dotdeb.0 with Suhosin-Patch
[14:59:00] <gnarf> 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 with Suhosin-Patch 0.9.6.2
[14:59:28] <gnarf> rxaviers: I guess I can keep the old server alive a bit longer
[15:00:45] <rxaviers> gnarf, it seems 5.3 has deprecated eregi() and so far I found only people complaining about it (no solution yet) beside actually changing the code.
[15:01:13] <rxaviers> gnarf, just wondering, is it possible to install 5.2/
[15:01:16] <gnarf> well there is a fatal at the end of all those deprecations
[15:01:31] <gnarf> rxaviers: its so hard to run two php versions on one apache
[15:01:39] <rxaviers> rxaviers, ah! ok
[15:01:45] <gnarf> i'd rather have another vm with 5.2
[15:05:24] <gnarf> rxaviers: let me try getting that url working on the old servers
[15:05:40] <rxaviers> gnarf, yeap, it seems `$this->` needs to be changed to `self::`... We can always fix/upgrade those errors. But, we never know how many of them we are going to find. I think the safest choice would be to try to replicate the env.

[15:06:30] <rxaviers> gnarf, just let me know how I can help. I have some knowledge in linux (I've worked at IBM LTC) :)
[15:07:10] <gnarf> rxaviers: will do, seems moving it is a bad idea tho :)
[15:07:34] <gnarf> brb, 40 min or so

[19:10:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that should be fixed on stage right?
[19:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yeah, I didn't see it because the file I checked was cached.
