[05:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I feel like this was in other changes as well, but I've been holding back from commenting: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/b201139d4169b13136d0875c9297191f956434f4#commitcomment-9820655
[05:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I just got to a point where it was bothering me too much :-P
[05:49:32] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok
[05:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/fa10c1d724f875b8898af20861b7106394060a01#commitcomment-9820991
[05:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> The second comment
[05:50:54] <arschmitz> that commit and the 2 after it should have been squashed
[05:51:12] <arschmitz> into the original classes commits
[05:52:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the last one the shopping cart one should stay its unrelated Jorn just asked me to delete it while i was making all the other droppable changes
[05:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's separate.
[05:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, can you address the current comments and do the squashes, then I'll do another round of review?
[05:52:50] <arschmitz> yup
[05:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> I skipped all the hasClass/lacksClass commits because I had a comment asking about the functionality.
[05:53:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok whats the question about that?
[05:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1411#commitcomment-9820883
[05:55:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: the mixed tests are all updated in the following commits 
[05:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I think you know what I'm going to say about that ;-)
[05:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> They should be right in the first commit :-)
[05:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> Is it a strict test?
[05:56:36] <arschmitz> it is not a strict check and never was meant to be. I am however adding a sperate strict check
[05:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> So when you say they're updated, does that mean that we just never use `element.hasClass()`?
[05:57:04] <arschmitz> that im going to update to use in some places where it makes more sense
[05:57:12] <arschmitz> thats correct
[05:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:57:28] <arschmitz> and the only uses of is are where its not a simple class check
[05:57:35] <arschmitz> and no uses of attr( "class"
[05:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'll finish the review after the cleanup and squash.
[05:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think there was anything big in this round.
[05:58:27] <arschmitz> as far as the specific tests that are mixed and some of the other stuff yeah thats stuff that got squashed into the wrong commit and ill fix it
[05:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> Other than the widget factory tests org.
[05:58:41] <arschmitz> yes
[05:58:56] <arschmitz> basicly pretty much everything in the test files is fixed already other then that
[05:59:02] <arschmitz> i just need to move it into the correct commit
[06:02:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ill do that this afternoon i need to get some stuff done for mobile this morning
[06:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[06:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> I've got plenty of other stuff to do :-)

[12:17:50] <jasperdegroot> scott_gonzalez: will do
[12:18:16] <jasperdegroot> thought I already did sign with that email address
[12:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> You signed with mail@
[12:25:24] <jasperdegroot> yes, that's also what I use in my git config. but I thought I also signed with jasper@ because that was in my config on my old machine
[12:26:15] <jasperdegroot> funny thing is that I disappeared from the CLA Google sheet
[12:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't disappear. You never signed. You signed the CAA.
