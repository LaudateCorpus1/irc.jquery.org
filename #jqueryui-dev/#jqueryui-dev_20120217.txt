[07:53:56] <kborchers> wish i would have known this meeting was happening :(
[10:54:26] <toddmparker_> sorry kborchers - we'll invite you properly next time
[12:29:35] <kborchers> toddmparker_: oh, no problem. :) thanks!
[13:11:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i hate IE. I can not find a way around that double focus crap. definitely has to do with docs#6705 and not sure if i should spend the time trying to fix that
[13:11:34] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, [#6705] focus() causes focus event to be handled twice in IE8 (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/6705
[13:17:06] <kborchers> only thing i've come up with to work around is a flag that just says don't log any after the first but after i wrote that, i slapped my hand, cried a little and reverted it since it would be bad if there really were extra ones being fired by all browsers that would cause the test to fail but we would never know
[13:19:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also, when you have a sec could you point me at some info on writing docs (new way, old way, what ever I should do) for Menu since that probably needs to happen for 1.9
