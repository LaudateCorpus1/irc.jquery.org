[06:38:29] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: just wanted to do another button review, but it looks like a lot of my comment from the last review 19 days ago aren't addressed
[06:38:41] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: Am I missing something? As an example: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1216/files#r16240671
[06:39:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we talked about using a new branch rebased on classes
[06:39:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: which is not ready yet because i need to ask scott a few questions which im waiting for him to have time to get to
[06:40:09] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its ready other then classes so i can push and you can review that if you would like 
[06:41:41] <jzaefferer> that works for me
[06:41:51] <arschmitz> ok just one second
[06:53:49] <jzaefferer> Its been more than 10 minutes :p
[06:54:06] <arschmitz> sorry im writting the pr and putting some notes in it

[06:57:44] <jzaefferer> thanks
[06:58:12] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: kinda related, looking at the controlgroup spec: What's the deal with the excludeInvisible option? I remember discussing this before, but not the details
[06:58:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we discussed in the meeting we should support it
[06:58:56] <arschmitz> it was a month or so ago i would guess
[06:59:58] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:00:49] <jzaefferer> the transformed markup has a non-namespaced "controlgroup" class, is that supposed to be there?
[07:02:39] <arschmitz> thats just showing if it starts with that class its still there
[07:03:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its in the inital markup and the transformed or should be thats what i intended
[07:03:13] <jzaefferer> oh, right
[07:03:30] <jzaefferer> the second html comment also says "Default horizontal direction", should be "vertical" here
[07:04:03] <jzaefferer> "should we support textinputs and selectmenus?" - once we have textinput, yes to both
[07:04:15] <jzaefferer> "should we support hidden elements? we do in mobile." - is that still a question?
[07:05:53] <jzaefferer> Looks like everything from my April comment is addressed. Not sure about the bug report below, can you check that, then delete those comments?
[07:06:06] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: now to review the new PR :-)
[07:06:12] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: ill take care of that
[07:06:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ^^
[07:06:30] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Also i added the textinput spec
[07:06:32] <JamesMGreene> I was going to say "???" :)
[07:06:42] <arschmitz> and have written a prototype widget that implements it
[07:07:32] <jzaefferer> shouldn't https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1216 be closed?
[07:07:51] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes ill do it right now

[07:24:41] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: demos/button/index.html needs an update, lists deleted demos
[07:25:15] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ok thanks i thought i cleaned up all the demos stuff i missed that one
[07:26:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i made real demos and moved the old checkboxradio demo to visual tests like you had mentioned a LONG time ago
[07:26:32] <jzaefferer> cool
[07:32:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: how do i delete wiki comments?
[07:34:13] <jzaefferer> log in, be an admin, click delete?
[07:34:22] <arschmitz> maybe im not an admin?
[07:34:25] <jzaefferer> guess you're not an admin :-)
[07:34:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: don't think so
[07:35:08] <jzaefferer> trying to fix that
[07:35:19] <jzaefferer> there
[07:35:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thanks
[07:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I usually leave the comment for a week or so to give a chance to respond with context.
[07:39:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: these were old and addressed ( one was from jzaefferer ) the other was just someone trying to look at a demo while i was in the middle of pushing some changes
[07:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[07:39:38] <arschmitz> both were several months ago
[07:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> Must've deleted them before I viewed.
[07:40:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i left one which i just responded to
[07:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I thought you might be asking about that one.
[07:40:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: gotcha 
[07:41:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah makes sense because this is something we decided talked about quite a while back 
[07:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:41:58] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: there's a bunch of issues with CSS and demos and tests, I commented on those
[07:42:13] <jzaefferer> I'd prefer to continue this review after you addressed those, will make the rest of the review much more effective
[07:42:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im looking right now
[07:42:39] <jzaefferer> active style being broken is the most glaring, the rest is mostly oversights when creating or moving demos
[07:42:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: something is strange with some of those pages
[07:43:03] <arschmitz> yeah the button states something went weird there im looking
[07:43:30] <jzaefferer> Let me know when you've addressed those, I'll try to continue the review asap then
[07:43:41] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah im doing it right this second
[07:44:13] <jzaefferer> I'm not counting on your "just a second" estimate :p
[07:44:22] <arschmitz> i didnt say it would be a second
[07:44:24] <arschmitz> this time
[07:44:30] <arschmitz> i said im doing it right this second :-)
[07:54:51] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: just pushed fix for active state
[07:56:32] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: also a bunch of other things in your comment that were quick fixes
[07:57:25] <jzaefferer> I don't need the real world demos for my review, but everything else would be good to have addressed
[07:58:20] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: other then that the only thing i just saw i missed was renaming icon.html to icons.html
[08:04:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: glad you like the toolbar demo though i spent like a full day making it work well lol
[08:05:34] <jzaefferer> have fun maintaining it forever :-)
[08:05:53] <jzaefferer> There's a fine line between real world demos and something-that-should-be-a-widget
[08:06:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: there is almost no js or logic to it
[08:06:20] <arschmitz> i just had not idea how to really work with content editable lol
[08:07:16] <jzaefferer> yeah, its surprisingly simple in the end, otherwise I would've been less excited. Still a little questionable if it can stay like that
[08:09:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its a super simplified version of one ppk made

[08:15:11] <arschmitz> someone offered to look at a css issue i noticed but needed a place to look
[08:15:59] <jzaefferer> okay, makes sense
[08:16:14] <jzaefferer> Are you going to switch your PR over? Is that even possible?
[08:16:25] <arschmitz> um im not sure i can try it does not matter to me
[08:16:58] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: does not look like it 
[08:17:18] <arschmitz> it would need to be a new pr to switch it i think
[08:18:05] <jzaefferer> let's do a new PR then. I don't want to switch between forks to figure out which one to look at
[08:18:21] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[08:18:26] <jzaefferer> long running refactors like this are good to have in the jquery-ui repo anyway
[08:18:45] <arschmitz> yeah i had it there to begin with not sure why i used my fork this time
[08:19:01] <arschmitz> probably because i was using it to rebase and just didnt think :/

[10:08:08] <jzaefferer> Nice
[10:13:42] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: that's silly. Just remove the `return` and split the chained call on two lines
[10:14:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: sweet

[11:43:40] <arschmitz> accordion you can ignore im reverting that after talking to scott_gonzalez
[11:43:58] <arschmitz> however the same thing happens on a button test that i currently have commented out
