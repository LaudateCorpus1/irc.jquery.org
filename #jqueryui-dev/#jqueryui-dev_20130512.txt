[01:53:15] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott, just checking something for the api docs. In UI, when you keep one doc version for each main release which you update with maintenance releases, is that right? (so 1.10 started with 1.10.0, then 1.10.1, etc... and today it's 1.10.3), and you refer to it using 1.10 (not 1.10.3)?
[01:54:34] <agcolom> (to be sure before I do the same for mobile... so instead of saying 1.3.0 or 1.3.1 now, I'll refer to it as 1.3)
[07:33:38] <gnarf> agcolom: yes, no reason to document point releases because the API shouldn't change
[10:26:09] <agcolom> gnarf: Thx :-)

[19:43:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin i've made some updates to dry out all of those bindings and track last touch similar to what dojo does but instead of creating a new timestamp, i just use the one on the events https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions-pointer/external/pointer.js
