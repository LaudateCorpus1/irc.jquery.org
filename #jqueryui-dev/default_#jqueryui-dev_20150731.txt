[05:16:48] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey! At long last! http://jsperf.com/regex-vs-hasclasses
[05:17:01] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: That's jQuery 1.11.1
[05:17:39] <arschmitz> why did you use an old version
[05:18:28] <gabrielschulhof> I dunno ... I'm just used to it. What version should I use?
[05:18:35] <arschmitz> git
[05:18:41] <arschmitz> also
[05:18:48] <arschmitz> of course its faser
[05:18:50] <gabrielschulhof> 1.5-dev has 1.11.3
[05:19:29] <arschmitz> the question is not if its faster
[05:19:32] <arschmitz> its if it matters
[05:19:37] <arschmitz> this is microperf
[05:19:37] <gabrielschulhof> I think it does.
[05:19:56] <arschmitz> you think being able to check 400,000 elements per second is slowing us down? 
[05:19:57] <gabrielschulhof> Yes, but in listview, it may matter.
[05:20:12] <gabrielschulhof> That's why it was there in the first place.
[05:20:20] <gabrielschulhof> I'm planning on doing a much more extensive check.
[05:20:35] <gabrielschulhof> Instantiate a listview with 1.4.5 code, and then another one with 1.5.0 code.
[05:20:48] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: your check is also not really complete
[05:21:22] <gabrielschulhof> What else should I be checking?
[05:22:18] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: check out what core is doing
[05:22:20] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/classes.js
[05:23:51] <gabrielschulhof> OK ... why should I check that out?
[05:24:57] <arschmitz> im trying to find a refrence but im pretty sure you cant rely on className
[05:25:07] <arschmitz> which is why core uses attribute
[05:25:26] <gabrielschulhof> What do you mean "rely on className"?
[05:25:42] <arschmitz> on element.className giving you what you want
[05:26:02] <gabrielschulhof> Of course, but that's a space separated string, which I want to match to a regex.
[05:26:05] <gabrielschulhof> find js -type f | xargs grep -niH className
[05:26:10] <gabrielschulhof> We use className in a lot of places.
[05:28:00] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, wait.
[05:28:02] <gabrielschulhof> Misread.
[05:28:07] <gabrielschulhof> "cant", you said.
[05:28:20] <gabrielschulhof> Interesting.
[05:28:20] <arschmitz> right
[05:28:29] <arschmitz> im trying to find why
[05:28:35] <gabrielschulhof> We've been using className for a long time.
[05:28:37] <arschmitz> its a vague memory 
[05:29:04] <arschmitz> but im fairly sure there is a reason core is doing that
[05:29:40] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Let's git blame the core file.
[05:29:48] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thats what im doing
[05:29:53] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK :)
[05:30:04] <arschmitz> svg support
[05:30:06] <gabrielschulhof> Well, FWIW, we've been using className all the way since 1.0
[05:30:17] <gabrielschulhof> Well, we needn't worry about that.
[05:30:26] <gabrielschulhof> ... because we know we're dealing with DOM elements in listview.
[05:30:31] <arschmitz> i wonder if thats the perf difference
[05:30:45] <arschmitz> or if its something else i mean they are not doing a whole lot there
[05:30:58] <gabrielschulhof> No, but still, way more than a single .search()
[05:31:27] <arschmitz> im also not convinced this is enough to matter but we will see
[05:32:47] <gabrielschulhof> I have to dig up my 1.4.5 vs. 1.5.0 comparison. I've made custom builds for listview and I've actually namespaced everything so it doesn't overlap. Like, $.Widget145 and $.Widget150, and $.mobile145 and $.mobile150 ...
[05:32:58] <gabrielschulhof> I'm curious if I can actually get that to run in jsperf.
[05:36:29] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: if you really care you should be using test its much much faster then search
[05:37:15] <gabrielschulhof> Well, why not ...
[13:37:33] <jaoek> hello
[16:05:10] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: http://jsperf.com/listview-145-vs-150
[16:05:30] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: It's worse, but not disastrously.
[16:06:10] <gabrielschulhof> The biggest reduction is on Chrome/desktop, so that should not be significant.
