[00:35:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[00:35:25] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jayenashar opened issue #7350: can't enable rangeslider 02http://git.io/IjoAFA
[00:38:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[00:39:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was wondering whether you could exceptionally review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7347, because it's super-trivial, and it'd fix the build.
[00:39:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... for 1.4-stable
[00:40:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[00:40:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the build for the PR has passed.
[00:40:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I simply forgot that, in 1.4-stable, it's jquery.mobile.vmouse, and not vmouse, as it is on master.
[00:43:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7348/, do you think it might be possible to do it without the "!important" flags?
[00:45:21] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed pull request #7347: Checkboxradio: Add prefix to vmouse dep (061.4-stable...067346-add-prefix) 02http://git.io/7EFPFQ
[00:45:34] <_|Nix|_> OK, the build should really be OK now.
[00:45:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, it should be done without !important flags
[00:47:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You wanna comment, or shall I?
[00:47:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the ui-corner-none class was only something we wanted to add for convenience
[00:48:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: as a generic class, not on widget level
[00:48:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can talk about during our meeting
[00:48:33] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, let's do it that way.
[00:48:36] <uGoMobi> in 10 mins
[00:48:59] <uGoMobi> will also look at the wiki page to see if it's clear about this
[00:52:03] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[00:52:04] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #7350: can't enable rangeslider 02http://git.io/IjoAFA
[00:56:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could you please open the channel and handle the first, like, 10-15 minutes of the meeting? I need to go grab lunch.
[00:56:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[00:57:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks 1.0e6!
[00:59:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I think we might need to use !important for the ui-corner-none class
[00:59:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but not use a specific selector
[01:00:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just .ui-corners-none { border-radius: 0 !important; } in the theme CSS
[01:01:40] <uGoMobi> in general we don't use !important because we want users to be able to override, but when you decide to use this class you don't want to override anyway
[01:13:16] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1652 (1.4-stable - 271ea25 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build was fixed.

[01:54:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great!
[01:54:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the file structure change doesn't make cherry-picking into 1.4-stable easier ;-)
[01:56:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: since we meet on #jquery-meeting it might be good to log it here http://meetings.jquery.org/category/mobile/
[01:58:28] <uGoMobi> but we have to update it first with our April Mobile meetings
[01:58:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: are you around?
[02:01:10] <uGoMobi> ?tell agcolom: Were you already working on updating http://meetings.jquery.org/category/mobile/ ? I can do it if you don't have time. Just let me know. Thanks! 
[02:01:11] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Iâ€™ll tell agcolom: about that.
[03:15:31] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, I can do that today
[03:16:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne, awesome. Thanks!

[13:29:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7258 I can't find anything in the CLA signatories list resembling the OP.
[13:30:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just asked a question based on their writeup i have not looked at the pr yet
[13:31:36] <arschmitz> our support tests come from grunticon and they talk about changing them so i asked if this was where they got it from
[13:33:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you paste them that checklist you've been giving in a bunch of PRs? That's actually really cool!
[13:33:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also not that it matters because we will ask for them to sign either way but if it was from grunticon they dont hold any claim to the code 
[13:34:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've noticed that whenever I click on a checkbox it Ajax-es something to GH.
[13:34:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, is this a new feature where you can add checkboxes like that?
[13:34:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes it saves the state
[13:34:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Who can modify the state? The OP plus those with write access?
[13:35:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or just those with write access?
[13:35:23] <arschmitz> no idea
[13:35:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess it must be just those with write access, because the OP could check of the "Signed CLA" without having signed the CLA.
[13:35:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, it's probably not geared specifically to our needs :)
[13:36:15] <arschmitz> not sure 
[13:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, in other news: I looked at getLocation() in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7263 again, and I have found a second reason why we should use our parsed URL instead of location directly. Our parsed URL provides the .doubleSlash field, whereas location does not.
[13:38:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so only use it for the double slash
[13:38:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Before, we were unconditionally concatenating a // into the resulting location, but the PR no longer does that.
[13:39:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're also using it for the hash, in the original code.
[13:39:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the modified code that remains unchanged.
[13:39:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but the browser gives us the hash ?
[13:40:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but for some reason we were grabbing the hash via parseUrl( location.href ).hash.
[13:40:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can git blame to try and find out why.
[13:40:35] <arschmitz> ok just because we are does not mean we should
[13:40:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll git blame that.
[13:43:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "parse the hash to avoid decoding in FF, but use the location object elsewhere to avoid the inclusion of the auth" -- John Bender in f6621155f473b9f23b2102a92ccf524f6b4be08d
[13:43:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it sounds like it's a good idea to use the location object.
[13:44:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. In that case, I'll maximize our use of the location object.
[13:46:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also check there there is still in issue in firefox
[13:46:36] <arschmitz> we only support current -1 and thats 2.5 years old
[13:50:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not quite sure what that comment means. Does it mean that FF gives/used to give you the hash encoded?
[13:55:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The closest I could find was https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2384, but that seems like it's solved by $.mobile.path.hashToSelector, and not by grabbing parsing location.href
[13:55:58] <arschmitz> ok so lets switch back to just using hash there too
[13:56:18] <arschmitz> and just make sure we test on firefox before that lands
[13:57:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's just it though. Test what? Just run the navigation tests?
[13:57:19] <arschmitz> yes
[13:57:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:57:38] <arschmitz> and try pulling the hash in different urls in firefox in the console
[13:57:49] <arschmitz> and make sure they are correct just as a sanity check
[13:58:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can just add a console.log to getLocation which spits out the hash.
[14:02:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: FF still decodes the hash, even today. Go to any page, then set your hash to #def%2Fabc%2F, then open the dev tools (Ctrl+Shift+K), and then type location.hash into the console.
[14:02:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It will spit out a decoded string.
[14:03:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep, and Chrome will give it to you encoded.
[14:03:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you still need to parse the location.href for the hash because of FF.
[14:04:07] <arschmitz> fair enough

[15:14:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: NP!
[15:15:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm used to cherry-picking my PRs, in fact, a little too used to it.
[15:15:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I cherry picked one which modifies AMD deps, and I forgot to re-add the jquery.mobile prefix :/
[15:15:56] <_|Nix|_> ... before I pushed the commit to 1.4-stable.
[15:16:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, there is a happy median ... somewhere.
[15:16:15] <gseguin> I thought git did fine with file renames
[15:16:28] <gseguin> because it keeps track of content 
[15:16:31] <gseguin> not files
[15:16:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yes, it does. But not with define( [ "../name.of.file", ... ]...
[15:16:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You have to change that to ../file yourself.
[15:17:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Because it's part of the content - so git treats it like a black box.
[15:17:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It might as well be an essay about ancient Mesopotamia, as far as git is concerned.
[15:18:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It wasn't a merge conflict/
