[05:08:13] <Acrack> hello
[05:08:48] <Acrack> is it possible to generate a pdf with jquery using a .xml file ?
[05:11:47] <kborchers> Acrack: this channel is for development of jQuery UI. you should try your question in #jquery
[05:12:00] <Acrack> i can't reach that channel :s
[05:12:03] <Acrack> this is why i asked here ^^
[05:12:12] <Acrack> seems that channel is offline
[05:12:25] <Acrack> (my bad)
[05:12:28] <Acrack> thanks =)

[05:52:18] <mikesherov> kborchers: sent you that info
[05:52:47] <kborchers> mikesherov: cool thanks!
[05:53:28] <mikesherov> can you give it a quick glance and let me know if you needed anything else? I have 20 minutes or so free now, and want to make sure you have what you need
[05:53:39] <kborchers> looking
[05:55:44] <kborchers> mikesherov: that looks like some great info. i think that will do. thanks again
[05:55:55] <mikesherov> kborchers: no problem
[05:56:21] <mikesherov> is there anything else I can add?
[06:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: lifecycle/inheritance: _super()/_superApply(), _destroy(), _getCreateEventData(), defaultElement, non-DOM widgets, redefining widgets
[06:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> common functionality: _show()/_hide(), _focusable()/_hoverable()
[06:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> keeping context: _on(), _delay()
[06:08:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: cool, thanks. i'm really struggling to spice up this talk :/ other than my xbox demo which won't take long, it's just a lot of talking through the 1.9 release blog basically. any suggestions?
[06:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> If the details aren't spicy enough, they're not geeky enough :-P
[06:12:56] <kborchers> yeah, you're probably right â€¦ trying to get final tweaks together to submit for translation today
[10:45:27] <nacin> does it look like a jQuery UI 1.9.2 will occur?
[11:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, I have an item on my todo list to merge stuff from master to 1-9-stable.
[11:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Anything in particular that you're looking for?
[11:01:49] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: nope, just trying to see how timing would work for our own upcoming major release. if anything breaks during testing, you'll be the first to know.
[11:02:11] <nacin> per meeting notes it looks like jQuery 1.8.3 was scrapped, so I wanted to check UI too.
[11:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer didn't want a 1.9.2, but I do.
[11:31:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Going to track down the last of the fails for the revived interactions units tonight
[11:31:31] <mikesherov> I finished sortable yesterday, and it passes in all the browsers
[11:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, I'll get that merged in a bit.
[11:34:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: NP, just to reiterate my priorities once that's merged: 1. fix test fails, including the weird IE8 position fail that doesn't fail locally. 2. finish triaging all remaning "new" tixx 3. mergeatron 4. requesting tests for all pulls against interactions or close them 5. interaction rewrites is there anything else you feel would be a better use of my time, or any other way I can help?
[11:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> That seems good. I could certainly point you at specific tasks, but in terms of general tasks, that looks good.
[11:39:31] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/d9KsWw
[11:39:31] <jquicommit> jquery-ui/master 68ad80c Mike Sherov: Dev: Standardize sortable test suite. Fixed #8755 - Dev: Get sortable test suite to pass
[11:47:19] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I want to know if there is anything specific you'd like done first. I can't say I'll do them, but I'd certainly like to know :-)
[11:47:20] <mikesherov> \
[12:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Two tickets in came recently that I think are pretty important: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8769 and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8762
[12:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be looking at those when I'm back from vacation next week.
[12:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> But if you wanted to look at them, I've got plenty of other stuff to work on too.
[12:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> Also http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8741 is a regression.
[12:03:34] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #756: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/756/
[12:03:35] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Dev: Standardize sortable test suite. Fixed #8755 - Dev: Get sortable test suite to pass
[12:54:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?
[13:59:31] <mikesherov> wow, look at the that. make test suites work and people will write tests: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8756
[13:59:50] <kborchers> heh, saw that :)
[14:01:09] <mikesherov> now, if only this guy would wait before we opened the ticket for a pull request, that's be awesome
[14:01:29] <kborchers> :)
[14:01:37] <kborchers> baby steps
[14:02:00] <kborchers> mikesherov: question â€¦ can you think of a real world example of where you would use a widget that isn't tied to a DOM element?
[14:03:07] <kborchers> not neceseraly a UI widget but something using the widget factory
[14:03:14] <kborchers> necessarily*
[14:05:08] <mikesherov> Um
[14:05:13] <mikesherov> isn't that what a widget is?
[14:05:20] <mikesherov> can't we just say that's what it is
[14:05:40] <mikesherov> I mean, the factory is nice
[14:08:02] <kborchers> mikesherov: i'm trying to explain why this is cool http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#allow-non-dom-based-widgets  i mean, i guess it gives you the ability to use the factory for parts of your app that don't have anything to do with the DOM which i guess is pretty cool
[14:09:45] <mikesherov> so, sure
[14:09:52] <mikesherov> implicit enforce namespacing
[14:11:42] <mikesherov> so, a real world example though would be a router
[14:13:01] <mikesherov> I mean, the question is kind of weird
[14:13:04] <mikesherov> it's not why it's cool
[14:13:09] <mikesherov> it's why it's desirable
[14:13:50] <kborchers> yeah, i guess cool was the wrong word
[14:14:37] <mikesherov> Like, the idea of the widget factor is that it abstracts out namespacing and event binding
[14:14:53] <mikesherov> and gives you a standard way to create models, essentially
[14:15:12] <mikesherov> But I wouldn't even be touting that, that's just me personally
[14:15:30] <mikesherov> like, we should be in the business of promoting it's uses in UI widgets
[14:15:40] <mikesherov> I have a feeeling it'll bite us in the futue
[14:15:58] <mikesherov> the way jQuery core laments endorsing non core use cases
[14:17:34] <kborchers> maybe, i guess we'll see. :) thanks
[17:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov kborchers: It was added specifically to support data sources for the grid.
[17:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov's example of a router is good.
[17:25:54] <kborchers> ah, ok â€¦ yeah, i like the router example
[17:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> Anything that supports configuration and triggers events is a good candidate for the widget factory.
[17:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> There wasn't much needed to make the widget factory work for non-DOM.
[17:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> Basically just event trigerring.
[17:27:15] <kborchers> every time i read non-DOM my head says Gangnam
[17:27:17] <kborchers> :D
[17:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[17:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Is this a byte saver? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/864/files#L1L184
[18:12:28] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: gibson042 only does byte savers
[18:13:36] <mikesherov> so the counterintuitive things that he does are just because of huffman
[18:13:55] <mikesherov> gzip loves repeated sets of strings in similar spaces
[18:15:18] <mikesherov> although, I don't see specifically why that would save anything
[18:15:29] <mikesherov> but I always figure he just always tests that
