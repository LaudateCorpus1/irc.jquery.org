[14:05:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[14:05:27] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[14:06:06] <arschmitz> hey been doing some thinking on theme inheritance
[14:08:07] <arschmitz> and realized why persistant toolbars are flashing unstyled
[14:08:30] <arschmitz> its not unstyled its unthemed
[14:08:45] <arschmitz> because how they work is they copy them to the body durring transition then remove
[14:08:46] <uGoMobi> right
[14:09:15] <uGoMobi> so you have to set a theme for them, like everything else outside a page
[14:09:19] <arschmitz> so theres no real way to make that work with new theme system
[14:09:40] <arschmitz> yeah or....
[14:09:50] <arschmitz> why not set default theme on body
[14:10:13] <arschmitz> rather then
[14:10:15] <arschmitz> page
[14:10:26] <arschmitz> and have page set its theme on body
[14:10:55] <arschmitz> then everything would continue to work essentially the same as it did for 1.3
[14:11:02] <uGoMobi> how about multi-page templates?
[14:11:18] <arschmitz> what about it?
[14:11:58] <uGoMobi> nevermind, you mean, when a page is shown we set theme on body
[14:12:05] <arschmitz> yes
[14:12:12] <uGoMobi> there is one problem
[14:12:30] <uGoMobi> he theming system works with specificity levels
[14:12:41] <arschmitz> right
[14:12:51] <uGoMobi> and use html and body in selectors to increase the level
[14:12:59] <uGoMobi> when I can't use body
[14:13:22] <arschmitz> hmmm
[14:13:23] <uGoMobi> I can't make that work
[14:14:04] <arschmitz> then the only way to make persistant toolbars work inside or outside a page is by setting and explicit theme
[14:14:33] <uGoMobi> another issue is that for panels we used to set panel theme for the page (the wrapper gets the page theme)
[14:14:50] <arschmitz> or going back tp getinherited theme
[14:14:55] <uGoMobi> this is going to be overlay theme on body
[14:15:22] <uGoMobi> I don't like to go back to the JS solution
[14:15:36] <arschmitz> neither do i
[14:16:09] <uGoMobi> so we have to make clear that you have to set a theme for everything that's not inside a page
[14:16:15] <arschmitz> so panels, popups, and persistant toolbars all will not work with inheritance
[14:16:26] <arschmitz> even inside a page
[14:16:30] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Just chiming in with an additional reason to not use the JS solution: If we use it, we should make sure that subsequent theme changes are propagated to all those who would inherit themes by triggering a signal.
[14:16:32] <uGoMobi> popups are moved inside the page when shown
[14:16:35] <uGoMobi> so that works
[14:16:41] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[14:17:47] <uGoMobi> for panels I am looking into making it work because we will be setting overlay theme on body
[14:18:05] <uGoMobi> maybe I'll make it inherit from that
[14:18:06] <_|Nix|_> So, the API should actually be $.mobile.setInheritedTheme rather than getInheritedTheme, and each element upon which this function is called would result in a handler for this new signal getting attached to the document so that it can be informed of theme changes. Very heavy, and we're doing the job of CSS.
[14:18:55] <_|Nix|_> Though from what you're saying it's no easy feat in CSS either.
[14:19:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we are already setting overlay theme on the body now to improve page transitions, maybe I can make persistent toolbars inherit from that
[14:20:01] <uGoMobi> that shouldn't be too hard, just have to check when/how we set that overlay theme
[14:21:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: basically it's same as what you suggesting but not with ui-page-theme-* but with ui-overlay-*
[14:21:50] <arschmitz> ok
[14:21:54] <uGoMobi> s/you/you're/
[14:22:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree it would be nice if we can make this work
[14:22:48] <arschmitz> would it be possible to make all widget inherit from that if they are outside page?
[14:23:01] <arschmitz> like give it the lowest specificity
[14:24:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have to give it a closer look
[14:24:46] <uGoMobi> not sure if I run into problems
[14:24:56] <arschmitz> that would be ideal
[14:25:13] <arschmitz> then they will continue to work as intended
[14:25:14] <uGoMobi> the thing is, if they inherit from overlay on body, page theme should override
[14:25:42] <uGoMobi> that means I have to use something like html ui-page-* as selector
[14:26:25] <uGoMobi> that means I don't have enough selectors to make a specific theme on a button or something override everything else
[14:26:43] <arschmitz> i see
[14:27:02] <uGoMobi> can I use "head" as selector? :)
[14:27:10] <uGoMobi> html + head ...
[14:27:16] <arschmitz> sure
[14:27:22] <arschmitz> pretty sure
[14:27:23] <uGoMobi> then I have one more to use
[14:27:32] <uGoMobi> cool, never tried
[14:28:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I'll look into this
[14:28:45] <arschmitz> ok
[14:29:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I merged grunticon in master locally
[14:29:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I need you help with the support test
[14:29:24] <arschmitz> ok
[14:29:52] <uGoMobi> it works, but the no-svg class is added in support.js instead of init
[14:30:05] <arschmitz> ok
[14:30:15] <uGoMobi> that is because the test has to wait for img.onload
[14:30:34] <arschmitz> ok
[14:30:41] <uGoMobi> and I didn't know how to extend $.support while waiting for that event
[14:31:02] <arschmitz> cool push it and i can take a look at what you have
[14:31:09] <uGoMobi> I'll push that soon.. tweaking theme a bit
[14:31:14] <arschmitz> sure
