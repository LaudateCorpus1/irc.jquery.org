[09:58:25] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yt?
[10:01:52] <jzaefferer> gnarf: here
[10:02:22] <gnarf> jzaefferer: coo - i got that download builder running on stage, i don't have the nginx frontend proxy on it yet, but it works at :3000
[10:02:36] <jzaefferer> saw that, nice work
[10:02:56] <jzaefferer> also looks like you've got a handle on updating that deployment
[10:03:54] <jzaefferer> updating download builder itself when we, well, update it, and running grunt prepare for UI updates
[10:04:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf: we're working on also cloning the api.jqueryui.com repo as part of that prepare task, to generate docs
[10:05:15] <jzaefferer> not sure if versions of that will always line up with UI itself?
[10:05:25] <gnarf> probably not
[10:06:20] <jzaefferer> I think for now we can get away with just pulling docs from the master branch

[13:16:21] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: nice (re jQuery UI index page). the last sentence says: "... or browse a category:" I am wondering whether "... or browse by category: " would be better (but then I may be wrong... as English is not my 1st language... Just checking...
[13:17:26] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I can do something similar for the jQuery Mobile index page. Thanks for that.
[13:29:59] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is this magic? the index page now says browse by category!
[14:00:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 1-8-stable: http://git.io/wtQBng
[14:00:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Position: Create curCSS alias if it doesn't exist. Fixes #8501 - 1.8 Compat; Position still uses $.curCSS. - Scott González
[14:15:03] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I would add a small gap before the last line (jQuery UI 1.9 supports jQuery 1.6 and newer.)  (also the li for the 4 categories are not in a <ul> so maybe this gap could be achieved by having the 4 <li> in a <ul>)
[14:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Haha, I fixed it after I took the screenshot, but before you wrote that message :-P
[14:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Agreed on the spacing, there hasn't been any styling applied to the site yet. It's just running off the initial theme work right now.
[14:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> You may have noticed the API site looking a bit bland :-P
[14:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Oh, interesting. I didn't even notice they weren't in a <ul>. That list is generated by WordPress, I assumed it would include the full list, not just the items.
[14:32:37] <nacin> ahem.
[14:33:46] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: strange about that ul then! WordPress should know better ;-)
[14:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps I should've looked at the examples: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_categories#Examples
[14:34:33] <nacin> I imagine there's a reason for it, but who knows.
[14:35:34] <agcolom> ah! that's good to know!
[14:40:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: why not switch to jQuery.css instead of aliasing jQuery.curCSS ?
[14:40:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Because we support versions of jQuery were jQuery.css doesn't exist.
[14:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> s/were/where/
[14:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> This is 1.8.x only.
[14:40:55] <gnarf> i thought jQuery.curCss = jQuery.css since like 1.5
[14:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> We support 1.3.2+
[14:41:10] <gnarf> oh - 1-8-stable
[14:41:12] <gnarf> sry
[14:41:17] <gnarf> caught up now :)
[14:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> but, just for the record, it was 1.4.3
[14:41:56] <gnarf> cool
[14:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> master just uses $.css directly without the shim.
[14:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> Supportin 1.3.2 is getting crazy.
[14:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm glad that's coming to an end.
[14:43:00] <gnarf> :)
[14:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> UI 1.8.x supports 18 versions of core.
[14:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> And with 1.8.1 coming out soon, that will probably go up to 19 versions.
[14:44:05] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to go ahead and add the latest jQ and jQUI to WP master. anything I should know?
[14:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> There are some selector bugs in jQuery.
[14:44:57] <nacin> to be handled in 1.8.1?
[14:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[14:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ^
[14:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.0 has a complete rewrite of Sizzle.
[14:45:29] <nacin> right, I recall.
[14:45:55] <gnarf> and effects! (haven't seen many bugs on that yet tho)
[14:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> It fixed a lot of selector bugs, but had some regressions on complex selectors we weren't testing.
[14:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's the deal with the 0 duration animations?
[14:46:16] <nacin> looking now through the 1.8.1 tickets.
[14:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.0 does a single tick animation. 1.7.2 just skipped the animation.
[14:46:48] <nacin> I'll toss 1.8 into our master tonight, maybe something else will come up we can report.
[14:46:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 0 duration should set to the final value immediately then resolve
[14:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nacin: You should wait until 1.8.23 comes out (tomorrow).
[14:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> There's a dialog bug that was caused by a list minute change in core.
[14:47:32] <nacin> okay, I'll do both tomorrow then.
[14:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It sort of does, but it goes through the easing.
[14:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> And all easings to date use duration and expect it to be >0.
[14:48:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ahhhhh
[14:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> Minus the built-in ones in core, which started only relying in state a while ago.
[14:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> So this caused a problem in UI 1.8.x which used the old easing equations.
[14:48:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is there a core bug for this?
[14:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> But master was fine because of the rewrite to only rely on state.
[14:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> 12273
[14:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12273
[14:49:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool, i could have it check for duration === 0 and just assume "1" every time
[14:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that would work.
[14:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> Read through the comments.
[14:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> I explain how it's a breaking change, but I dropped the easing rewrite into 1-8-stable to fix it in 1.8.23 anyway.
[14:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> But if anyone is using the original easing plugin, that's going to be broken.
[15:14:33] <sw33tlull4by> hi there! i got a little problem with the jquery-ui in jquery-mobile but i belive it to be a ui-problem, http://pastebin.com/q4009eCw this snippet shows content causing problems, when that is shown i get checkboxes and everything is fine, BUT, if I want to change the state of these boxes using JS, i get the attribute set but it is not shown visually, calling button('refresh') causes an error saying that button has to be initiali
[15:27:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but in a "duration 0" animation, it makes sense to avoid easing altogether
[15:27:55] <gnarf> sw33tlull4by: try in #jquerymobile as well?  I'm not sure
[15:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yes, I think it makes sense to skip the easing and just pass through to .css()
[15:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't duration 0 behave like $.fx.off?
[15:28:37] <sw33tlull4by> yeah figgured this to be for the development of jquery-ui rather than development with jquery-ui so i switched to #jquery and asked again, thx though
[15:29:21] <sw33tlull4by> because the problem is present in jquery-ui as well regardless of jquery-mobile beeing present or not
[15:29:42] <sw33tlull4by> unfortunatly a search turned up no solution suiting my needs
[15:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> sw33tlull4by: So create a live demo showing the problem on jsFiddle and create a ticket at http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[15:30:25] <sw33tlull4by> will do thanks
[16:00:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
