[14:46:38] <Tomashe> Hey guys
[14:46:42] <Tomashe> anyone available
[14:47:13] <Tomashe> i got some wierd issue going on with jquery mobile + handle bars.
[14:50:54] <Tomashe> im i have a page with alot of divs , each div has his own data-role page and unique id, when my app is loading i use handlebars template engine to load data inside, once the data is is i using $('#mypage').enhanceWithin(); to initialize the componenets inside. now when i first enter a new page for eample #mypage1 and do t all work fine, i switch to other page #mypage2 still all fine, when 
[14:50:55] <Tomashe> i back to mypage1 again (dont forget in every page i go i load the new content inside including footer and header) then design breaks. it looks like enhanceWithin(); isnt working for me twise on same page, in additional it also move the footer outside of the data-role="page" container. any ideas?
