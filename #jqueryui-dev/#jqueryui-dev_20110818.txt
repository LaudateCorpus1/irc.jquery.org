[01:50:26] <senech_a> hi
[08:57:04] <gnarf> can someone else take a look at the datepicker demo in ie7?
[08:57:16] <gnarf> it seems to be popping back open after selecting a date
[08:58:04] <kborchers> gnarf: i'm headed to a meeting but if noone else can i will take a look when i get back. about an hour at the most
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> it's fixed in 1.8.16
[09:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> and there are like a million tickets for it
[09:09:45] <gnarf> heh
[09:09:46] <gnarf> ok
[09:09:47] <gnarf> nvm then
[12:27:26] <jzaefferer> kborchers: if you scroll down enough for the three buttons to be at the top of the screen, then hover them, the tooltip should flip down, right? for some reason, it gets displayed over the button, making it unusable: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/tooltip/tooltip.html
[12:27:30] <jzaefferer> could you take a look at that?
[12:28:36] <kborchers> yep, i'll look at it
[12:34:37] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it's because the default collision in tooltip is "flip fit" causing it to fit over the button. that needs to change to "flip flip" if that is what is expected or just "flip" or even "flipfit"
[12:35:41] <kborchers> or i guess if you want "flip flip" then just don't specify a default collision
[12:37:01] <jzaefferer> mhm
[12:37:07] <jzaefferer> I wonder why it is "flip fit" right now
[12:37:20] <jzaefferer> probably because flip for vertical wasn't cool enough
[12:37:24] <kborchers> heh
[12:37:28] <jzaefferer> so flipfit flipfit seems like a fancy default now
[12:37:39] <kborchers> yeah, i think so
[12:39:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/qLlYxX
[12:39:43] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tooltip: Change default to flipfit for both dimensions, now that it is available. Fixes positioning issue when tooltipped element is at the top of the screen. - JoÌˆrn Zaefferer
[12:39:54] <jzaefferer> thanks for your input, I should've checked the defaults for tooltip first :-)
[12:40:13] <kborchers> no problem
[12:40:47] <jzaefferer> btw. talked with Felix just now, finally got rid of the remaining open issues: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[12:43:05] <jzaefferer> for the autoCollapse code, can you address the issue I just commented on, then send a PR?
[12:44:29] <kborchers> yep, will do
[12:44:40] <jzaefferer> for your other-markup-demo, could you add a link to your commit?
[12:45:16] <jzaefferer> looks like comments are already cleaned up :-)
[12:46:00] <kborchers> i will, i am reworking that solution as it wasn't really optimal. trying to do it with an items option like sortable does but it is proving to be a headache.
[12:46:10] <jzaefferer> okay
[12:46:20] <jzaefferer> let me know if there's something I can or should look at
[12:46:24] <kborchers> yeah,  i went through and cleaned up comments the other day
[12:46:26] <jzaefferer> may be able to provide some input
[12:48:45] <kborchers> scott had issues with wrapping the items in anchor tags which got us into the discussion about using the items option. here is the commit that the fiddle is running off of. any input would be appreciated https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/74d3ae3eb44f4db57cb7d9cc6d212f64d9260d85
[12:49:26] <kborchers> i'm not sure how the items thing was supposed to eliminate the anchor tag thing and i think a lot of the focus stuff is based around the anchor so ... thoughts?
[12:57:33] <jzaefferer> yeah, seems like the items option would make more sense
[13:00:13] <kborchers> ok, i can keep working on that. any thoughts on not requiring the anchor?
[14:11:50] <jzaefferer> ah, missed that: having it in by default seems fine, but being able to change that using the options also makes sense
[14:20:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, well i would vote leaving it in there as that is less i have to change ;) seriously though, i'll see how hard it looks to remove the anchor while implementing the items option and see how it goes
[15:13:20] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yt?
[17:04:11] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sup?
[21:54:20] <gnarf> anyone awake?
[21:54:29] <gnarf> are we sill using _tickets.js tests?
[21:54:39] <gnarf> i thought i read something somehwere about removing these
[21:54:49] <gnarf> maybe it was just "cleaning up
