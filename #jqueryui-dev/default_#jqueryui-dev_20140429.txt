[01:18:11] <frequent> uGoMobi: morning-ping!
[01:18:30] <uGoMobi> frequent: good morning!
[01:18:41] <frequent> uGoMobi: I was wondering...
[01:18:59] <frequent> uGoMobi: why does addFirstLastClasses have to run on pre-enhanced widgets?
[01:19:19] <frequent> uGoMobi: I take great pride in adding ui-first/last-child myself :-)
[01:19:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: good question
[01:19:27] <frequent> only to see JQM removing it again!
[01:19:47] <frequent> = add it to the wrong element :-)
[01:19:54] <uGoMobi> frequent: we use it in controlgroup and listview, right?
[01:20:00] <frequent> yup
[01:20:07] <frequent> but it runs a lot...
[01:20:30] <frequent> in my case I had a controlgroup with a link and submit
[01:21:01] <frequent> and JQM rmeoves  ui-last-child from the submit button... 
[01:21:07] <frequent> all pre-enhanced
[01:21:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: 1sec
[01:21:30] <uGoMobi> hmm weird
[01:21:56] <uGoMobi> frequent: sure
[01:22:33] <frequent> uGoMobi: let me check and ping back with hopefully an example
[01:23:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok, thanks
[01:27:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1355/edit
[01:28:51] <frequent> uGoMobi: $visibles includes the input as last element, so instead of the wrapper, the input gets ui-last-child
[01:29:22] * uGoMobi is looking
[01:30:16] <frequent> uGoMobi: unless my pre-enhanced code is wrong
[01:32:12] <frequent> uGoMobi: my bad. the input gets button classes...
[01:32:21] <frequent> :-(
[01:32:25] <frequent> sorry
[01:33:02] <uGoMobi> frequent: right, it's the markup
[01:33:08] <uGoMobi> frequent: no problem
[01:33:32] <frequent> uGoMobi: so should addFirstLast run in the first place on pre-enhanced widgets?
[01:33:45] <frequent> uGoMobi: I can file an issue, so its logged
[01:34:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: I was about to say that we should still look into that
[01:34:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping
[01:34:15] <frequent> ok. nice.
[01:34:32] <uGoMobi> frequent: I would say it shouldn't run
[01:34:32] <frequent> (because it runs a lot...)
[01:35:14] <uGoMobi> frequent: does it? should only run once if you ask me
[01:35:27] <uGoMobi> each time refresh method is called
[01:35:57] <frequent> uGoMobi: it runs once on the element ok, but on my page, which is not so element heavy, I'm looking at... 80x
[01:36:08] <frequent> let me commit with a console
[01:36:11] <frequent> 1sec
[01:36:14] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:41:45] <frequent> uGoMobi: http://bit.ly/1rA5Gvw
[01:42:06] <frequent> uGoMobi: check console
[01:43:16] <frequent> uGoMobi: all content is pre-enhanced, so that's .... 94x addFirstLast which I would skip if I could :-)
[01:44:15] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah I see it
[01:44:40] <uGoMobi> just don't understand it yet
[01:45:23] <frequent> uGoMobi: I'm not ruling out me being the culprit, but I'm not calling it manually
[01:45:42] <uGoMobi> it should be called once for each controlgroup or listview
[01:47:49] <frequent> uGoMobi: agree. let me check enhanceWithin... I'm suspecting.
[01:50:33] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. reasonable amount now.
[01:50:37] <frequent> 10x
[01:51:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes, that looks correct
[01:51:15] <frequent> uGoMobi: nice what missing corners can lead to :-)
[01:51:29] <uGoMobi> exactly :)
[01:53:04] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. thx so far. If _|Nix|_ chips in, I'm happy to argue for not running addFirstLast on pre-enhance :-)
[01:53:58] <uGoMobi> frequent: can you open a ticket for it?
[01:54:07] <frequent> uGoMobi: writing...
[01:54:46] <uGoMobi> frequent: I'll set milestone 1.5
[01:54:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 
[01:55:20] <uGoMobi> we will also review listview for 1.5 (add enhanced option) and it should be consistent
[01:55:22] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[01:55:37] <_|Nix|_> ps
[01:55:44] <uGoMobi> ?
[01:55:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[01:56:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The intention was to ps 
[01:57:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: frequent and I were talking about whether addFirstLastClasses should be called in case of pre-enhanced controlgroups
[01:57:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry - wireless card has bad drivers.

[01:57:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Good point. For performance reasons it shouldn't be.
[01:57:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: np
[01:57:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree
[01:58:03] <_|Nix|_> Good call!
[01:58:11] <uGoMobi> yeah
[01:58:40] <uGoMobi> it's part of enhancement so I say we shouldn't call it
[01:58:48] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks for the ticket
[01:58:50] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Only on refresh.
[01:58:59] <frequent> uGoMobi: welcome
[01:59:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[02:00:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually we do call it only on refresh, but we call refresh from create
[02:00:33] <_|Nix|_> Aha. OK.
[02:00:36] <_|Nix|_> I can take that ticket.
[02:00:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks!

[05:00:22] <arschmitz> frequent: Ping!
[05:15:54] <frequent> arschmitz: late pong!
[05:32:03] <arschmitz> frequent: still here sorry ran my son to daycare?
[05:32:17] <frequent> arschmitz: np. I was swimming :-)
[05:34:33] <arschmitz> frequent: about first last classes
[05:34:35] <frequent> yup
[05:34:35] <arschmitz> while we should not do it in case of pre-enhancment it should not make any real perf impact
[05:34:36] <arschmitz> frequent: jquery core checks if a call to add or remove class will actually change anything and it does not do it if it wont
[05:34:39] <frequent> arschmitz: true, I think this is only marginal.
[05:34:39] <frequent> arschmitz: interesting. didn't know.
[05:34:43] <arschmitz> yup it has not always been that way not sure which version it changed in it was fairly recent i think 
[05:34:44] <arschmitz> frequent: found out that even if it does not change anything if you set the prop it will cause a reflow
[05:34:45] <arschmitz> so now it checks first and wont do it 
[05:34:50] <frequent> good to know. thanks!
[05:35:10] <arschmitz> frequent: i exploit this with widgets a lot that dont support pre-enhancment
[05:35:41] <arschmitz> i add the classes anyway knowing that it will check first
[05:35:45] <frequent> hm... thinking now of my own means of exploitation :-)
[05:35:47] <frequent> exact
[05:37:37] <arschmitz> frequent: thats one of the tips i give in my talk on mobile performance i give a lot
[05:38:02] <frequent> really good to know.
[05:38:34] <arschmitz> frequent: http://presentations.uglymongrel.com/mobile-performance/ slides for my talk might be a few other helpful things in there
[05:39:00] <frequent> arschmitz: nice. thx.
[05:51:26] <frequent> arschmitz: some useful things. Curious: if I pre-enhance I don't have to add data-attributes to the markup anymore, do I? So a controlgroup does not need data-role/data-type/etc if I never intend to change it.
[05:51:44] <frequent> so it will skip creating the widget altogether.
[05:52:03] <rxaviers> Team, scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, gseguin, arschmitz, kborchers, _|Nix|_, tj, mike, I would very much appreciate your feedback and thoughts
[05:52:04] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/207
[05:52:34] <rxaviers> uGoMobi ^
[06:08:42] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah. If you intend to change the value of a widget option at runtime, and its initial value is not the default at load time, then you must specify it in your markup, even if your markup is pre-enhanced. Otherwise, you can skip it.
[06:24:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or if you just call the widget directly
[06:25:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: frequent: i actually proxy _getCreateOptions in my own stuff to not read data-attributes at all
[06:26:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: frequent: and disable auto enhancment for everything execpt pages and call all the widgets with the options i need directly in my js 
[06:37:41] <frequent> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: ok. thanks. So I can drop a lot of needless data-attributes, which I'm currently generating :-) 
[06:38:17] <arschmitz> frequent: another thing i do is use only the css for a lot of widgets
[06:38:34] <arschmitz> frequent: ie controlgroup toolbars listviews
[06:40:21] <arschmitz> frequent: then you wont ever call firstLastClasses
[06:40:41] <frequent> arschmitz: true
[06:40:57] <frequent> arschmitz: actually I'm trying to build the whole page including enhanced widgets in memory from JSON config file(s) and only make 1 dump on the page, once everything is done. Works quite nicely.
[06:40:58] <arschmitz> those are not actually dynamic widgets unless you call a method
[06:41:02] <arschmitz> they have no event handlers
[06:41:42] <frequent> arschmitz: the only method I really ever call is on a table to refresh when paginating.
[06:42:05] <frequent> arschmitz: aside from things being called internally
[06:42:12] <arschmitz> frequent: yeah there is nothing wrong with having some js its just not needed for those widgets
[06:42:50] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. nice.
[06:43:12] <arschmitz> frequent: only problem is you need to build it or modify the files your self
[06:43:20] <arschmitz> there is no builder option for css only
[06:44:03] <frequent> arschmitz: I can build most widgets pre-enhanced - have not had the time to do all
[06:44:55] <arschmitz> frequent: there is a ton of performance optimization you can do with jqm
[06:45:12] <arschmitz> it just sacrifices convenience 
[06:50:16] <frequent> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/frequent/11400835
[06:50:58] <frequent> arschmitz: generates an application wrapper with external header, footer, panels - still convenient :-)
[06:51:07] <arschmitz> frequent: cool for mobile unless it needs to work off line i prefer to send prerendered markup from the server 
[06:51:22] <frequent> arschmitz: works offline.
[06:51:49] <arschmitz> frequent: yeah thats the one time i think client side mvc on mobile makes sense is when it needs to work offline
[06:52:05] <frequent> arschmitz: I'm only using configuration files like this and they are served from remote storage or localhost
[06:52:23] <arschmitz> frequent: cool
[06:53:03] <frequent> arschmitz: still buggy for some widgets, but I think it's actually easier to handle, because I only have one file for eg controlgroup and if the API ever changes, I only need to edit this file.
[06:53:23] <arschmitz> frequent: i do the same just serverside
[06:53:41] <frequent> arschmitz: :-)
[06:54:23] <arschmitz> frequent: that slide show was done that way 
[06:54:51] <frequent> arschmitz: really like it. Nice way of making a presentation
[06:55:20] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, (cc Krinkle): On Globalize, we can use https://github.com/santhoshtr/CLDRPluralRuleParser/ as the CLDR plural engine. We, technically, can embed it in our end distribution files, so it's not made an extra dependency for users. Do you think we should not do it for legal purposes? santhoshtr's library has no license file.
[06:55:29] <arschmitz> frequent: if you were watching it live and checked the follow icon in the bottom it will follow the slideshow live
[06:56:00] <arschmitz> frequent: and it has all different control modes to like use an ipad or iphone to control it like a remote 
[06:56:45] <frequent> arschmitz: oh. i have to check that again.
[06:57:04] <arschmitz> frequent: most of that you cant see 
[06:57:14] <frequent> :-(
[06:57:23] <arschmitz> frequent: because its a presenter mode
[06:57:37] <arschmitz> frequent: you could clone the repo and set it up your self and try it though
[06:57:38] <frequent> ok
[06:57:54] <frequent> ah. would be interested. Do you have a URL?
[06:57:59] <arschmitz> its just 2 config files
[06:58:31] <arschmitz> frequent: https://github.com/arschmitz/mobile-presenter
[06:58:57] <arschmitz> have not really gotten around to docs yet because they are going on my new site
[07:00:06] <frequent> arschmitz: np. I will browse around. Thanks!
[07:02:17] <arschmitz> frequent: https://github.com/arschmitz/mobile-presenter/tree/master/application/views/mobile-performance
[07:02:24] <arschmitz> shows the markup for individual slides
[07:04:03] <frequent> arschmitz: (looking at a listview) talk about abstracting away ...
[07:04:35] <arschmitz> yeah well its for making slides so they are very simple
[07:05:04] <arschmitz> the idea is to be able to write your slides as easily as possible and not worry about all the markup
[07:05:23] <arschmitz> but it gives you the freedom to still write whatever you want if you choose 
[07:06:31] <arschmitz> frequent: https://github.com/arschmitz/mobile-presenter/blob/master/application/helpers/presentation_tools_helper.php
[07:06:58] <arschmitz> frequent: you can also pass options to each list item
[07:07:03] <arschmitz> to add links images etc
[07:08:10] <frequent> arschmitz: tidy... not like mine... :-D
[07:09:29] <arschmitz> frequent: its pretty simple just a slide deck
[07:09:39] <arschmitz> with some features
[07:10:58] <frequent> arschmitz: yup. I think I'm supporting all JQM options, plus some custom stuff (split-radio/checkbox), but nice to see the same concept.
[07:12:06] <arschmitz> im supporting only what im actually using 
[07:12:58] <frequent> same here.
[07:13:12] <arschmitz> frequent: this is supposed to be an example of the best practices i talk about in those slides so its minimalist and specific to the project
[07:13:37] <arschmitz> because thats what i recommend
[07:14:30] <frequent> arschmitz: true, I actually never used the custom builder, so I always carry excess stuff. will try next app I'm doing
[07:14:59] <arschmitz> frequent: i start with a custom build and then remove more and have a custom build
[07:15:13] <arschmitz> done in grunt
[07:19:25] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, (cc Krinkle), correction... source code has a comment with  Copyright 2012-2013 GPLV3+
[07:19:28] <frequent> arschmitz: good. I will have a look at custom builds asap then. Now off to remove some data-attributes. Thanks for all the input.
[07:21:23] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I can't answer that question, Scott is away this week
[07:21:39] <rxaviers> ah!
[07:21:50] <rxaviers> well no hurries

[07:48:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Should we remove https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/6e7f18571f64c8fc790b52fed6ad05fd2de7d0c6/bower.json#L11 to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7296?
[07:48:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It seems people are trying to build jQM after they've checked it out with bower.
[07:48:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was just reading
[07:48:44] <arschmitz> not supported
[07:49:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I don't get why they don't just git clone ... *shrug*
[07:49:15] <arschmitz> our bower.json is for our dependencies not for cloning with bower
[07:49:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see.
[07:49:40] <arschmitz> but it should still work
[07:49:48] <arschmitz> because we seperate deps and dev deps
[07:50:01] <arschmitz> but your cant use it for developemtn
[07:50:11] <_|Nix|_> That's it I think.
[07:50:15] <arschmitz> ie running tests
[07:50:42] <arschmitz> otherwise when people got it for production
[07:50:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can see how people might wanna build the library after they've checked it out via bower though.
[07:50:51] <arschmitz> they would have all the tests and demos and stuff
[07:51:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: which they can
[07:51:17] <arschmitz> with require or somethin like that
[07:51:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, they can't, because they don't get build/tasks
[07:51:26] <_|Nix|_> Oh, like that.
[07:51:27] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[07:51:35] <_|Nix|_> ... but not with grunt.
[07:51:41] <arschmitz> build is for development 
[07:52:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the assumption is if your going to use bower
[07:52:35] <arschmitz> that you will have your own custom build process already
[07:52:56] <arschmitz> likely using require or something similar
[07:53:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that might be a good argument. Grab it via bower, sure, but don't use our build. Use yours.
[07:54:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ui is the same https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/bower.json
[07:56:42] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, basically I can close it, commenting that we use bower.json as a tool for our own purposes, rather than for publishing a buildable version.
[07:56:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right?
[07:57:17] <arschmitz> not exactly
[07:57:36] <arschmitz> i mis spoke when i said not supported
[07:57:49] <arschmitz> we support cloning the lib with bower and using it
[07:57:57] <arschmitz> just not any of the build demos tests
[07:58:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. That's what I understood. You can do with our repo what our repo does with core and with UI, but no more.
[07:58:41] <arschmitz> right
[07:58:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll comment and close.

[14:40:34] <gseguin> uGoMobi: astonishing, isn't it? ;)
[14:40:51] <uGoMobi> gseguin: very :/
[14:40:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: i just commented again
[14:41:21] <gseguin> arschmitz: saw it.
[14:42:05] <arschmitz> i wish i could close an issue to further comments in github lol 
[14:42:25] <gseguin> arschmitz: if anything we should also point him at semver
[14:42:42] <gseguin> arschmitz: minor version changed, expect API to change
[14:43:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: we currently dont considder markup api in mobile so it does not even apply :| though that will change in the future
[14:53:56] <agcolom> Hi :-) I think we have a DBR candidate.
[14:59:56] <arschmitz> ag
[15:00:11] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah goes good with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7345
[15:00:16] <arschmitz> same person
[15:02:11] <gseguin> heh :)
[15:03:09] <gseguin> ok so how about writing a quick plugin that extends the button widget and has a setText method?
[15:06:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: this is not even about the button widget
[15:06:32] <arschmitz> he is explictly saying link based buttons
[15:06:35] <gseguin> true 
[15:06:42] <arschmitz> which are not even a widget they are just css on an element 
[15:06:48] <gseguin> yep
[15:07:07] <gseguin> I'm trying to make the guy happy
[15:07:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: pretty sure thats not possible
[15:07:37] <gseguin> he wants an API (different than jQuery's) to change his anchor title
[15:07:45] <gseguin> let's give him one
[15:08:00] * gseguin is joking
[15:14:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: uGoMobi: maybe that comment will make him leave us alone

[18:24:32] <_zoggy_> fyi, on jqueryui.com/download switching the option from legacy to stable you can see that the 'button' label text changes..
[18:24:45] <_zoggy_> 1.10.4 - Enhances a form with themeable buttons
[18:24:56] <_zoggy_> 1.9.2 - Enhances a form with themable buttons.
[18:25:21] <_zoggy_> 1.9.2's is missing the 'e' in themeable
