[06:55:55] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[06:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> While I've got you: http://cl.ly/image/0L3s0e3D3J3o
[06:56:18] <kswedberg> hey, I'm looking at the new animation stuff at https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475f
[06:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..that 404s for me.
[06:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I got it, removing the last character works :-P
[06:57:18] <kswedberg> weird.
[06:57:30] <kswedberg> anyway … I like that signature style
[06:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:58:17] <kswedberg> except not crazy about "Object request, Function response(Object data))"
[06:58:57] <kswedberg> hard to mentally parse.
[06:59:38] <kswedberg> but can't think of a better way.
[06:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, nobody could :-P
[07:00:31] <kswedberg> heh. are request and response required? if not, should we designate them as optional? with brackets?
[07:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> No, they're not optional, they get passed to the function.
[07:01:32] <kswedberg> oh right. ok.
[07:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> The source option can be a function, that function will receive two parameters.
[07:02:02] <kswedberg> ok. so, back to my question about animate
[07:02:13] <kswedberg> we have an options-argument.xml include
[07:02:55] <kswedberg> but as of 1.8 we have a few more properties available in the options object.
[07:03:29] <kswedberg> so should we have another signature in .animate() (and other effects methods) and have an options-argument-1.8.xml file?
[07:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> You can just put added="1.8" on the new <property> elements.
[07:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> It'll append "(added 1.8)" to the description.
[07:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> If the signature itself hasn't changed, it'd probably be confusing to have two sigantures that look the same, but have a few additional options in one.
[07:05:48] <kswedberg> k. that makes sense.
[07:06:05] <kswedberg> oh right. like you did with specialEasing. got it
[07:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> This follows what you were doing manually with methods like jQuery.ajax().
[07:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yeah, it's already on specialEasing :-)
[07:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty much everything supports @added, @deprecated, @removed at this point.
[07:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're on the main entry, then I think it <added>, <deprecated>, etc. for back-compat.
[07:08:29] <kswedberg> ok. sounds good.

[07:11:35] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Changed type rendering. - Scott González
[07:13:02] <kswedberg> gnarf, scott_gonzalez: how does the new progress callback on effects compare to the step callback? when would someone use one of them rather than the other?
[07:13:26] <kswedberg> and is always pretty much the same as complete?
[07:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I'm not sure how progress works.
[07:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'd expect it to be the same as step, but the only code I can find is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L163
[07:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it runs on every tick: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L94
[07:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> So I think the difference is that step is once per tick per property.
[07:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> And progress is once per tick.
[07:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> always is different from complete because complete is not fired if you .stop() but don't goToEnd
[07:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's my understanding from reading the code just now.
[07:28:25] <gnarf> kswedberg: step is called once per property per frame
[07:28:32] <gnarf> kswedberg: it is passed the "fx" object
[07:28:46] <gnarf> kswedberg: progress is called after setting EVERY property once per frame
[07:29:19] <gnarf> in a single property animation, they would be roughly equivalent
[07:30:08] <gnarf> done is for all intensive purposes the old "complete"
[07:30:10] <kswedberg> ok, so gnarf and scott_gonzalez, you said basically the same thing, yeah?
[07:30:16] <gnarf> yes
[07:30:26] <kswedberg> *intents and purposes
[07:30:35] <gnarf> i hadn't read scott_gonzalez answer until after i wrote my own :)
[07:30:38] <kswedberg> :-p
[07:30:54] <kswedberg> gnarf: cool. just want to make sure.
[07:32:20] <kswedberg> gnarf, scott_gonzalez: and both step and progress are executed per element, right?
[07:32:23] <kswedberg> or no?
[07:32:28] <gnarf> kswedberg: yes
[07:32:54] <kswedberg> great. thanks.
[07:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> running an errand, back in a bit
[08:45:50] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: rxaviers is asking about the difference between grunt output, e.g. jquery-ui.js/css and what download builder produces, e.g. development-bundle/themes/base/jquery-ui-1.9.0pre.custom.css https://gist.github.com/be28a5af6101465c961c#gistcomment-522053
[08:46:36] <jzaefferer> are we fine with having different namings between our package and the download builder? can we or do we want to make that more consistent?
[08:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> They're intentionally different.
[08:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> The grunt build goes to CDNs, where the versions are in directories.
[08:48:57] <scott_gonzalez> The download goes into someone else's code, where they (hopefully) only have one copy of jQuery UI.
[08:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> We've gotten requests to not include version numbers though.
[08:50:03] <jzaefferer> Yeah, while I won't question our choice to include a versioned jQuery file in our own repo anymore, I tend to prefer file names without versions, too
[08:50:41] <rxaviers> Doesnt it make sense to have versioned files under /js and /css. But, not in the /development-bundle/*?
[08:51:04] <jzaefferer> yeah, looking at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite
[08:51:14] <jzaefferer> we should probably just remove all versions inside the development-bundle
[08:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with that.
[08:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Does TYPO3 have a timeline?
[08:52:03] <jzaefferer> Dunno, just got that info from Felix
[08:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see, they're jumping form 4.x to 6.x
[08:53:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, ok, thanks.

[11:50:56] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: running grunt wordpress-validate I get "Error: Mismatching versions. grunt-wordpress: 1.0.3; XML-RPC version: 1.0.2"
[11:51:04] <kswedberg> ideas?
[12:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: You need to `git pull` web-base-tempalte
[12:29:58] <kswedberg> ah
[12:30:05] <kswedberg> thx. :)
[12:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> That error message was telling you that your repo's grunt-wordpress was at v1.0.3, but the WordPress install that it's talking to via XML-RPC was on v1.0.2.
[12:32:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be happy to update the error message if you have ideas for improving it.
