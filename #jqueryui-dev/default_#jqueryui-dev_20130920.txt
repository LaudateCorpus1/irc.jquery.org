[06:46:32] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll1: could you fill out the list of options on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137778/Datepicker ? Continue what you started with the altField and altFormat options. I've filled in a few myself, based on what I found while updating the demos
[06:47:02] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll1: once we've got that done, I'd like to get together with Scott and Alex to discuss the API and make some descisions
[06:48:21] <tj_vantoll1> jzaefferer: Yeah will do after the widget extension stuff lands.
[06:49:53] <MPer> did sortable toArray change since earlier versions? it seems I get an array of elements back instead of strings

[07:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone heard about <input type="datetime"> being deprecated?
[07:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios7-html5-problems-apis-review
[07:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> I hadn't heard of this.
[07:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> I can't find anything on Google indicating this.
[07:08:39] <scott_gonzalez> And it's still in both the WHATWG and W3C spec.
[07:42:37] <jzaefferer> I haven't, only saw it mentioned in that blog post
[07:43:16] <jzaefferer> hey arschmitz, wanna rewrite jQuery UI's button widget?
[07:43:29] <jzaefferer> (that's a loaded question)
[07:49:38] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: Apple dropped support for input type="datetime" in iOS7, but it is still in the W3C spec
[07:51:14] <uGoMobi> this is based on people running html5test.com with iOS7 Safari
[07:51:27] <uGoMobi> don't see anything in Apple's documentation
[08:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: What do you think about adding a complete() method to progressbar in the intro article for widget factory?
[08:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> That would give you a sane method to proxy in the extensions article.
[08:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> Without relying on an actual UI widget.
[08:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> We can stay with dialog if you think it's better, I just like having articles build on each other.
[08:03:11] <tj_vantoll1> I think it would be better if the method were one that's actually in the widget. What I could do though is start with progressbar and transition to dialog, so the flow is better.
[08:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it would actually be in the widget in the intro article.
[08:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> The point is that we're showing the widget factory outside of UI.
[08:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> We could also rewrite the intro article to not use progressbar.
[08:04:52] <tj_vantoll1> Oh I see now.
[08:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> And use color boxes.
[08:05:19] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah add a quick method and say to learn more about extendingâ€¦ [link]
[08:05:47] <tj_vantoll1> I missed the part where you were referring to the intro article and not the extension one.
[08:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[08:06:40] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah I think that makes sense. I'll take a look and add changes to that article to my pull request.
[08:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to wrap up the API docs changes, push them to a branch and leave a comment on the learn PR so that we make sure to land the API updates as soon as the learn article is live.
[08:11:08] <tj_vantoll1> Excellent.
[08:11:21] <tj_vantoll1> I'm reviewing the how to article now.
[08:11:26] <tj_vantoll1> "There is currently a limitation that exactly one namespace must be used."  ?
[08:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe remove the "currently" part.
[08:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have plant to support deep namespacing.
[08:23:38] <tj_vantoll1> So you can't do "custom.veryCustom.namespace" right?
[08:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> right
[08:24:08] <tj_vantoll1> That text makes it seem like you can't do "custom1.myWidget" and "custom2.myWidget", which is what confused me.
[08:25:02] <tj_vantoll1> "You can only create namespaces that are one level deep, therefore, "custom.progressbar" is a valid namespace whereas "very.custom.progressbar" is not."
[08:25:43] <tj_vantoll1> Also the how to article already has a "Extending a Plugin's Prototype" section. I'll probably just add a sentence with a link there.
[08:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds good.
[08:31:54] <tj_vantoll1> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/tjvantoll/learn.jquery.com/commit/7435684a347eab9bc818ce7f47984560d1821852#L0R248

[08:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[08:35:43] <tj_vantoll1> Alright with the learn stuff landing or did you still want to take another look?
[08:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> The new article?
[08:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> Or this update?
[08:38:26] <tj_vantoll1> Either
[08:38:43] <tj_vantoll1> They're on the same branch so both.

[09:04:14] <tj_vantoll1> no worries or rush
[09:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: So we're staying with dialog in the extension article?
[09:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> If yes, I'll do my final review now. If not, I'll wait for the update.
[09:13:34] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah I think so.

[10:14:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, checking
[10:17:43] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I have cloned a brand new downloadbuilder and `npm install && grunt prepare`
[10:17:46] <rxaviers> it worked just fine
[10:17:58] <rxaviers> so, perhaps try `rm -Rf tmp`
[10:18:03] <rxaviers> have you changed config.json?
[10:51:18] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: will check those suggestions, thanks
[10:51:31] <rxaviers> ywc let me know in trouble
[10:53:27] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what should I look for in my config.json?
[10:54:46] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: no, I haven't changed config.json (now I've actually read your comment)
[10:54:47] <rxaviers> have you changed config.json to use a different UI?
[10:54:56] <rxaviers> ah ok
[10:54:56] <rxaviers> ;)
[10:55:06] <rxaviers> did delete tmp work?
[11:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: What's being released on Monday?
[11:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> Beta or Final?
[11:14:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think it's beta: http://meetings.jquery.org/category/mobile/ 
[11:15:45] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you normally release the api doc on a final release or do you do that for beta releases?
[11:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> final
[11:16:33] <agcolom> uGoMobi: how do you feel about releasing api.jquerymobile.com/1.4/ on final? 
[11:17:14] <scott_gonzalez>  It's not /1.4/, it's just api.jquerymobile.com
[11:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> The new site would be api.jquerymobile.com/1.3/ (which is what's currently on api.jquerymobile.com)
[11:17:36] <agcolom> oh, yes, you're right. it will be 1.3
[11:35:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so do we need to talk about the update of the api docs site for mobile, or do you need to speak with Corey first?
[11:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's nothing to do until the final release.
[11:35:15] <agcolom> (release I mean)
[11:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm going to talk to Corey about the discussion we had in Austin.
[11:35:32] <agcolom> right, ok, so the discussion can take place sometime next week then
[11:35:38] <agcolom> ?
[11:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:36:30] <agcolom> ok then. 
[11:37:01] <agcolom> any day works best for you?
[12:08:22] <Kory> Hey, guys I think I have found an issue with the jquery dialog on Firefox, just wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar
[12:09:11] <Kory> I have a Wysiwyg editor in the dialog that uses an iframe, in firefox switching between the iframe and the main document causes focus to jump to the first input in the dialog
[12:09:54] <Kory> This happens when I click a button outside of the iframe but within the dialog, and causes a chosen dropdown to open on me :S
[12:10:39] <sheppard> arschmitz: changed my name
[12:11:18] <sheppard> hopefully reduces confusion
[12:14:24] <Kory> nobody around?
[12:19:13] <tj_vantoll> Kory: see http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9087
[12:21:07] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: "The wording makes it sound like you can't call methods that haven't been redefined on the new widget."
[12:21:07] <tj_vantoll> Well, unless you redefine it you can only get to it through $.ui.dialog.prototype.open though.
[12:21:31] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: agcolom : I was hoping we could already show API docs with 1.4 beta release
[12:22:07] <uGoMobi> but if we can't make it in time we have to wait until final
[12:22:56] <uGoMobi> it's was just because it makes it easier for people to test the beta
[12:27:52] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Anyways, I know you're busy. I commented on the GitHub issue. Let me know if you have any other concerns.
[12:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Looks good now.
[12:31:59] <scott_gonzalez> Go ahead an land that.
[12:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> And tag so it deploys.
[12:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: I'm going to talk with gnarf about this next week.
[12:33:01] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok great, thanks

[12:42:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[12:42:23] <scott_gonzalez> npm version patch will update the package.json and do the tag for you.
[12:42:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you want me to deprecate the options Alex lists in that doc?
[12:42:50] <tj_vantoll> Ok so,
[12:42:50] <tj_vantoll> $ npm version patch
[12:42:50] <tj_vantoll> $ git push origin â€”tags
[12:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> `git push origin --tags` will push the commits and the tag?
[12:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> If so, that's fine.
[12:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> I always `git push && git push --tags`, but if specifying an origin combines them, then go for it :-)
[12:45:47] <tj_vantoll> Well actually I have "origin" setup for my fork and "upstream" for the main repo.
[12:46:08] <tj_vantoll> git push upstream â€”tags seems to have done it

[12:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that statement is true.
[12:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't manually tag.
[12:47:48] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.
[12:47:59] <tj_vantoll> Just wondering where if anywhere that should be documented. Is it somewhere?
[12:48:19] <tj_vantoll> Just so the process doesn't involve pinging scott_gonzalez :)
[12:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we have an active disucssion about this right now on the mailing list.
[12:49:41] <tj_vantoll> Yeah true.
[12:49:44] <tj_vantoll> ok
[12:50:37] <tj_vantoll> Contribute seems a decent place for this. There's already a "Deploying to Staging and Production Environments" heading that seems appropriate.
[12:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, good point.

[13:07:02] <Kory> @tj_vantoll: I already submitted a PR to the SCEditor I am using to paritally fix this. However, it is still an issue in Firefox that when the iframe that is a child of the dialog loses focus, the focusin event is triggered with document as the target. document is not under the dialog so it then focuses the first element
