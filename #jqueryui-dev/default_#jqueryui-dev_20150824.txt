[11:57:12] <arschmitz> m_gol: Hey sorry i missed your ping spelled my name wrong :-)
[11:57:30] <m_gol> arschmitz: haha, indeed
[11:57:57] <m_gol> arschmitz: QUnit has switched away from TestSwarm & I'm removing their config. Can I remove one for Mobile as well since you've never used it?
[11:58:10] <arschmitz> yup
[11:58:30] <arschmitz> we are working on switching to intern for cross browser testing
[11:58:45] <arschmitz> m_gol: so we will never use testswarm at this point 
[12:03:23] <m_gol> k, thx
