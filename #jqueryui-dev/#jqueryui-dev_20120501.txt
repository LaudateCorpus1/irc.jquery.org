[04:55:32] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Grunt: Update to testswarm@0.2.1, fixes timeout handling - Jörn Zaefferer
[05:01:24] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Im amending my PR now to fix the issue you mentioned
[05:01:30] <Krinkle> node-testswarm
[05:06:39] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: hm.. testswarm 0.2.1 doesn't exist yet?
[05:06:59] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Im amending my node-testswarm PR now to fix the issue you mentioned
[05:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle, jzaefferer: What's the issue in node-testswarm?
[05:17:59] <Krinkle> No issue, just feedback on my PR

[05:18:06] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on node-testswarm by Krinkle (19h, 4m ago): updates
[05:20:22] <Krinkle> ahm.. anyone got some magic wand I can borrow? I'm clueless here. I got a local testswarm install and when I access it through localhost I can login fine. But when I access it by external IP-address (I forwarded the port), everything looks good but the login fails.
[05:20:30] <Krinkle> does it ring any bells for anyone?
[05:21:29] <Krinkle> oh great, got it. Chrome is being a bitch and forcing the wrong password with its AutoFill
[05:22:04] <Krinkle> I've had that before, if the username in autofill is wrong, but looks the same when trimmed/case-insensitive matched, then it overrules and pretends it is the same
[05:22:49] <Krinkle> so if it has a memory of 'MediaWiki:1234' and I type 'mediawiki' and 'foobar' it will autocorrect
[05:22:49] <Krinkle> argh!

[07:39:39] <jzaefferer> sorry Krinkle, I published npm, but didn't push to GitHub
[07:39:47] <Krinkle> aha
[07:40:00] <Krinkle> oh, i fear my pr
[07:40:12] <Krinkle>  many changes?
[07:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Oh, I was thinking of node-browserstack when you said node-testswarm. Too many projects :-P Nevermind...
[07:58:02] <Krinkle> hehe
[08:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> koopersmith: Taxonomies will need to be generated ahead of time, directly in WP, correct?
[08:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we can just define them in PHP inside web-base-template?
[08:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> Then we'll control the terms from our content repos.
[08:38:41] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, looks like it. Surprised we don't have a newTaxonomy XMLRPC method.
[08:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually ok with this. It'd require even more code to support generating the taxonomies on our end :-P
[08:40:03] <scott_gonzalez> Taxonomies shouldn't really be changing, so I'm ok with that not being supported in our content deployment.
[08:40:39] <koopersmith> Yep, exactly.
[12:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: WP is making me sad :-(
[12:46:25] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: how can I make your day better?
[12:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> If I create a child category named "foo", then I create a post with: terms_names: { category: [ "foo" ] }
[12:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> It makes foo a top level category
[12:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> sort of
[12:47:30] <nacin> does it make foo a top-level category in just the admin?
[12:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> It shows up as a child in the Categories page, but as a top level in the Post Edit page.
[12:47:45] <nacin> okay. then it is not actually making foo a top-level category.
[12:47:58] <nacin> this is a very interesting quirk of our UI. you're seeing intentional behavior, believe it or not.
[12:48:10] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[12:48:35] <nacin> core visually floats checked categories to the top of the box. otherwise, if you had a hundred categories, you would have no idea what is checked.
[12:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let me dig into the problem that Richard's having then.
[12:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> His doesn't even show up as a child in the Categories page.
[12:50:47] <nacin> if his was added through XML-RPC initially, that could explain it. it was created as a parent, in that case.
[12:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> That's what my reduced test case did too though.
[12:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> They both ran through grunt-wordpress to generate the categories.
[12:52:20] <nacin> yours shows up as a child on the categories page, no?
[12:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[12:53:17] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I just finished running with Richard's example and it worked properly for me.
[13:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> OMG. Totally Richard's fault.
[13:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> His taxonomies.json file was misnamed.
[13:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to ban rworth from pairing. He STILL doesn't have a valid .json file...
[13:13:04] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: hah. good to know it's rworth, not WP, making you sad.
[13:13:33] <rworth> better was after I renamed the file and forgot it was still open in my editor with the old name
[13:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Why would a taxonomy have an empty name?
[13:21:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it shouldn't
[13:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> rworth has taxonomies with empty strings for names, but proper labels.
[13:22:59] <nacin> you mean terms, then.
[13:23:18] <nacin> category = taxonomy, "foo" = term
[13:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, taxonomies.
[13:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> He's going to create a gist.
[13:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/2571078
[13:24:29] <nacin> that looks like a bug. let me look. are you on HEAD?
[13:24:38] <rworth> yup
[13:25:26] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you seeing the same thing?
[13:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, but I'm a few days behind.
[13:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> I can update and reset my db.
[13:25:54] <nacin> I made a few changes over the weekend and could have broken something.
[13:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update now.
[13:26:05] <nacin> running some tests.
[13:27:50] <nacin> I can reproduce. Going to add some tests and fix.
[13:33:13] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: rworth: try HEAD (r20670)
[13:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We're pulling from the git clone.
[13:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's every half hour, right?
[13:36:48] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: okay, just manually updated github
[13:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I'm getting a bunch of notices now.
[13:42:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: such as?
[13:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> Undefined variable: taxnomy in <b>/Users/scottgonzalez/Projects/WordPress/wp-includes/class-wp-xmlrpc-server.php</b> on line <b>527<
[13:43:18] <nacin> gah, there were two mis-spellings, I only caught one.
[13:43:28] <nacin> working on unit tests now, so I'll correct it in a few.
[13:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> ah, typo
[13:43:52] <nacin> yep.
[13:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> Also line 905 checks for status, which is optional.
[13:45:56] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: a default is merged in on line 826
[13:46:17] <nacin> are you seeing a notice there, or is that just from perusing the code?
[13:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, bad name, status => post_status?
[13:46:41] <nacin> thank you sir.
[13:46:59] <nacin> these are all on me, sadly.
[13:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> Fixing taxnomy and status gets us back to working on HEAD :-)
[13:57:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yep, will handle those in a moment. going through our tests to make sure I didn't screw up anything else.
[14:06:39] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: added some more changes and tests. will be updated on Github in a bit
[14:08:15] <rworth> awesome, thanks nacin
[14:08:35] <nacin> there was a bug in our test suite preventing it from detecting things like notices.
[14:08:39] <rworth> btw, it doesn't seem like this issues queue should be turned on https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/issues
[14:08:46] <nacin> I will turn it off
[14:09:07] <nacin> if I can figure out how
[14:09:55] <rworth> https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/admin unchecked "Issues"

[14:34:41] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Too bad.. it was cutting it very close. IE6 took 20 seconds too long. If browserstack implements support for having multiple workers for 1 browser, we'll definitely make it within 15 minutes next time. Good news :)
[14:35:02] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org//job/26 all done now
[16:48:00] <rworth> Krinkle beautiful
