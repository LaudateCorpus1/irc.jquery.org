[04:38:38] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: no button update yet, right?
[04:39:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: no iv been realy sick the last two days
[04:43:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i do have a question though
[04:45:41] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: how do you feel about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1333#discussion_r20111409
[04:46:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: using prop seems like overkill to me do you know of anything inconsistent in our cupported browsers with checked?
[04:47:11] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: there was weirdness between the prop and attr in ie7 but thats fixed in 8
[05:00:47] <jzaefferer> I'd also go with .prop
[05:11:10] <arschmitz> ok
[05:33:04] <Ansikt> Hey, I'm trying to make the jQuery UI datepicker display vertically when multiple months are displayed at a time (by default, months are ordered LTR, but I'd like them ordered top->bottom).  Any ideas?
[06:12:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: do you want me to land classes or wait for scott_gonzalez?
[06:12:37] <lisa_deluca> good morning jQuery-mobile-ers :)
[06:12:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: Morning!
[06:12:51] <lisa_deluca> I'm back from a conference so incase you were wondering where I was... i'm back
[06:13:04] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: awesome how was it?
[06:13:17] <lisa_deluca> Really good. It was the Defrag conference in Colorado
[06:13:32] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: cool i spoke at jssummit yesterday
[06:13:50] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: nice, about jquery mobile?  how many attendees?
[06:13:51] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: scott_gonzalez, DaveMethvin|away, and kborchers are all at chrome dev conf
[06:14:07] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: state of mobile and ui
[06:14:15] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: i thought I saw some tweets come by about chrome dev conf
[06:14:26] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and i think jzaefferer is talking at jssummit today
[06:14:40] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: thinks its just that time of year lol
[06:14:46] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: you skipped out early? or still there multi-tasking?
[06:14:59] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: its an online conf
[06:15:11] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: how does that work for speaking? webconf?
[06:15:14] <arschmitz> http://environmentsforhumans.com/2014/javascript-summit/
[06:15:22] <arschmitz> webcam
[06:15:26] <arschmitz> and screen share
[06:15:51] <arschmitz> it uses adobe connect which has like built in chat and handles multiple videos feeds and stuff
[06:16:15] <arschmitz> aside from a technical issue with safari it went smooth for me
[06:20:33] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: want to see something cool?
[06:20:46] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://jsbin.com/hasike/2#two-one
[06:21:05] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: sorry http://jsbin.com/hasike/2
[06:21:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: thats 2 separately navigable pagecontainers for tablet layouts
[06:21:39] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: that is pretty cool.  
[06:22:02] <lisa_deluca> i can see that being useful for portal type of pages, dashboards
[06:22:03] <arschmitz> does not work with backbutton since we dont officially support this yet
[06:22:11] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: email apps
[06:22:20] <arschmitz> file system navigators
[06:22:34] <lisa_deluca> how is the responsive design, what happens? let me look
[06:22:53] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: it does not do anything right now
[06:23:11] <arschmitz> its just two containers positioned absolute 50% width
[06:25:06] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: its just to show its actually possible to even do it
[06:25:24] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: we have taken steps to make it possible but never have actually tried to do it
[06:26:16] <lisa_deluca> It's pretty cool.  it'd be neat for responsive if the first "panel" was above the second.  not sure what the "correct" way to do it is
[06:26:32] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: oh that would be easy
[06:26:42] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: the containers are just divs
[06:26:54] <arschmitz> you can position them however you like and use media queries 
[06:27:07] <arschmitz> anything you can do with a div you can do with the panels
[06:27:51] <sfrisk> Ooo, nice
[06:28:25] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: markup looks pretty cool.  easy.  so they are basically just panels surrounded by an outter div to say where they should be? 
[06:28:29] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yeah its something on our roadmap to support tablet layouts with however many page containers you want 
[06:28:42] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: nope they are just divs in the body
[06:28:53] <arschmitz> normally in jqm the body is the pagecontainer
[06:29:02] <arschmitz> this is just defineing 2 pagecontainers 
[06:29:08] <arschmitz> both of them are children of the body
[06:29:13] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: yea, that's what i meant, not sure why i'm calling them panels
[06:29:33] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: it makes sense when you look at them to think of them as panels
[06:29:33] <lisa_deluca> just seeing <div id="second"> wrapping.  easy enough
[06:29:51] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://jsbin.com/hasike/2/edit
[06:29:58] <arschmitz> maybe that makes it easier to see whats going on
[06:30:28] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: jqm if the first data-role=page it finds just picks the parent as the pagecontainer
[06:30:37] <arschmitz> so in this case one-one is the first page
[06:30:44] <arschmitz> and its parent is #first
[06:30:51] <arschmitz> so that one is created on init
[06:31:18] <arschmitz> #second i create on documentready by calling pagecontainer() on it
[06:31:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: wait a bit for Scott
[06:31:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure
[06:31:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i thought thats what we had decided
[06:31:52] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: but then based on your pr comment i was not sure
[06:32:17] <jzaefferer> yeah, forgot about that
[06:32:24] <jzaefferer> just wanted to confirm that I got nothing to complain about
[06:32:35] <jzaefferer> Since my last comment mentioned the demos
[06:32:35] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sure thats why i was checking
[06:36:50] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: i tried throwing on a 3rd page for kicks and it doesn't display anything.  so i'm assuming it's limited to just two arschmitz
[06:37:13] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: it should work but you would have to set up the js calls to init it
[06:42:23] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/rebecisene/1/ (don't worry about looking at this if you have other things you're working on, just thought Id play)
[06:43:19] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you need to add some css to position it
[06:47:20] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://jsbin.com/xeqop#three-one
[06:47:24] <arschmitz> oops
[06:47:27] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/xeqop
[06:58:06] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: awesome!  btw, what other common templates besides persistant nav and multiple page layouts are common for jquery mobile users? any more thought to my npm cordova module? 
[07:01:12] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: did you get an answer about puting in your own github?
[07:01:53] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: a common shared panel i would say is very common
[07:10:12] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: can you link me?  not yet... we're trying to track down the right people to help us
[07:10:25] <arschmitz> ok
[07:10:49] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/panel-external/
[07:12:01] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: awesome, gracias

[07:15:38] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://www.jqmgallery.com/
[07:15:46] <arschmitz> might give you some more inspiration 
[07:22:25] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: who owns the jqmgallery page?  
[07:23:06] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i actually have no ida
[07:23:17] <arschmitz> its been around since jqm started
[07:23:39] <lisa_deluca> built by Dan Tavelli
[07:23:54] <arschmitz> dont know him
[07:24:26] <arschmitz> i dont even know if its still maintained its on 1.3.2

[11:37:51] <lisa_deluca> hey jquery question for jinz
[11:38:24] <lisa_deluca> so i want to get the html for an entire page including the opening and closing <html> tags
[11:38:34] <lisa_deluca> window.document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].innerHTML just returns the middle
[11:38:38] <lisa_deluca> is there a way to do this with jquery
[11:38:52] <lisa_deluca> i tried $('html').parent().html() but that didn't work
[11:43:42] <jasperdegroot> lisa_deluca: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/982717/how-do-i-get-the-entire-pages-html-with-jquery
[11:44:47] <cgack> lisa_deluca: i think if you swap innerHTML with outerHTML you might get it too
[11:45:16] <lisa_deluca> cgack: yup, that's what i ended up doing, that works good other than grabbing the license comment from the top of the file
[12:04:01] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: http://jsbin.com/quside/2/edit
[12:04:17] <arschmitz> that gets everything including comments and things outside the html
[12:05:23] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: does not work in that view though http://jsbin.com/quside/2 iframes mess with it
[12:05:33] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: thank you!!
[12:06:06] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: your thank you
[12:06:15] <arschmitz> your welcome lol

[12:06:37] <lisa_deluca> haha
