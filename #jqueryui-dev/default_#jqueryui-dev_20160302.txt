[06:10:20] <sonali5> hello arschmitz there ?
[10:11:34] <sathya92> Hi, I'm a third year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I'm hoping on taking part in Google summer of Code this year and i'm interested in the project jQuery Mobile - Update touch gestures to use Hammer.js.  Can you please provide me some guidelines on how to get started?
[10:17:36] <arschmitz> sathya92: have you used either jQuery Mobile or hammer.js before?
[10:45:59] <sathya92> have used hammer.js in web development previously but not JQuery mobile. I'm currently trying to get familiarized with JQuery mobile as well. I have prior experience of web development using Javascript, PHP, HTML5, CSS, JQuery and i also have contributed to web-related opensource projects like WSO2 - Process Center and WSO2 BPS
[11:52:57] <sonali5> hello arschmitz
[11:53:22] <arschmitz> hi
[11:53:56] <sonali5> Now since jquery has been selected for gsoc
[11:54:01] <arschmitz> sathya92: sounds great i think getting familiar with jquery mobile is the place to start
[11:54:09] <sonali5> i can work on that project right ?
[11:54:29] <sonali5> i looked through hammer.js
[11:54:35] <sonali5> and made a demo
[11:54:41] <arschmitz> yes
[11:54:49] <sonali5> with basic touch gestures for corousal
[11:55:00] <arschmitz> execlent
[11:55:41] <sonali5> arschmitz what should i focus on next ?
[11:57:05] <arschmitz> comparing how the touch gestures work in both hammer and jquery mobile
[11:57:20] <arschmitz> and how you will replace one with the other and how their semantic differ etc
[11:57:36] <arschmitz> it also could not hurt try to to help on bugs to get familiar with the workings of both libraies
[11:57:46] <arschmitz> try to find a bug you think you can work on and do a PR
[11:58:02] <sonali5> sure arschmitz can you let me know where the bugs are?
[11:58:19] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[11:58:49] <sonali5> sure arschmitz i would look through them
[12:00:06] <sonali5> is there any specific tags with which i should look for ?
[12:00:23] <arschmitz> no anything is fine
[12:02:26] <sonali5> arschmitz is that a good bug to start with
[12:02:43] <arschmitz> is what a good bug?
