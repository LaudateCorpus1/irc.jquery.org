[04:05:31] <Krinkle> Man someone really needs to do something about the jQuery tests. They are just too unreliable and dependent on race conditions and fail with false positives all the time
[04:05:47] <Krinkle> Maybe a reset is in order? Just nuke it all and start over.
[04:06:13] <Krinkle> Not once have I seen jQuery UI tests pass in a browser, any browser.
[04:07:20] <Krinkle> well, they pass in many browsers, but never all at once :P
[04:07:25] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2645
[07:29:52] <hadifarnoud> how can I pass the value of a checkbox to another one? like input value  $('#user-pdmr-field').val($('#user-pdmr').val());
[07:31:33] <tj_vantoll> hadifarnoud: Support is in #jquery.
[08:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Have you seen the tickets about the bad theme images?
[08:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9090
[08:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.0 correct: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/themes/redmond/images/ui-bg_flat_0_aaaaaa_40x100.png
[08:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.1 incorrect: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.1/themes/redmond/images/ui-bg_flat_0_aaaaaa_40x100.png
[08:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> Think it's a problem with IM on my laptop?
[08:32:39] <rxaviers> havent, looking
[08:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> If I download the Redmond theme from TR the image is correct.
[08:35:43] <rxaviers> so the generate_themes did it wrong then?
[08:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you review that combobox PR?
[08:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: yeah
[08:35:56] <rxaviers> ok reviewing it
[08:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the first thing to do would be to see if it generates a proper image for you.
[08:36:12] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what's the IM you have?
[08:36:19] <rxaviers> yeap
[08:36:26] <rxaviers> we can add another test..
[08:36:37] <rxaviers> convert -version
[08:36:43] <rxaviers> mine is

[08:37:40] <rxaviers> mm even newer
[08:37:52] <rxaviers> I had udpated DB to check if IM is installed and also to check if it's ImageMagick (and not GraphicsMagick)

[08:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> Features:  OpenCL
[08:38:04] <rxaviers> let me check locally
[08:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> Could be OpenMP vs. OpenCL?
[08:38:17] <rxaviers> :/
[08:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know anything about graphics.
[08:38:35] <rxaviers> openMP only makes it faster using parallel stuff
[08:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:38:46] <rxaviers> dont know about CL
[08:38:48] <rxaviers> will check
[08:51:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you get any error running this:
[08:51:50] <rxaviers> download.jqueryui.com $ convert -size 40x100 'xc:#aaa' template/themeroller/texture/flat.png -compose dissolve -define compose:args=0,100 -composite /tmp/output.png
[08:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[08:52:46] <rxaviers> what about the image. Is it blank or grey?
[08:52:54] <rxaviers> (I've just ran generate_themes locally and checked redmond images. There are ok)
[08:52:55] <scott_gonzalez> blank
[08:52:59] <rxaviers> :-/
[08:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's get someone else with OS X to try this.
[08:53:45] <rxaviers> ok.. but, that's not good anyway. You have a recent version of it.
[08:54:07] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, wanna run a test on your OS X?
[08:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Sure, but it'll at least give us some clues.
[08:54:15] <rxaviers> yeap
[08:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll kborchers mikesherov petersendidit gnarf: Any of you around to test?
[08:54:46] <kborchers> yeah, what do you need
[08:54:55] <rxaviers> that was quick
[08:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have ImageMagick installed?
[08:55:05] <kborchers> nope
[08:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have port?
[08:55:23] <kborchers> as in wine?
[08:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> MacPorts
[08:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll take that as a no :-P
[08:55:46] <kborchers> no idea so probably not
[08:55:58] <kborchers> look how helpful i am
[08:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I didn't have it either.
[08:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> But I didn't want to compile ImageMagick on my own.
[08:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.macports.org/
[08:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#macosx
[08:57:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can follow the instructions on that page or just install port and then `sudo port install ImageMagick`
[08:57:30] <kborchers> kk one minute
[08:58:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, by the way openCL seems to be used to speed things up too (OpenCL can be used to give an application access to a graphics processing unit for non-graphical computing [wikipedia])
[08:58:25] <kborchers> hmmm
[08:58:36] <kborchers> i guess i need to add port to my path since the installer doesn't
[08:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[08:58:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what did u use? port?
[08:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeha
[08:59:14] <rxaviers> k
[09:05:03] <kborchers> current status: port is downloading the ENTIRE INTERNET /cc scott_gonzalez rxaviers 
[09:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what it seemed like to me too :-P
[09:07:53] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: ngsilverman scott_gonzalez jzaefferer any of you have an idea for a cool (yet still somewhat simple) interaction demo where i could show off new draggable and/or resizable?
[09:08:27] <kborchers> specifically with either touch or xbox controller not mouse
[09:08:30] <gnarf> what version of imagemagick did you end up with scott?
[09:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ImageMagick 6.8.0-7 2013-02-15 Q16
[09:09:28] <gnarf> Version: ImageMagick 6.8.1-10 2013-01-25 Q16 http://www.imagemagick.org
[09:09:47] <gnarf> seems that the 6.8 should be fine
[09:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you checkout download.jqueryui.com and then run:
[09:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> convert -size 40x100 'xc:#aaa' template/themeroller/texture/flat.png -compose dissolve -define compose:args=0,100 -composite /tmp/output.png
[09:11:50] <gnarf> yeah i don't think that worked
[09:11:50] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/0Q2s223O3t1v
[09:12:09] <rxaviers> it worked ;)
[09:12:12] <rxaviers> grey
[09:12:29] <rxaviers> what OS and IM version are you using gnarf?
[09:12:43] <rxaviers> convert -version
[09:12:58] <gnarf> i have ImageMagick 6.7.7-6  on my mac
[09:14:15] <rxaviers> cool ok
[09:15:49] <gnarf> the texture isn't there tho
[09:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's a flat image.
[09:17:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, 
[09:17:03] <rxaviers> convert -debug all -size 40x100 'xc:#aaa' template/themeroller/texture/flat.png -compose dissolve -define compose:args=0,100 -composite /tmp/output.png | tee /tmp/debug

[09:18:16] <rxaviers> checking
[09:24:45] <kborchers> rxaviers: fails for me http://cl.ly/image/1b2Y0R2H1e0G
[09:25:17] <rxaviers> what's your version kborchers?
[09:25:46] <rxaviers> debug shows no explicit problem.. :/
[09:27:37] <kborchers> rxaviers: Version: ImageMagick 6.8.0-7 2013-02-20 Q16
[09:27:43] <rxaviers> thks
[09:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I should try to compile manually to get an even newer version.
[09:43:58] <rxaviers> plz just let me know how that goes.. 
[09:49:12] <ngsilverman> oh I also had a question about the z-index of the draggable/helper
[09:49:28] <ngsilverman> do we set it to an arbitrary high value?
[09:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> never
[09:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> Use .ui-front
[09:49:47] <ngsilverman> ok!
[09:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> As long as the helper is relative/absolute/fixed (which it will be), then .ui-front will add a z-index.
[09:50:09] <ngsilverman> perfect
[10:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm not having much luck with the direct install
[10:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> $ /usr/local/bin/ImageMagick-6.8.3/bin/convert -size 40x100 'xc:#aaa' template/themeroller/texture/flat.png -compose dissolve -define compose:args=0,100 -composite /tmp/output.png

[11:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll petersendidit: Speaking of spam...
[11:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed that AUTHORS.txt got spammed.
[11:34:20] <petersendidit> I hadn't had to mark something as spam in ages
[11:34:31] <petersendidit> Had to mark 5 today and 8 yesterday
[11:43:52] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im back. I will try to install the newest version manually here too and will check
[12:04:52] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I just compiled (6.8.3-3), tested it and it worked
[12:04:58] <rxaviers> here's the commands I used
[12:05:02] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/4998952
[12:06:40] <scott_gonzalez> ghetto OS X doesn't even have wget.
[12:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> curling right now
[12:07:19] <rxaviers> :P
[12:08:06] <rxaviers> final test.. if it fails. maybe a bug due to OS ..
[12:10:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, authors.txt email from nigera? :)
[12:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think so. Didn't look at the message too closely.
[12:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> Just noticed the names in the TO: field.

[12:12:36] <rxaviers> petersendidit, you lucky I mark spam things everyday (and using gmail) :/
[12:13:00] <petersendidit> rxaviers: Just have gotten use to never seeing spam
[12:13:16] <rxaviers> :)
[12:13:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, let me check your config output too plz
[12:13:48] <gnarf> petersendidit: agree with rxaviers - you're lucky
[12:14:32] <gnarf> I've had gnarf@gnarf.net for 15 years, and its been in domain name registries for just as long.  I've been getting spam every day since the 90s
[12:14:46] <gnarf> gnarf@gnarf.net gets ~250 emails a day, of which maybe 10 are actually not spam
[12:15:09] <petersendidit> Guess I am just lucky
[12:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/4999094#file-configure-txt
[12:21:43] <rxaviers> Im guessing this has something to do with lib png being 32bit, not 64bit `-lpng15`.. checking
[12:32:53] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, argh I dont know... Maybe this helps: add in ./configure: CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/lib64/" if you happen to have this path
[12:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> I do not.
[12:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:34:40] <rxaviers> aha we can try this instructions
[12:34:41] <rxaviers> http://www.imagemagick.org/script/advanced-unix-installation.php#macosx
[12:35:13] <rxaviers> But, we can skip the X things for sure.
[12:36:15] <rxaviers>  
[12:36:29] <rxaviers> and last trial, using this binary http://www.imagemagick.org/download/binaries/ImageMagick-x86_64-apple-darwin12.2.0.tar.gz
[12:36:48] <rxaviers> ideal would be to compile it :S
[13:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell rxaviers compiling 6.8.3 worked
[13:48:45] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell rxaviers about that.

[16:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman Dave_Stein: Any idea why this .removeClass() call exists? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js#L757
[16:24:01] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to blame support
[16:24:28] <Dave_Stein> damn you modified that recently and it wasnt that 
[16:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> How is this possibly a 404? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blame/87796aff/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js
[16:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh...path change
[16:26:05] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blame/master/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js
[16:26:19] <Dave_Stein> but also that's in master what you sent
[16:26:26] <Dave_Stein> which i rarely look at
[16:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/25ad531eb4121d588d4d7f1a14c9c517ad1eeb21
[16:26:58] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Paul Bakaus (52mon 4d ago): sortable: fixed issue with first time append of the placeholder, now also the original classes are appended to the placeholder, with usually should give it the right size
[16:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ok.
[16:27:43] <Dave_Stein> maybe ui-sortable-helper meant something else back in the day
[16:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> So it's because it's copying the classes from the element.
[16:28:13] <Dave_Stein> oh oh i see what you mean
[16:28:29] <Dave_Stein> it's copying from helper to the placeholder
[16:29:01] <Dave_Stein> you wouldn't believe the noise in here - doing a build and watching playstation 4 talk
[16:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm in Panera and it's pretty loud here too.
[16:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> I miss my old Panera.
[16:30:36] <Dave_Stein> you're in PA now right?
[16:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[16:31:20] <Dave_Stein> well i bet people in there have manners and arent yelling about xbox controllers currently :P
[16:31:25] <Caraes_Naur> Hey guys... I have a few patches I did in 1.8.18 that I'd like to push upstream
[16:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> Caraes_Naur: Are there tickets for whatever you changed?
[16:33:05] <Caraes_Naur> what I did for #6830 seems to have been done separately
[16:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, 1.8.18 is super old.
[16:33:27] <Caraes_Naur> one is related to #7237 and #6185
[16:33:31] <Caraes_Naur> I realize that :)
[16:33:44] <Caraes_Naur> another is related to #7701
[16:33:59] <Caraes_Naur> the remaining two don't seem to have tickets
[16:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> #7237 isn't a bug and won't be accepted as a feature.
[16:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, new question.
[16:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have any patches you want to submit that we haven't already said we won't accept? :-)
[16:35:39] <Caraes_Naur> I have a datepicker format patch that returns seconds instead of millis
[16:35:57] <scott_gonzalez> No new features in datepicker.
[16:36:29] <Caraes_Naur> a dialog patch that exposes an option to disable focusTabbable
[16:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[16:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> That would break accessibility.
[16:37:27] <Dave_Stein> you are depressing sometimes
[16:37:34] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> http://vimeo.com/56402326 :-)
[16:38:19] <Caraes_Naur> in the project these patches come from, focusTabbale became a hindrance because the first focusable element in our dialogs is a button that .show()s the help text
[16:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> Caraes_Naur: You can change which element gains focus now.
[16:38:58] <Caraes_Naur> when did that land?
[16:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.0
[16:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#added-ability-to-specify-which-element-to-focus-on-open
[16:39:35] <Caraes_Naur> ok, so that's two of mine with fixes/workarounds in 1.10.0
[16:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> Caraes_Naur: Are you aware of our API redesigns?
[16:40:52] <Caraes_Naur> only somewhat
[16:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: I'm fixing a sortable bug right now. SHOCKING!
[16:41:16] <Dave_Stein> in < 2 I imagine
[16:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:41:30] <Dave_Stein> make a test for your fix! :D
[16:41:36] <Caraes_Naur> why no new features in datepicker?
[16:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> Because datepicker is being rewritten from scratch.
[16:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> We're not making any API changes until that happens.
[16:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> And the API will be much smaller in the new version.
[16:42:28] <Caraes_Naur> is it going to include a timepicker now?
[16:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> no
[16:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker will never include a timepicker.
[16:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> That would be a separate widget.
[16:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> Just like in HTML.
[16:42:57] <Dave_Stein> but you could probably put the two together
[16:43:05] <Dave_Stein> in your app
[16:43:11] <Caraes_Naur> I would need to put the two together
[16:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> There should be 3 separate widgets.
[16:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> datepicker, timepicker, datetimepicker
[16:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> datetimepicker should be a composite of datepicker + timepicker.
[16:44:37] <Caraes_Naur> we use Trent Richardson's timepicker addon
[16:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> Those guys who write specs...they know what they're doing (mostly) :-)
[16:51:30] <Caraes_Naur> yeah, mostly :)
[16:51:35] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez Are you a freelancer btw?
[16:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[16:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> I don't accept any work though :-P
[16:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> All jQuery all the time.
[16:53:45] <Caraes_Naur> is there any interest in a durationpicker widget?
[16:53:52] <Dave_Stein> you get paid by jQuery??
[16:53:58] <Dave_Stein> Caraes_Naur that sounds like a slider :D
[16:54:09] <Dave_Stein> unless you mean day, week, etc heh
[16:54:14] <Dave_Stein> which im guessing you mean
[16:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> Caraes_Naur: I think we're pretty far away from thinking about any new widgets that aren't already on the roadmap.
[16:54:19] <Caraes_Naur> Dave_Stein: it's actualy a configurable set of up to 7 sliders
[16:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: yes
[16:55:42] <Dave_Stein> crazy
[16:55:44] <Caraes_Naur> one slider each for milli, sec, min, hr, day, week, month, quarter, and year
[16:55:45] <Dave_Stein> that applies to both of you
[16:56:44] <Caraes_Naur> we needed one in our app, but nothing like that seemed to exist
[16:56:52] <Caraes_Naur> so we made one
[16:57:23] <Dave_Stein> I don't think that's common enough to warrant a UI widget
[16:57:46] <Dave_Stein> i've done over 100 sites and never needed anything like that 
[16:57:48] <Caraes_Naur> we're making a scheduling app, we use it in at least a dozen places
[16:58:00] <Dave_Stein> you can always open source it on git as its own widget
[16:58:09] <Caraes_Naur> that's the plan
[16:58:14] <Dave_Stein> :)
[16:59:19] <Dave_Stein> i have a lot of UI widgets on my site that are ours only
[16:59:26] <Dave_Stein> maybe one day we'll open source em but they are pretty app specific
[16:59:51] <Caraes_Naur> ours could have been app specific, but we decided early on not to go that route
[17:00:50] <Caraes_Naur> it has more features than we use
[17:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> Caraes_Naur: Do you have more users than just you right now?
[17:02:17] <Caraes_Naur> the app is proprietary, only the devs and a few potential investors have seen it
[17:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> "it has more features than we use" sounds like it might be bad design then :-/
[17:03:32] <Caraes_Naur> any of the standard widgets have more features than most people use
[17:04:37] <Caraes_Naur> such as, I have yet to put icons on tabs
[17:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs don't support icons.
[17:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> So...yeah, you probably haven't :-P
[17:07:11] <Caraes_Naur> well, then I've never used primary and secondary icons on buttons
[17:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> You've never used an icon in a button?
[17:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> You think that most users have never used icons?
[17:08:05] <Caraes_Naur> primary, never secondary
[17:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> So you've pointed out a half-feature that you don't use?
[17:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> We're pretty stringent about what we put in our widgets.
[17:09:34] <Caraes_Naur> I've never seen th oint of putting 2 icons on a button
[17:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this is just getting off on a tangent.
[17:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> I was just saying if you were adding options just to make it not app-specific, you may not have been designing properly.
[17:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> not app specific = generic, not full of features.
[17:10:55] <Caraes_Naur> our durationpicker isn't bloated, if that's what you're taking about
[17:11:13] <Caraes_Naur> we just made it more full-featured than our app uses
[17:12:51] <Caraes_Naur> because we decided from the beginning it was going to get open sourced
[17:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Incoming!
