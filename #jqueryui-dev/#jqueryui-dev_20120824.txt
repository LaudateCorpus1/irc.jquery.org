[06:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> :D
[06:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, what's up?
[06:12:04] <gnarf> hey
[06:12:16] <gnarf> so - xmllint
[06:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> <3
[06:12:24] <gnarf> on the api.qunitjs.com site
[06:12:36] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1w1t0s0T401A
[06:12:43] <gnarf> what am i missing?
[06:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I used to know this.
[06:14:57] <gnarf> i cant figure out where the xmllint task is defined
[06:14:59] <gnarf> either
[06:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-jquery-content
[06:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Try `npm update`
[06:15:58] <gnarf> how do i install xmllint?
[06:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Also, which version of node is this?
[06:16:14] <gnarf> 0.8.6
[06:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> It comes in grunt-jquery-content
[06:33:59] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you around?
[07:34:54] <jzaefferer> gnarf: here now
[07:35:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you remember by chance what I wanted to ask jzaefferer about? lol
[07:36:11] <jzaefferer> gnarf: :p
[07:36:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: oh - download.jqueryui.com seems broken
[07:37:20] <jzaefferer> gnarf: you mean http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:3000/ ?
[07:37:23] <gnarf> yes
[07:37:49] <jzaefferer> sshing...
[07:38:15] <jzaefferer> so the repo is on latest master
[07:38:17] <jzaefferer> that's good
[07:38:48] <jzaefferer> probably broken because we need to run `grunt prepare` again
[07:38:53] <jzaefferer> after the cleanup
[07:39:21] <gnarf> you can try /etc/init.d/download-ui start
[07:39:28] <gnarf> to get it running again
[07:39:39] <gnarf> although there are like no logs
[07:39:40] <gnarf> so
[07:40:27] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:41:13] <jzaefferer> just did that, after preparing...
[07:41:32] <jzaefferer> there's two node processes
[07:41:38] <jzaefferer> but server is still dead
[07:42:55] <jzaefferer> ah, the script is busted
[07:43:00] <jzaefferer> things changed..
[07:43:12] <jzaefferer> should be the last time for a while...
[07:43:17] <jzaefferer> updating the init.d scriot
[07:44:12] <jzaefferer> gnarf: back online
[07:45:32] <jzaefferer> gnarf: some logging from the init.d script would be pretty nice
[07:45:55] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it would be, but start-stop-daemon assumes no term
[07:46:01] <gnarf> so use syslog, or log to a file
[07:47:44] <jzaefferer> gnarf: what's syslog? does that have other stuff?
[07:47:54] <jzaefferer> can we just log to a file?
[07:48:06] <gnarf> plugins & notifier are both using syslog
[07:48:30] <jzaefferer> gnarf: how do I look at syslog?
[07:48:58] <jzaefferer> gnarf: also, can we proxy the node process to stage.download.jqueryui.com? could then test with stage.jqueryui.com/download (not there yet)
[07:49:00] <gnarf> less /var/log/syslog
[07:49:21] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sure
[07:49:36] <jzaefferer> gnarf: syslog prepends?
[07:49:46] <gnarf> no
[07:49:48] <gnarf> it appents
[07:49:55] <jzaefferer> so tail is much more useful?
[07:50:01] <gnarf> probably
[07:50:04] <jzaefferer> okay :-)
[07:50:32] <jzaefferer> soo, once the proxy is there, we can test the site integration. On that side, its just a matter of adding two lines to the jquerui.com grunt file and deploying
[08:10:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the log stuff btw, scott_gonzalez had abstracted it into jquery/node-logger
[08:10:24] <gnarf> or something like that
[08:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, jquery/node-logger
[08:11:23] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server/blob/master/package.json#L18 https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server/blob/master/notifier-server.js#L22
[08:11:48] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/node-logger
[08:13:11] <gnarf> hrm
[08:13:30] <gnarf> is blog.jquery.com a private repo for a reason?
[08:15:44] <gnarf> and scott_gonzalez https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com -- lol - the README.md is informative there ;)
[08:16:07] <gnarf> totally missed out on those xml things boo
[08:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> heh, README.md got intererpeted as a link and took me to https://github.com/echonest/pyechonest/blob/master/README.md
[08:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> which made me quite confused
[08:18:21] <gnarf> heh
[08:18:37] <gnarf> i just realized that had i read the readme, i might of installed those things :)
[08:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.0-rc.1/jquery-ui.js :-)
[08:35:26] <kborchers> \o/
[08:35:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: now release notes?
[08:35:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: want to write one for color too? lol
[08:40:09] <gnarf> jzaefferer: http://stage.download.jqueryui.com/
[08:43:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what needs to happen to get http://stage.api.qunitjs.com/category/All/ working?
[08:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/35
[08:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'll be AFK for most of the day now, going to be driving up to PA very soon.
[08:56:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: alrighty - drive safe
[09:14:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, I have a question for you guys... ThemeRoller produces images for two things: icons + textures. To produce them, it relies on an extensive php code that uses a phpThumb lib that wraps image magick tools in the underneath (from what I saw).  Ok, the thing is: porting all that code (and making sure we're still building the same thing) will take a considerable effort. Although, both (icons and textures) seems to be deprecate
[09:14:01] <rxaviers> d in the long term according the wiki [http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39787461/ThemeRoller%20Rewrite]. I would like to know what you think of this: 1) We port ThemeRoller to node, except img creation, 2) Node ThemeRoller will create the images by fetching them from the current site since it will be kept for older UI versions anyway  ... Benefits: quicker and lower risk of future bugs. We are able to better use our time to rewrite the new thing (as
[09:14:02] <rxaviers> in wiki). Possible issue: 1) take longer to create the package - It will strongly depend on the network / topology. If both machines (new and old download builders) are in the same subnet, I think that latency wont be a problem.
[09:14:59] <[MAN]> hi guys
[09:15:10] <[MAN]> I have a problem with jquery ui and modal dialog
[09:15:19] <[MAN]> here is an example http://jsfiddle.net/2FkAx/
[09:15:21] <gnarf> [MAN]: #jquery for support please
[09:15:55] <[MAN]> ok thanks for redirect
[09:16:06] <[MAN]> not sure they will help
[09:16:41] <gnarf> [MAN]: this is the development channel, we don't do support here
[09:16:56] <gnarf> rxaviers: so the proxy isn't too terrible
[09:17:03] <gnarf> rxaviers: the machines are in the same data center
[09:17:49] <gnarf> rxaviers: I think that getting it to actually do the image creation would be a "right after everything else works" feature tho
[09:18:15] <gnarf> even if its shelling to imagick
[09:18:16] <[MAN]> gnarf: I thought some developers will help me, maybe someone have experiense
[09:18:41] <gnarf> [MAN]: those of us that are willing to provide support on IRC are also in #jquery
[09:20:02] <[MAN]> 10x
[09:48:55] <rxaviers> gnarf, good to know (sorry I was away having lunch)
[09:49:44] * rxaviers leaving again brb in 1h
