[02:18:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: cherry-picked the button commit, but can't release. No idea how we missed this - maybe shelljs changed, and we install without specifying a version? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8848

[02:58:32] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Anyone around?
[03:17:31] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: sup?
[03:19:39] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Hey! Any reason the data items for superclasses are unset?
[03:20:01] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: i.e., all data items from my widget to $.Widget should point to my widget's data.
[03:20:05] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: No?
[03:20:38] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: In mobile, we have $.Widget -> $.mobile.widget -> $.mobile.page for instance.
[03:20:49] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: But, only .data( "mobile-page" ) will be set.
[03:21:27] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Is there a good reason why .data( "mobile-widget" ) is not set on the same element, containing a reference to the page widget data?
[03:21:48] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: This would make polymorphism work.
[03:22:07] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: ... at least so it seems at first glance.
[03:22:55] <jzaefferer> One highlight is enough ;)
[03:23:05] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Sorry ...
[03:24:16] <jzaefferer> I don't know if there's a reason why this isn't happening. Likely just not something we looked at before. I know that $.Widget is barely or not at all polymorphic. Not sure if that's all that's missing though, probably not.
[03:25:02] <jzaefferer> For example, the event prefix is also important. When binding to "datasource-request", I don't care if its a odata-datasource, it should have the same datasource-prefix
[03:26:01] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: feel free to open a ticket for this and include the above
[03:27:03] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: I guess you're right. Events triggered by a given class should have the prefix of that class, and events triggered by a subclass should have the prefix of the subclass.
[03:27:43] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Unfortunately, events are not currently declared a priori. That is, a class does not declare in its prototype that "I shall be emitting the following events: []" ...
[03:28:00] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: You can pretty much _trigger( "anything" ).
[03:29:59] <_|Nix|_> Sorry - I'm just so used to prefixing my text with the addressee's nick ...
[03:31:12] <_|Nix|_> I suppose this is quite involved, especially during _trigger, because it would have to figure out which prefix to attach to the event ...

[04:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's intentional.
[04:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> Search for polymorphism in the bug tracker.
[04:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: For now, just change the two require() calls in your local copy to make it work.
[04:18:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, will do that. Wading through jquery-validation PRs right now. I need a mikesherov there as well :/
[04:18:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[04:19:52] <jzaefferer> no?

[04:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking you shouldn't curl | node
[04:20:12] <jzaefferer> right

[05:17:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott, I would like to add a general note under methods on the api docs for collapsible sets. (just to say that to expand or collapse items in a set, users need to call the respective methods on individual collapsibles.) do you think we should add the possibility to do that (add a note) before we describe widget methods (or event, or options)?

[08:21:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, actually, it's already in the README

[08:21:25] <jzaefferer> Let's move that to the previous line
[08:21:33] <jzaefferer> I saw "`node server.js` to run the server, go to the URL it outputs."
[08:21:40] <jzaefferer> That's misleading
[08:23:14] <rxaviers> It does output the URL, but log the errors and other messages.

[08:31:23] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I've pushed web-base-template some time ago and still not seeing a new footer on http://stage.jqueryui.com/
[08:32:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: any idea what's going on?
[08:32:32] <jzaefferer> the site itself updated
[08:32:40] <gnarf> the last update was Nov 22 01:06:18 jq01 notifier-server[31757]: web-base-template.sh:err:HEAD is now at 21ea17d... Fix "API Documentation" width on jquery.com home page back to "Documentation"
[08:32:58] <gnarf> its possible that the post-receive just didn't send out an update
[08:33:05] <gnarf> oh wait
[08:33:06] <gnarf> sorry 
[08:33:09] <gnarf> wrong jq01
[08:33:55] <gnarf> yeah, one sec jzaefferer I know what the problem is
[08:33:58] <gnarf> I'll fix it
[08:34:12] <jzaefferer> so great to have you around just now
[08:34:16] <gnarf> I switched the git fetch to git fetch -t but apparently that only fetches tags
[08:34:21] <jzaefferer> everything else went smoothly
[08:34:26] <jzaefferer> yep
[08:34:47] <jzaefferer> happened with download builder, too
[08:35:32] <gnarf> so
[08:35:39] <gnarf> without doing git fetch ; git fetch -t
[08:35:44] <gnarf> anyone know a way to do both?
[08:35:52] <jzaefferer> git fetch origin master -t?
[08:36:09] <jzaefferer> dunno
[08:36:13] <jzaefferer> that works when pushing
[08:36:31] <jzaefferer> pushing 4 tags :-)
[08:37:11] <gnarf> so like without the -t
[08:37:15] <gnarf> it doesn't get "orphaned" tags
[08:37:24] <gnarf> and with the -t it doesn't grab HEADs
[08:37:32] <gnarf> so i guess i just have to fetch both
[08:38:01] <jzaefferer> orphaned tags suck, I just tried to push 1.0.14 :/
[08:38:28] <jzaefferer> tagged 1.0.16 instead
[08:40:04] <gnarf> you tag it off of master? I think we are good there now
[08:40:13] <gnarf> you had most of the commits and you signed off
[08:40:13] <gnarf> so
[08:40:15] <gnarf> whateves
[08:40:18] <gnarf> lets get back on master
[08:40:19] <gnarf> :)
[08:41:46] <jzaefferer> its done!
[08:41:56] <jzaefferer> 1.9.2 is out
[08:42:17] <jzaefferer> http://blog.jqueryui.com/ totally points to the wrong version in the footer
[08:42:45] <jzaefferer> apparently no one gives a fuck, its been like that for a while anyway
[08:42:48] <gnarf> blog isn't a web-base-template
[08:43:52] <jzaefferer> my eqivalent of the red button: http://bassistance.de/i/c82511.png
[08:44:06] <jzaefferer> yeah, I know. I'd rather finish that migration then wasting time updating the custom theme
[08:48:30] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, may give a suggestion on documentation? More precisely on http://api.jqueryui.com/<component>'s, I think the short description should be more visible. Some QuickNav's are pretty big and the short description gets lost. I was expecting a short description just underneath the component name.

[12:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: There's already a section to write general notes about the widget. I don't think we should have additional sections for options/methods/events.
[12:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You should only ever have to modify the minutes and seconds on trac. The hour will always be correct.
[12:56:35] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok.
[13:03:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've added the note in the general widget section. Thx for getting back to me.
