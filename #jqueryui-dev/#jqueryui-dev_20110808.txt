[09:56:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so with position, if "within" is scrolled and that places the "of" off screen, the positioned element should still not flip or fit, correct? since it's still inside of its "within"
[09:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[09:57:49] <kborchers> ok, that is what's happening but the tests don't account for figuring the elements new position correctly so they are failing. thanks
[10:02:46] <jzaefferer> started putting together a composite demo, based on the tooltip video player: http://jzaefferer.github.com/jquery-ui-videoplayer/
[10:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: that could be interesting with support for opening local video and audio files
[10:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> and dropping the like/add/share buttons
[13:24:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: can i bug you with another position question?
[13:24:33] <scott_gonzalez> yup, got 5 minutes before I've got a call
[13:25:15] <kborchers> is it expected that the element can't be positioned when "of" is scrolled off screen? example http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/zFf5y/
[13:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> should work
[13:28:42] <kborchers> ok, i'll keep looking. something screwy in calculating of's position once off screen.
[13:28:58] <kborchers> that's in the current 1.8.15 version, not mine
[14:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> it's probably the within
[14:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> the offset of within doesn't change when you scroll its content, right?
[14:01:48] <kborchers> right
[14:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's the problem
[14:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> turn off collision and it's correct
[14:03:17] <scott_gonzalez> so the definition of within is based on what made sense for windo
[14:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> *window
[14:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> which is that we only look at the visible portion of a scrollable area
[14:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> not sure if we should allow configuring that
[14:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> or if we should just special case window
[14:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> or if we should just leave it how it is
[14:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> at a minimum, if we keep it how it is, we should put a note in the docs
[14:07:09] <kborchers> yeah, i would be ok with leaving it how it is. not sure how often positioning something within a scrolled element will come up and if someone really needed it, they may be able to workaround withouth collision detection
[14:07:57] <kborchers> since, the collision detection, if it was working would position it in that same exact spot anyway and not do any fit or flip
[14:09:03] <kborchers> so is that an official decision or you want to bring it up at this week's meeting for discussion?
[14:11:14] <kborchers> also, if we are going to leave it like that, i should probably just remove the scroll collision test since it will never pass right?
[14:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> the scroll test should be testing that we take the scroll into account
[14:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> in the original tests (before within), we were making sure that collision within in the window actually kept the element in the window when scrolled
[14:27:43] <kborchers> sorry, i was talking about the scroll test in the within tests
[14:28:26] <kborchers> i could leave it there and just set collision to none and check to make sure the position is correct
[14:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> that seems fine
[14:28:53] <kborchers> the current test was checking flip collision with scroll
[14:29:13] <kborchers> ok, i'll do that
[14:30:03] <kborchers> thanks again. time to head home
