[09:24:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, certainly a usecase we hadn't considered - will test using focusout instead
[09:28:35] <gnarf> jzaefferer: thanks
[09:28:55] <gnarf> i made the change in my own custom version of ui i built for this project
[09:28:59] <gnarf> so i hope it lands :)
[09:44:47] <gnarf> jzaefferer: have you thought about "delayed response" tooltips at all?
[09:47:13] <jzaefferer> gnarf: kind of
[09:47:44] <jzaefferer> see http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/tooltip/tooltip.html
[09:47:52] <jzaefferer> the two "gets its content via ajax"
[09:48:22] <gnarf> hrm
[09:48:40] <gnarf> so if i used the content function to delay the response and it returned no content to start
[09:48:45] <gnarf> i get delayed response
[09:48:47] <gnarf> interesting
[10:07:51] <jzaefferer> does that work for you?

[10:40:13] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tooltip: Replace blur with focusout to deal with inputs nested in tooltipped elements. - Jörn Zaefferer
[10:40:17] <jzaefferer> gnarf: ^^^

[10:45:24] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Tooltip: Replace blur with focusout to deal with inputs nested in tooltipped elements.
[11:11:24] <gnarf> jzaefferer: thanks!
[11:11:43] <gnarf> and the delayed response thing just got ugly
[11:11:48] <gnarf> so now there is a new problem
[11:12:09] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/59f3daef9542d5a3fb17
[11:12:15] <gnarf> this is basically what i was doing
[11:12:31] <gnarf> but now - if you hover something, and leave before the response - the tip still opens and gets stuck open
[11:13:10] <gnarf> i assume if i used some "filler" content that problem wouldn't happen
[11:13:31] <gnarf> but because the _open never gets called unless the content function returns something - the bindings for close never happen
[11:14:14] <gnarf> also - random question related to grid - who was it that did the code to make the "header" match the body of the table?
[11:15:07] <gnarf> jzaefferer: just thinking about it - the delay before the tooltip opens might want to be a built in option... lots of tooltip usecases will want some sort of delay on some events
[11:26:00] <jzaefferer> gnarf: you should set the items option when using the content option
[11:26:08] <jzaefferer> see also http://jquery.github.com/jquery-docs/jquery-ui/tooltip/tooltip.xml
[11:26:24] <jzaefferer> gnarf: grid fixed header was built by rworth
[11:26:39] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah, it would be the same as the default btw
[11:27:03] <gnarf> jzaefferer: in that particular use case - items: "[title]"
[11:40:34] <gnarf> jzaefferer: here's another interesting one: http://jsfiddle.net/pm4JG/2/
[11:40:52] <gnarf> tooltips aren't disappearing if they are on a disabled input
[11:45:18] <gnarf> i thought that might have something to do with using _bind - but it doesn't
[12:02:27] <gnarf> jzaefferer: http://jsfiddle.net/pm4JG/5/ -- so mouseenter and mouseleave don't fire on [disabled] inputs - but the "delegated" version of those events does
[12:09:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: some conversation ensued on #jquery-dev about that one
[12:09:14] <gnarf> its not really our problem - but something at a deeper (i think browser) level

[17:20:21] <jedinix> i'm having a bit of a problem: script loaded via a php document in (jquery-ui) tabs (using ajax) is like "held in memory" so if the tab is re-.load'd the script is like doubled and any listeners such as .click run twice after the reload
