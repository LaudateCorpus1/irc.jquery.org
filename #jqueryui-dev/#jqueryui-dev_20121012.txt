[05:32:12] <anger> About tabs, is the #hashtag still supposed to be working?
[05:32:27] <anger> Noticed that currently it's working only on IE
[05:32:44] <anger> Chrome & Firefox just display the contents of the first tab...
[06:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> anger: Please clarify your question.
[06:12:49] <scott_gonzalez> Are you asking about ajax tabs and location.hash?
[06:21:48] <anger> scott_gonzalez: yes, ajax version of .tabs() and location.hash
[06:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8660
[06:22:24] <anger> I have a intra site http://intra/company/123/#Certificates
[06:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's a regression.
[06:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> It works for in-page tabs.
[06:23:04] <anger> .tabs() used to automaticly select the tab id="Certificates"
[06:24:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: damn i missed one :(
[06:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: There's no demo for it.
[06:25:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: true
[06:26:10] <anger> scott_gonzalez: the difference I have compared to the demo mentioned in the bug tracker is that I already have divs in place also for the ajax content
[06:26:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: let's just blame it on gnarf then since he's never around this early to defend himself :D
[06:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> anger: It's still ajax tabs.
[06:28:46] <anger> So what you are saying is that its not a bug and it won't work in the future?
[06:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> anger: What I'm saying is that it's a bug, which I pointed you to, and it will be fixed.
[06:30:54] <anger> scott_gonzalez: Ok, thanks for the clarification!
[06:45:46] <anger> Out of curiosity, are you also going to add a feature to update location.hash when user selects a tab?
[07:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> anger: no
[07:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> No widget should have built-in logic for changing the location.
[08:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> anger: I've got a fix for this bug. It'll land this morning.
[08:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> Damn, 1.9.0 is quality code.
[08:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> Every single bug has been super easy to fix.

[08:07:32] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tabs: Use aria-controls instead of the anchor's href to match against location.hash. Fixes #8660 - Tabs: Set initial active tab from location hash for ajax tabs. - Scott González
[08:07:52] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had a single bug yet where I needed to refactor anything.

[10:03:36] <rworth> .
[10:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> .
[10:16:25] <anger> scott_gonzalez: Wow! I'm impressed! :)
[10:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> anger: Gotta stay on top of those bugs :-)
[10:19:29] <anger> You just make it look too easy :)
[13:21:39] <gnarf> okay
[13:21:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / nacin - care to explain: http://stage.jqueryui.com/Changelog/1.8.24/
[13:21:56] <gnarf> vs http://stage.jqueryui.com/changelog/1.8.24/
[13:22:00] <gnarf> why does the case matter?
[13:22:16] <nacin> because case matters in URL paths?
[13:23:05] <gnarf> nacin: is it possible to make it catch both without having to rewrite at nginx level?
[13:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: But doesn't WordPress auto-redirect for close matches?
[13:23:17] <nacin> we auto-redirect for a lot of things; case is not one of them
[13:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it redirected /antyhing/1.8.24/
[13:23:52] <nacin> nope, not for post types. too ambiguous
[13:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> At least it does for my local install.
[13:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> Production does too :-)
[13:24:15] <nacin> funky
[13:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/wordpress-voodoo/1.8.24/
[13:24:35] <nacin> you got me
[13:24:37] <nacin> no idea
[13:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[13:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's entirely possible that it's one of our custom plugins.
[13:25:04] <gnarf> well
[13:25:14] <gnarf> I'd like to avoid the nginx rewrite where i can
[13:25:25] <nacin> there is 0% need for an nginx rewrite here
[13:26:14] <gnarf> so whats the better approach
[13:26:27] <nacin> why do you have uppercase for URLs like that to begin with?
[13:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Does nacin know what you're trying to do?
[13:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> guess not
[13:26:38] <nacin> not at all.
[13:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:26:49] <gnarf> nacin: old URLS
[13:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> He wants to rewrite old URLs to new URLs
[13:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/docs/Changelog/1.8.24
[13:26:59] <nacin> what old URLs in particular?
[13:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> He wants the rule to be simple and just drop the /docs/
[13:27:29] <gnarf>  /docs/Changelog -> /changelog but the rest are just s#/docs##
[13:27:31] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[13:27:34] <nacin> what is dropping /docs/ now?
[13:27:52] <gnarf> nothing "now" but i'm playing with an nginx rewrite to remove /docs
[13:28:02] <gnarf> there are more than just /docs/Changelog links out there
[13:28:04] <nacin> how many old URLs are we talking?
[13:28:32] <gnarf> nacin: small number here
[13:28:32] <nacin> hardcoded in an nginx location /docs/ block is going to be the fastest
[13:28:47] <gnarf> nacin: but that eats perf from EVERY request on jqueryui.com
[13:29:06] <gnarf> for this /docs/ -> / i got that working tho
[13:29:09] <gnarf> with an nginx
[13:29:15] <gnarf> problem is - Changelog vs changelog now
[13:30:21] <nacin> can you just hack in a Changelog -> changelog in nginx for now, and I'll solve it through WP next week?
[13:31:43] <gnarf> yes
[13:39:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://citadel.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20host%3Djq01*%20source%3D%22*%2Fjqueryui.com*%22%20status%3E200%20bytes%3E1724%20referer!%3D%22-%22%20referer%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fjqueryui.com%2Fthemeroller%2F%22
[13:39:59] <gnarf> seems our themeroller is pushing them to that url
[13:42:30] <gnarf> damn, no rxaviers
[13:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm not sure what I'm looking at
[13:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> I keep getting St9bad_alloc on that page, so I don't see the resutls.
[13:43:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sorry
[13:43:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the /themeroller page is making image requests to jqueryui.com
[13:43:42] <gnarf> instead of to old.jqueryui.com
[13:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[13:47:39] <gnarf> not sure where or how
[13:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: When I open themeroller and change some settings I only see requests going out to old.
[13:47:45] <gnarf> but its responsible for some of these 404s
[13:47:58] <gnarf> try changing a texture
[13:48:31] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/2k060m2v2C0L
[13:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I just got thi: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/images/?new=555555&w=40&h=40&f=png&q=100&fltr[]=over|textures/08_diagonals_thick.png|0|0|100
[13:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> very strange
[13:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> The color that it's using isn't even in my settings.
[13:51:59] <_zoggy_> default? inherit previously set theme?
[13:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> Found it.
[13:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'll fix this in download builder and deploy

[13:58:09] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, is there a swarm link for jui that i can load up and let it test that browser to make sure nothing is broken? (wanted to test firefox 16.0.1)
[13:59:20] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: You can't connect to the swarm, but you can run individual tests from swarm.
[13:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1015
[13:59:37] <scott_gonzalez> Just click the test name on the left and it'll run.
[13:59:52] <scott_gonzalez> We don't allow anyone to actually connect and report results.
[14:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> Because we got too many bogus results with inactive browsers and browser extensions.
[14:00:36] <_zoggy_> gotcha, could have sworn there used to be a swarm that ive connected to in the past..  its been awhile though
[14:01:03] <_zoggy_> yeah, this looks vaugely similar
[14:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we stopped doing that a while ago.
[14:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> You can run the full suite outside of TestSwarm too: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all-active.html
[14:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> And you can go full bleeding edge if you want: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all-active.html?jquery=git
[14:03:15] <_zoggy_> ok ty, running now
[14:04:42] <_zoggy_> ok yeah, what i rememeber doing previously.. that full suite swarm
[14:04:43] <_zoggy_> Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
[14:04:43] <_zoggy_> Tests completed in 34120 milliseconds.
[14:04:43] <_zoggy_> 4112 tests of 4112 passed, 0 failed.
[14:05:20] <_zoggy_> (note i am running win7 x64 and ff 16.0.1), dunno if the user agent stuff just needs to be updated or what
[14:07:36] <scott_gonzalez> We update TestSwarm based on when BrowserStack updates.
[14:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack is always a bit behind the releases.
[14:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> So it still thinks that Firefox 16 is beta.
[14:11:15] <_zoggy_> gotcha
[14:12:32] <_zoggy_> so is everyone with jquery just volunteers?
[14:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> mostly
[14:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm very close to working on jQuery full time.
[14:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> And it will be full time very soon.
[14:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm the only one.
[14:13:53] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few people working part time.
[14:14:56] <_zoggy_> wiki page needs to be updated to reflect the new widgets, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery_UI
[14:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh great, just what we need. More page to update ;-)
[14:15:38] <_zoggy_> :P
[14:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> "jQuery is a multi-browser JavaScript library..." STFU
[14:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> What a bunch of douchebags.
[14:17:16] <_zoggy_> have a question for ya, one of my friends is a creator of a jquery plugin (tablesorter), he has his own plugins/addons.. etc. is there an easy way to test his core js to find out what the min jquery dependency is? and then also for each of the plugins?
[14:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> Does he have a test suite?
[14:18:34] <_zoggy_> sadly no
[14:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> Then no :-P
[14:18:50] <_zoggy_> https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter
[14:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> The only way would be to manually play with demos using different jQuery versions.
[14:19:37] <_zoggy_> right, was hoping there was some plugin/extension i could load up that would bascailly load/unload jquery versions and tell me which ones it worked on
[14:19:50] <_zoggy_> he has tons of demos.. but no test suite
[14:20:07] <_zoggy_> hes not opposed to having them, just has never done any test suites and doesnt know where to start
[14:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say have him look at some UI tests to get an idea.
[14:20:53] <gnarf> if you wrote tests, its pretty easy to swap in a different jQuery version --- our suite supports ?jquery=version
[14:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> Have him start with a simple plugin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/tests/unit/progressbar
[14:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is how I added support for multiple jQuery versions: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.js
[14:23:02] <_zoggy_> ok cool, ill let him know
[14:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHA
[14:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> Of all the videos that could be linked at the bottom of the jQuery wikipedia page...
[14:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> Dmitri from 4 years ago :-)
[14:57:40] <_zoggy_> @jzaefferer http://css3pie.com/documentation/getting-started/
[15:23:19] <gnarf> bah
[15:46:10] <_zoggy_> Recently, with the vast majority of our users running at least Lion, we made the decision to no longer support Mac OS X 10.6. We also wanted to make use of the improvements available to developers in OS X 10.7 (Lion) and 10.8 (Mountain Lion).
[15:46:11] <_zoggy_> Therefore, going forward, releases of GitHub for Mac will require an install of at least 10.7 to run. If you are running Snow Leopard, you simply won’t see any new updates and can continue to run your existing version.
