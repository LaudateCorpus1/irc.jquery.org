[03:35:34] <manus> hi folks, just wondering if the build script/process or the download builder might have a minor issue. when selecting "no theme", an image referenced in the progressbar CSS is not included. I'm thinking it probably should be included, either in the built zip or as a data uri in the CSS. Thoughts?
[03:37:07] <manus> (if it's an issue, it's been around since 1.10)
[03:38:00] <manus> (also, since 1.11 dropped support for ie<8, there should be no problem including the data uri)
[04:07:36] <manus> example solution: https://github.com/usmonster/jquery-ui/tree/progressbar-overlay-gif-to-data-uri
[04:09:43] <manus> I can make a pull request if this makes sense as an approach, otherwise the build process might need to be fixed to include that single image (images/animated-overlay.gif) when the progressbar widget is part of a "themeless" build.

[06:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> manus: I could go either way. If you're opting not to have a theme, then you should be designing for the widgets, which would include the progressbar overlay.
[06:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> But I guess you're getting a 404 from the progressbar CSS.
[06:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> Which obviously shouldn't happen.
[06:24:26] <manus> scott_gonzalez: should I file a bug/make a PR, in that case? my only concerns with the uri approach is that it makes the css bigger, and I don't know if you have target sizes for different assets. though you would know if this was an issue.
[06:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not convinced it's a bug. The 404 is the only real issue, and as I've said you should be designing for the widget, which would include overriding that rule.
[06:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely a tricky situation.
[06:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> You can file a bug and get input from the rest of the team.
[06:27:41] <manus> scott_gonzalez: ok, will do

[08:50:52] <tj_vantoll> I unfortunately need to miss the meeting today because of a conflicting meeting.
[08:54:11] <tj_vantoll> I'll be back later today.
[09:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> I think today is going to be a short meeting anyway.
[09:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we get into web components discussions :-P

[11:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> I really can't tell what happened with this datepicker branch, but we can't even merge master into the existing datepicker branch.
[11:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> I will once again suggest killing the history.
[11:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> What would really be the best is to manually curate the history, but that will be very time consuming.
[11:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'll try to curate the history and see how painful this is...

[13:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> Bah. I just manually fixed conflicts in 35 commits and neither jzaefferer nor tj_vantoll are on right now...
[13:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, after this set of commits, I'm willing to spend the time to curate and fix the history.
[13:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't want to be the sole decision maker on how the history is curated.
[14:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this is the datepicker branch rebased: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui/tree/datepicker-rebase
[14:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to squash some of that and then move on to the new commits from the PR.
[14:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Perhaps we can do that in the morning?
