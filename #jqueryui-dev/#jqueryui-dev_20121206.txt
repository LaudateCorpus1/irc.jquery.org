[05:14:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess one option would be to just discuss via email.

[05:28:02] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Not really sure what to say on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8882.  I can see where he's coming from but that seems like a slippery slope and a ton of work.
[05:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I was hoping mikesherov would chime in on that one.
[05:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> I hate subpixels with a passion.
[05:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> Boris Zbarsky thinks we should be using floats everywhere.
[05:29:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: why? you don't like how browsers change their subpixel impl with every release?
[05:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> How much insane code have we written for subpixels?
[05:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I lost months of my life to them.
[05:30:43] <kborchers> WAY too much
[05:31:44] <tj_vantoll> I'm curious how floating everything helps subpixel issues.
[05:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: heh, not CSS float, numeric floats.
[05:32:40] <tj_vantoll> Oh, duh.
[05:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[05:32:54] <scott_gonzalez> I probably could've made that clearer.
[05:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Like "Boris thinks we shouldn't round anywherE"
[05:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> I wish I could find this ticket.
[05:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> "boris pixel" and "zbarsky pixel" return 0 results in trac.
[05:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> And "bz" is apparently too short of a search term trac.
[05:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you remember the ticket I'm thinking of?
[05:37:37] <DaveMethvin> are you talking about fractional pixels scott_gonzalez?
[05:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:37:44] <DaveMethvin> WELL STOP IT
[05:37:46] <DaveMethvin> :D
[05:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't Boris chime in on a core ticket?
[05:37:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah, lemme find it
[05:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> Searching for bzbarsky on core's trac gives me 0 results
[05:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> Found it: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9628
[05:39:09] <DaveMethvin> right
[05:59:18] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I think mergeatron might be submitting a retest on every PR comment.
[06:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> There are currently 6 queued test runs for Krinkle's ajax-unit PR.
[06:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> All from the past hour.
[06:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> Last commit on that PR was yesterday morning. And no manual requests for a retest.

[07:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> Who knew there would be 41 bytes in progressbar?
[07:11:22] <kborchers> nice!
[07:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Check out the change I made for _setOption()/_setOptions().
[07:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only important change in terms of how we structure code.
[07:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> Functions that act on multiple options, like _refreshValue() belong in _setOptions() to avoid multiple invocations.
[07:12:56] <kborchers> oh, that makes sense. cool!
[07:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing missing from the tests at this point is verifying that classes are added/removed at the correct times.
[07:33:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i love when it looks like people go out of their way to remove spaces and change " to ' :-/
[07:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's really annoying.
[08:36:25] <gnarf> jzaefferer: are you around?
[08:36:37] <jzaefferer> gnarf: here, kind of
[08:36:56] <gnarf> jzaefferer: do you know how to edit the browser sets in swarm? can you add ie7 and safari 6 back?
[08:37:16] <jzaefferer> kborchers: "go out of their way" is such a weird construction. It always sounds to me like someone saying "I could care less", when they meant to say "I couldn't care less"
[08:37:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, I think I do
[08:37:34] <jzaefferer> lemme check and share
[08:37:49] <jzaefferer> ssh to jq03
[08:37:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: cool - nakul said there was a corrupt ie7 image that he fixed, and the safari 6 problem should be fixed too
[08:38:11] <jzaefferer> nice
[08:38:16] <gnarf> now there is a new ie8 issue
[08:38:26] <gnarf> "Error Connecting to Server" is all you see 
[08:38:29] <jzaefferer> cd /var/www/swarm/config
[08:38:33] <gnarf> after the first test
[08:39:15] <jzaefferer> then edit localSettings.json, the browserSets entry
[08:39:16] <gnarf> localSettings.json ?
[08:39:18] <gnarf> k
[08:39:53] <jzaefferer> adding them back
[08:40:29] <gnarf> lemme know and I'm gonna fire off git builds for core and ui just to tes
[08:40:39] <jzaefferer> or not
[08:40:44] <jzaefferer> apparently my ssh session crashed
[08:40:45] <jzaefferer> or something
[08:40:49] <gnarf> k
[08:40:52] <gnarf> ill edit it then
[08:40:53] <jzaefferer> vim is unresponsive
[08:40:54] <gnarf> im already here :)
[08:40:59] <jzaefferer> look for the debug entry
[08:41:07] <jzaefferer> has the values for IE7 and Safari 6
[08:42:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i know what you mean on the could/couldn't care less thing but "go out of their way" isn't that weird IMO. maybe if i swapped that with "make and effort", does that make more sense to you?
[08:42:37] <kborchers> s/and/an
[08:42:50] <jzaefferer> wat
[08:43:19] <jzaefferer> "make an effort" makes sense, yeah
[08:43:33] <kborchers> :)
[08:43:34] <jzaefferer> how does "go out of their way" mean the same?
[08:43:44] <jzaefferer> where did that come from?
[08:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> go out of their way = they had to do something extra (diverge from their main path)
[08:44:38] <kborchers> taking a more complicated path requires more effort than staying on the straight path thus, 
[08:44:42] <kborchers> what scott_gonzalez said :)
[08:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> So in the given context, the guy was adding handling for the left positioning.
[08:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> He went out of his way (diverged from setting the left position), to break the formatting of the top positioning.
[08:45:32] <gnarf> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go_out_of_one's_way jzaefferer
[08:47:08] <gnarf> it's a pretty common phrase
[08:51:12] <gnarf> just me, or is there a lint error in master?
[08:51:26] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/3l0b0n423g2z
[08:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That's my fault.
[08:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid datepicker tests don't run lint :-/
[08:55:43] <gnarf> fix both problems? :)

[08:57:57] <gnarf> um
[08:58:00] <gnarf> question

[08:58:08] <kborchers> yo
[08:58:23] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/f7614706abfdbc653de53fbc31361f9aacab8821/ui/jquery.ui.progressbar.js#L105
[08:58:30] <gnarf> if the min is 20 and max is 100
[08:58:44] <gnarf> 60 is still 60% not 50% ?
[08:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Good catch.
[08:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> We don't support changing the min though.
[08:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> But we should fix that.
[09:00:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fix it how? if the min can't be changed then it's always val/max * 100 no?
[09:00:35] <gnarf> if min is always 0 that is true
[09:00:42] <gnarf> so then thats fine
[09:01:10] <gnarf> 100 * ( this.options.value - this.options.min ) / ( this.options.max - this.options.min ) otherwise
[09:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: We use `this.min` in other places in case someone changes it.
[09:01:41] <kborchers> ok, fine :P
[09:02:02] <gnarf> well "min" isn't an option either
[09:02:06] <kborchers> right
[09:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Testing meeting?

[09:27:04] <kborchers> damn you DaveMethvin for your logic :P

[09:33:19] <kborchers> i am tempted to just remove that sanity check. scott_gonzalez jzaefferer thoughts? it's that or check for a 0 denominator first
[09:33:43] <jzaefferer> What happens when it goes about 100?
[09:33:51] <jzaefferer> Or above max?
[09:34:34] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that menubar PR is a good usecase for a whitespace validator
[09:35:09] <jzaefferer> maybe we can just hack together a grunt task with some regex instead of using an actual parser? Just to look for a few common cases?
[09:36:26] <kborchers> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/9deb71b71382e40a204bd50efeda2ace5b092932/ui/jquery.ui.progressbar.js#L81
[09:39:29] <jzaefferer> kborchers: what happens if _percentage returns 110?
[09:39:38] <jzaefferer> will it show as 100%?
[09:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: How would that happen?
[09:44:15] <jzaefferer> when that clamping is removed?
[09:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> A zero denominator means the progressbar is useless.
[09:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's fine.
[09:50:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so just leave as is?
[09:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> I would.
[09:51:18] <kborchers> hmmm
[09:51:29] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: how complex do you want jQuery to be? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8888
[09:51:52] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if i want to try that at all for 1.9 jzaefferer
[09:52:12] <DaveMethvin> if you run master with those settings ... well, let's just say it's not pretty
[09:53:05] <DaveMethvin> i would hate to set the bar high enough so that core 1.9 could pass, perhaps with minor changes, and then hold everything else to that low standard going forward
[09:53:49] <jzaefferer> yeah, that doesn't seem usefu
[09:53:51] <jzaefferer> *useful
[09:54:10] <jzaefferer> only ensures that things don't get worse then they already are
[09:54:25] <DaveMethvin> for 2.0 i want to put this in with some lower limits
[09:54:48] <DaveMethvin> so we could have two different levels i suppose
[09:55:20] <DaveMethvin> but if we're aiming for a projects-wide standard i wouldn't want to make it high enough so that core 1.9 would pass :D
[09:56:08] <jzaefferer> when will development for 2.0 start?
[09:56:31] <DaveMethvin> we are hoping to have a beta 1.9 next week, and branch off 1.9 the following week
[09:56:37] <DaveMethvin> then 2.0 work will begin in master
[09:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: What numbers would you want if you only cared about 2.0?
[09:58:16] <DaveMethvin> the ones in that ticket seem pretty liberal, i'd be okay with them i think
[10:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm getting 0 failures with those limits.
[10:01:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: are you running up-to-date grunt/jshint?
[10:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> oh, duh, I only put them in the root .jshintrc.
[10:01:38] <jzaefferer> or that :p
[10:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok, putting that in /ui/.jshintrc gives errors :-P

[11:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> Tim Caswell <3 lua
[11:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, this function is too complex: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tabs.js#L146
[11:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't think it should be changed.
[11:03:11] <DaveMethvin> that looks like a good application for a switch, actually
[11:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> key codes are the only place we use switches.
[11:03:46] <DaveMethvin> so can we override these settings selectively, like with comments?
[11:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> Per file or per function?
[11:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> Per function would be nice.
[11:04:07] <DaveMethvin> it seems a shame to put them at the project's collective  high water mark
[11:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously we can do it per file.
[11:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> right
[11:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nice you CAN set per-function options.

[12:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that gets us part of the way there.
[12:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> Not surprisingly it's interactions + datepicker that are left.
[12:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> And one effect has one failure.
[12:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> And it finally pushed me far enough to remove $.ui.isOver() and $.ui.isOverAxis().

[13:24:20] <gnarf> agcolom: just don't evaluate jquery core...
[13:25:42] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: I used to love drawing the paths, etc... now I just scream when I see level 4 Java lecturers give code examples with tons of if statements instead of if/else if...
[13:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone around that wants to review a message about why the new input types suck for building JS widgets?
[13:26:18] <gnarf> sure
[13:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the message that was just sent: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-December/038278.html
[13:27:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: if it's just about whether it is easy to understand, I'm your girl! If it's to do with the correctness of stuff I do not understand/know, then best to ask someone else...
[13:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> Here's what I've gotten written up: https://gist.github.com/4228641
[13:34:35] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is there a word missing here: A few weeks ago, support for landed in Chrome Canary
[13:34:53] <agcolom> (after support)?
[13:35:06] <agcolom> sorry, after support for
[13:36:23] <tj_vantoll> Interesting.  I'll have to take a look at that later tonight; I have some thoughts on the matter.  I'm out for the day though.
[13:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: fixed, it was <input type="week/month"> but the markdown parser stripped it.
[13:38:29] <agcolom> great!
[13:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom gnarf: Anything to add or should I send it?
[13:40:07] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: one more 
[13:41:39] <agcolom> and as things are right now, all we can do is say no. -> Maybe better to say and with the way things are right now, all we can do is say no. (but not 100% sure... may be ok as is... just thought would be good to double check with you...)
[13:41:46] <agcolom> (last sentence
[13:42:38] <agcolom> or maybe: We get a lot of requests for jQuery UI widgets to work on the new input types. However, as things are right now, all we can do is say no.
[13:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, I changed it to the last one.
[13:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> gonna send
[13:44:40] <agcolom> Excellent :-)
[13:45:43] * scott_gonzalez rolls eyes
[13:45:58] <agcolom> I can't see the last change...
[13:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> I got an auto-reply from the guy who started the thread saying he doesn't use that email address any more.
[13:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I didn't update the gist.
[13:46:25] <agcolom> oh ok! 
[14:14:03] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so you rolling your eyes, was that for that auto-reply email?
