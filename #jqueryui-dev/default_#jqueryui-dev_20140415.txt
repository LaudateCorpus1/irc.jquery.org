[05:11:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Welcome back! Sweeeeet!
[05:12:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks!
[05:16:19] <_|Nix|_> I had a thought during this morning,s meeting: For any given style option, the way we remove it from one widget should be as similar as possible to the way we remove it from another widget. That way, we minimize the difference between implementations.
[05:16:39] <_|Nix|_> ... and so the instructions for each widget will be similar.
[05:17:52] <_|Nix|_> ... and BTW: We held the meeting on #jquery-meeting :+1:
[05:18:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great
[05:18:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I saw the log
[05:19:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what different ways of removing a style option did you have in mind?
[05:20:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking for example the no-corners class: Making it work for two different widgets is as simple as adding another selector to an existing rule (namely: border-radius: 0;)
[05:22:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: negation classes if we are going to make them should be generic
[05:22:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't get it ... the no-corner class will be added for convenience and won't be widget specific
[05:22:46] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[05:23:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hey
[05:23:35] <uGoMobi> we will just add one rule .ui-corner-false { border-radius: 0; }
[05:23:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but, for example in the case of collapsible you need to add some selectors, because it's not simply the outermost element.
[05:23:42] <uGoMobi> or whatever the class name will be
[05:24:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't inner elements inherit?
[05:24:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on collapsible dont they inherit
[05:24:28] <arschmitz> yeah what uGoMobi said lol
[05:24:30] <uGoMobi> echo echo
[05:24:31] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:25:36] <_|Nix|_> I'm on a phone right now, but I do believe ui-corner-all shows up in multiple selectors in our current css, right?
[05:26:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that selector is only used once I think
[05:26:21] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/search?l=css&q=ui-corner-all&ref=cmdform
[05:26:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool search!
[05:27:21] <arschmitz> code search filtered by document language
[05:27:45] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:28:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's just it. For each of those hits we'll have to have the corresponding no-corners rule.
[05:28:03] <uGoMobi> ok, so there are some other rules we need to check
[05:28:10] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[05:28:36] <uGoMobi> but I think in most or all cases it will negate the border radius
[05:28:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: many of those are inherit
[05:28:50] <arschmitz> which is fine
[05:29:01] <uGoMobi> or inherit indeed
[05:29:10] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/f507eb6fa152eb1d2aa0692bdc749af73bcb0298/css/structure/jquery.mobile.collapsible.css#L63
[05:29:26] <arschmitz> and many of them already set it to zero so it does not matter anyway
[05:29:34] <uGoMobi> exactly
[05:29:51] <arschmitz> so i think the generic rule will fix 90% of those
[05:30:01] <arschmitz> and we will just add selectors for remaining
[05:30:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you are right that we need to check these things (not only for corner style)
[05:30:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. corners is just one of the options.
[05:31:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: maybe we should mention to the guys from samsung to do a search like this one for each options as they do it
[05:31:04] <_|Nix|_> ... and since ths is a css-centric operation, we might want to implement things one style option at a time.
[05:31:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[05:31:18] <arschmitz> to make sure they are properly handling each case 
[05:34:19] <_|Nix|_> Cool! I'll write it up in an email.
[05:34:37] <agcolom> Hi all, just a quick message... I saw an article yesterday, and I found the idea of the circle picker really interesting. I don't have an android device, so havent seen that for real, but I thought it would be nice to have a circle and/or a double radius circle picker as JQM widget? What do you think? The article was https://medium.com/thoughts-and-words/4a172c2c5428
[05:35:25] <agcolom> it could be as a pcker or maybe a circle slider?
[05:35:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I've already written one with 3 sliders.
[05:35:58] <agcolom> oops ;-)
[05:36:25] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: you mean a triple radius circle?
[05:36:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://web-ui-fw.github.io/#colorwidgets-demo
[05:36:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Check out the hue/sat/val picker.
[05:37:28] <agcolom> In this case it's as a circle. Not a color picker, a circle picker
[05:37:47] <agcolom> where you have for example the time around a circle
[05:38:50] <agcolom> as in the second example on https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1200/1*HihwTsZ1a6LcXLY1Q4ePaw.png
[05:41:24] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[05:41:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Designs for color pickers abound. The only downside of a really nice one is that you have to update a lot of DOM in response to mouse movement, which makes it slow.
[05:42:20] <agcolom> hi uGoMobi, nice to see you back online :-)
[05:42:29] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[05:42:40] <uGoMobi> so happy
[05:42:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Try the ones at http://web-ui-fw.github.io/#colorwidgets-demo on a mobile device.
[05:43:22] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I meant more something like http://baijs.com/tinycircleslider/
[05:44:40] <uGoMobi> I remember one from Tyler Benzinger his preso in San Diego
[05:44:50] <agcolom> but only as a form widget to pick values
[05:46:00] <agcolom> (either for time or anything else that makes sense on having on a slider with min/max with step as an option
[05:46:31] <uGoMobi> http://tybenz.com/presentation-js-legos/#/15
[05:47:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The way to reduce DOM manip is to have a preview. Then the sliders/circles/whatever can be static and you only need to set the background colour on the p√Éreview.
[05:47:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes
[05:48:57] <agcolom> so something like what Tyler has on that slide would be great to select something
[05:49:19] <agcolom> so select elements based on icons, value, or anything else
[05:49:55] <agcolom> what do you think?
[05:49:58] <uGoMobi> as long as the page can't scroll, otherwise I think you will run into issues
[05:50:09] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: If we'
[05:50:15] <_|Nix|_> re still talking about colours,
[05:50:24] <_|Nix|_> then you need at least two elements.
[05:50:30] <agcolom> no, it's not about colours :-)
[05:50:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK.
[05:50:39] <uGoMobi> Android only uses it for setting time
[05:50:45] <uGoMobi> as far as I noticed
[05:51:44] <agcolom> it could a menu (you can have more than the five max footer items), or as a selector
[05:52:28] <uGoMobi> http://eskimoblood.github.io/jim-knopf/
[05:53:40] <agcolom> yes, that works also, except that in the case of text/numbers, I'd keep them horizontal
