[11:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: have you tried the updated BrowserStack module yet?

[13:34:19] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: looks like clarkbox is under cover for a day or two; though I bet he's back before gnarf
[13:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: got something for you to approve :-)
[13:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> Changing ._super() back to ._super( method )
[13:34:54] <jzaefferer> oh yeah?
[13:35:04] <jzaefferer> oh?
[13:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's needed for sanity
[13:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> Mine, and all our noob users :-)
[13:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the problem:
[13:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> You include ui.interaction.
[13:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> You include an extension to ui.interaction.
[13:36:30] <jzaefferer> a lil more explanation?
[13:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> You include ui.draggable.
[13:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> Everything works as expected, draggable inherits from the extended interaction
[13:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> But, now let's look at the real world.
[13:37:21] <scott_gonzalez> You include jQuery UI from a CDN
[13:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> You include an extension to ui.interaction.
[13:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> Your extension is useless because nothing is inheriting from it.
[13:38:45] <jzaefferer> Can you define "extension"? Or rather, got an example for the latter case?
[13:39:09] <scott_gonzalez> extension = $.widget( "ui.interaction", $.ui.interaction, { ... })
[13:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> Let's Skype and I'll show you some code.
[14:07:26] <clarkbox> i am around. busy today
[14:07:58] <clarkbox> i finished the browserstack - testswarm integration last night
[14:08:01] <clarkbox> i now keep track of state
[14:08:15] <clarkbox> ill hook the script up to cron today, and have it fire off in 5 min interval
[14:08:57] <clarkbox> there still seems to be issues running some of the tests "headless" in IE. at least just IE6
[14:09:42] <clarkbox> and we can only run 4 simultaneous workers (browsers) at a time in browserstack. even if i round robin requests between accounts.
[14:10:09] <clarkbox> someone let me know where i should commit the code for the integration script
[14:10:50] <jzaefferer> We all need more Bacardi hats: http://bassistance.de/i/ee168f.png
[14:11:45] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: is it just a single script (file)? if so, a TestSwarm branch would be good for now
[14:12:12] <clarkbox> ya its just one script. with some dependencies
[14:12:33] <jzaefferer> can you just gist it for now, for scott_gonzalez and me to take a look?
[14:12:34] <clarkbox> one of which is scott_gonzalez's nodejs browserstack wrapper
[14:12:45] <clarkbox> ya certainly
[14:12:48] <jzaefferer> yeah, Scott had some inquiries about that
[14:12:52] <jzaefferer> but he's now out, drinking
[14:13:02] <jzaefferer> which I'll also join him in, even though I'm very far away
[14:13:05] <clarkbox> ill ping you guys when i have time to get it published some place
[14:13:12] <jzaefferer> cool, thanks!
[14:13:19] <clarkbox> still need to polish it before its ready for consumption
[14:13:29] <clarkbox> but ill get it running for now at least
[14:13:41] <clarkbox> and by now... i mean within 24hrs
[14:14:53] <clarkbox> here is a quick paste for now: http://pastebin.com/VNmTZpC2
[14:15:18] <clarkbox> fyi first time writing anything in node/cli node script... so send across any suggestions/pro tips.
[14:17:25] <clarkbox> one of the main things left to do is use node promise to get rid of the "mutex"
[14:17:46] <jzaefferer> at first glance, looks good
[14:17:52] <jzaefferer> seen a lot worse node code ;)
[14:18:07] <clarkbox> glad to hear!
[14:18:32] <jzaefferer> good next step would be to refactor most of this into a module, and restrict the "main" file to just options and then calling the main module
[14:19:02] <clarkbox> ya, thats on the "roadmap" of this initiative
[14:19:52] <clarkbox> i wanted to abstract things to the point of not assuming both sides of the integration layer... i wanted to keep testswarm stuff out of here. but this is all i have time for now
[14:20:23] <jzaefferer> that's cool
[14:20:56] <jzaefferer> glad to have you working on this, getting us a lot closer to finalizing the automated testing puzzle
[15:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: still around?
[15:43:39] <clarkbox> kinda
[15:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> If you can update the script to use the updated module, that'd be great
[15:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm ready to publish 0.0.1 to npm, but I wanted to make sure you didn't run into any problems with it first.
[15:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> I added .getWorker() and .getWorkers() today.
[15:46:36] <scott_gonzalez> I can also help with the integration once the code is in a repo.
[16:01:44] <clarkbox> sounds good scott
[16:02:02] <clarkbox> been sidetracked the last couple days with work (aka paying the bills)
[16:05:26] <clarkbox> i have no problems besides getWorker and getWorkers. so publish away! :)
[23:20:37] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez you around?
[23:20:45] <clarkbox> did you not update git with latest browserstack?
[23:25:19] <clarkbox> disregard... i see it now.
