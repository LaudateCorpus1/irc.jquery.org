[01:02:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I know, it's a valid fix, but a statement should be separated by a semicolon, not a comma.
[01:02:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I would've thought that would cause the linter or the interpreter to go haywire, but no, it's "Just Fineâ„¢".

[06:10:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: morning
[06:10:40] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:10:49] <arschmitz> something is crazy with panel close
[06:11:01] <arschmitz> it seems to delete random stuff 
[06:11:03] <uGoMobi> yeah there are issues
[06:11:09] <uGoMobi> huh :/
[06:11:30] <uGoMobi> while you are still on the page
[06:11:32] <uGoMobi> ?
[06:12:05] <uGoMobi> I mean, could it be something in the destroy method or not
[06:12:24] <arschmitz> no its not destroy
[06:12:31] <arschmitz> because it happens when you close the panel
[06:12:37] <arschmitz> not navigate or destroy
[06:12:58] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:13:19] <arschmitz> its crazy a fixed header with a n <h1></h1> or similar is fine
[06:13:37] <arschmitz> but remove that and any buttons in the header are deleted
[06:13:39] <uGoMobi> do you have a JS Bin?
[06:13:47] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/117/edit
[06:15:43] <arschmitz> oh never mind
[06:15:59] <arschmitz> i thought this was same as iframe issue yesterday but its not
[06:16:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is because we are setting overflow hidden when panel closes
[06:16:45] <arschmitz> and with no title in the header it has no height
[06:16:59] <uGoMobi> overflow hidden is stricky stuff
[06:17:08] <uGoMobi> I have to look into that
[06:17:24] <uGoMobi> kills stuff on WP8
[06:17:34] <uGoMobi> causes popup issue :(
[06:17:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think this actually is more an issue with header height
[06:17:50] <arschmitz> and not having a min height
[06:18:22] <arschmitz> because to start in bin header is not visible but buttons are because of overflow
[06:18:23] <uGoMobi> yeah was talking in general
[06:18:27] <arschmitz> oh yeah 
[06:18:41] <arschmitz> maybe there we will get a fix with ie11
[06:18:46] <uGoMobi> i added that :empty rule in a bbranch
[06:18:50] <arschmitz> which is out before the end of the year
[06:18:54] <arschmitz> that would not work here
[06:19:03] <arschmitz> its not empty it has buttons
[06:19:04] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:19:48] <uGoMobi> wanted to continue with... maybe we have to add a fix for when there are only buttons
[06:19:55] <arschmitz> lol
[06:19:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:20:41] <uGoMobi> i am working on laptop and macbook now.... two different keyboard sizes is killing my typing lol
[06:21:17] <arschmitz> maybe could do like .ui-header>button:first-child :after { min-height:xx } ?
[06:21:25] <arschmitz> i meant actually 
[06:21:43] <arschmitz> content : <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
[06:21:54] <arschmitz> so basicly inject a header
[06:21:55] <uGoMobi> it is position absolute
[06:22:03] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:22:28] <arschmitz> i think that would work
[06:22:46] <arschmitz> will would have to have rules for button input and a but you get the idea
[06:22:49] <uGoMobi> we use that :after for the icon
[06:23:05] <arschmitz> and i suppose you use before too?
[06:23:24] <uGoMobi> no, :before is free :)
[06:23:34] <arschmitz> ah ok before then lol
[06:24:14] <arschmitz> oh speaking of button i think we need to add back compat to button
[06:24:38] <arschmitz> so that calling button works regardless of what its called on basicly
[06:25:29] <uGoMobi> yeah it's pretty confusing for users
[06:25:36] <uGoMobi> we changed things
[06:25:44] <uGoMobi> and the documentation is wrong
[06:26:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we could just call buttonmarkup and destroy if its a button or link
[06:26:13] <arschmitz> in _create
[06:26:56] <arschmitz> so then calling button will work and even passing an option object will work you just wont be able to call methods 
[06:27:33] <arschmitz> but the only one that would matter to much is refresh which there will be no need for 
[06:30:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: would this be only for 1.4?
[06:30:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[06:30:48] <uGoMobi> ok sounds good
[06:30:57] <uGoMobi> but let's not document it
[06:31:04] <uGoMobi> only how people should use
[06:31:34] <arschmitz> yea should only document the way things are going to be not backcompat ways of doing thins 
[06:32:05] <uGoMobi> I noticed that if you call buttonMarkup on anchar it won't check for data- attributes
[06:32:20] <uGoMobi> so you have to set the options when you call the function
[06:32:24] <arschmitz> nope thats enhanceWithButtonmarkup
[06:32:35] <uGoMobi> I see
[06:32:57] <arschmitz> the only difference is enhanceWith checks data-attributes buttonmarkup does not
[06:33:02] <arschmitz> EVEN MORE CONFUSING!

[07:07:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Sorry about the confusion!
[07:07:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol not a problem
[07:07:45] <arschmitz> just something we need to figure out the right way to handle as far as docs
[07:07:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[07:08:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, enhanceWithButtonMarkup should not be public.
[07:08:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you're gonna write javascript to create buttonMarkup, you don't need to store the options in data-attributes.
[07:08:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but did old ButtonMarkup read data- attributes
[07:08:47] <arschmitz> i dont remember
[07:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lessee ...
[07:09:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're right.
[07:09:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It did.
[07:09:54] <arschmitz> yeah which means we need to make it work for backcompat
[07:09:55] <arschmitz>  :(
[07:10:18] <arschmitz> thats ok i need to add to button widget to call button markup if not being called on a div too
[07:10:33] <arschmitz> i mean not being called on an input
[07:10:55] <arschmitz> because before you could call it on anything you wanted button link div whatever
[07:10:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... OK ... good point, however, we must deprecate it.
[07:11:02] <arschmitz> yup
[07:11:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You still can, but the reading of data-attributes must be deprecated.
[07:11:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That is, you only specify data-attributes if you expect enhancement to happen via autoinit.
[07:12:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i mean in button widget i need to add to _create if( !input ) this.element.buttonMarkup( this.options ); this.destroy();
[07:12:35] <arschmitz> because before it could be called on anything not it cant
[07:12:46] <_|Nix|_>  arschmitz So, this particular sequence becomes deprecated: $( "<div data-role='button' data-inline='true' data-corners='true'></div>" ).buttonMarkup();
[07:13:03] <arschmitz> yea
[07:13:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I have an idea as to how we should handle the backcompat.
[07:15:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whats that?
[07:15:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the ui-btn class is already present then I don't check data-attributes.
[07:15:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry I kept you waiting :) I was checking the code to make sure my idea was possible.
[07:15:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have a function that parses classes on the element and returns alreadyEnhanced: true/false depending on whether it finds the ui-btn class.
[07:16:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The price is that we will check data-attributes even if all the options are specified.
[07:16:54] <arschmitz> yeah i mean if its what we gotta do thats just how it is it will go away in 1.5
[07:17:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although maybe we can check data-attributes only for those options not collected from the classes and the passed-in options.
[07:18:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, it need not go away if we do it that way, because after the first call to buttonMarkup, theoretically no data-* option will be checked again, because the option value will be recovered from the classes attached during the previous call.
[07:19:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and if you specify all options you will get zero attribute checks.
[07:19:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and you can specify all options by doing .buttonMarkup( $.extend( {}, $.fn.buttonMarkup.defaults, { corners: false, theme: "b" } );
[07:20:05] <_|Nix|_> ^H);
[07:20:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, it's a matter of being performance-aware.
[07:20:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:21:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I'll make the change.

[08:42:48] <uGoMobi> np, thanks for adding the changelogs
[08:43:41] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: My opinion is every change in interactions is a breaking change.
[08:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I'd be find closing it with something like "Unfortunately every change in events seems to cause regressions for a portion of users. Until we can have full test coverage, we're not comfortable changing the behavior."
[08:46:12] <tj_vantoll> Ok. In this case this is absolutely a bug and a regression, so I'd be comfortable landing a fix for that with tests. It will nearly certainly cause other regressions, but at least we're one test closer.
[08:46:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agcolom _|Nix|_ gseguin RWhitbeck toddmparker frequent  : agenda doc for todays meeting https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kg0RDJ4hgRR8SgmTelg0btWyZG4XEI-ogvucq5Hjq7I/edit?usp=sharing
[08:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Well, if it's a regression, can we track down the commit where we regressed?
[08:48:17] <tj_vantoll> We already have: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/07ce771a13504b851bb9f74c8ce8e960d207384a
[08:48:18] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: John Chen (5mon 1w ago): Sortable: Skip triggering over event if it's alreay over the continer. Fixes #9041: the over event fires on every pixel movement
[08:48:53] <tj_vantoll> Which of course, fixed a different regression :-P
[08:50:21] <agcolom> uGoMobi: this one will take a lot longer but should look really good! (the changelog) 
[08:51:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom: is converting the links from HTML to MD that is time consuming?
[08:51:57] <uGoMobi> s/is/is it/
[08:52:24] <agcolom> yes! Also I want to do it just like it is in UI... so it's just the sort of stuff I love doing...
[08:52:48] <agcolom> (perfect while trying to sunbathe at the same time!)
[08:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: To be honest, I was just letting mikesherov use his best judgement on those.
[08:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll let you do the same :-)
[08:54:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am happy you enjoy it :)
[08:54:12] <agcolom> :-)
[08:55:26] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: close it if you disagree with the change, or if we want the change, and the contributor can't contribute a test
[08:55:33] <mikesherov> I support you closing it
[08:56:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: found that android class name BTW: .ui-android-2x-fixed .ui-li-has-thumb { }
[08:57:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it's for that fixed toolbar issue
[08:57:10] <arschmitz> ohhh thats part of workarounds isnt it
[08:57:22] <arschmitz> i hate that extension lol
[08:57:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it is in the CSS but add by the workaround JS yes
[08:57:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thing is... ui-li-has-thumb is no longer added
[08:58:01] <arschmitz> sweet!
[08:58:22] <uGoMobi> well, that means the fix won't work anymore
[08:58:22] <arschmitz> not sure if that means a regression or alternative fix though lol
[08:58:28] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:58:46] <arschmitz> i hate regressions that cant be tested in tests :(
[08:58:50] <arschmitz> stupid css lol
[08:58:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have to check what the issue was that is fixed by this
[08:59:18] <arschmitz> click through on fixed navbars that overlap thumbnails
[08:59:33] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:59:34] <arschmitz> if i recall
[09:00:00] <arschmitz> it had to do with particular combination of thumb css with navbar css
[09:00:10] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:00:25] <arschmitz> been a long time since i wrote that extension lol
[09:00:25] <uGoMobi> the fix is 3D the li with thumb
[09:00:34] <arschmitz> yup
[09:00:47] <uGoMobi> so let's see if that is an issue again
[09:00:58] <uGoMobi> if not we can remove it all together :)
[09:01:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah have to test it because you have changed whole listview structure
[09:01:20] <arschmitz> so that may have fixed it already
[09:01:20] <uGoMobi> yes I did :)
[09:01:34] <arschmitz> fingers crossed
[09:01:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you open an issue for that and assign me so i dont forget
[09:02:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[09:02:26] <arschmitz> thanks
[09:07:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have to correct myself... we still add that class "ui-li-has-thumb" but deprecated it. In 1.4 we no longer add class "ui-li-thumb" to the image itself, but that isn't relevant here.
[09:07:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: still worth testing if we still need it :)
[09:07:33] <arschmitz> ok

[11:53:56] <uGoMobi> hi godswearhats 
[11:54:46] <godswearhats> Hello!
[11:55:11] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: hello! great that you want to help
[11:55:38] <godswearhats> :-)
[11:55:43] <godswearhats> I have an ulterior motive ...
[11:56:14] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: tell me
[11:56:18] <godswearhats> I wrote a jquery.ui.rotatable and I want to learn enough to get that included the main jquery-ui (I know it has a long way to go in terms of features / robustness).
[11:56:41] <godswearhats> So I figure this is a good way to get started.
[11:57:08] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: right, although the meeting you just joined was the jQuery Mobile team
[11:57:11] <godswearhats> Firmly believe that in 5 years the only people who will own computers are software developers. Everything else will be tablet / phone.
[11:57:14] <godswearhats> Yep.
[11:57:15] <godswearhats> I know :-)
[11:57:25] <godswearhats> I don't think you can easily separate the two for success.
[11:57:26] <uGoMobi> jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI share same -dev channel
[11:57:45] <godswearhats> The future of UI dev is on mobile.
[11:58:16] <godswearhats> I understand the difference, don't worry.
[11:58:25] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:58:38] <uGoMobi> the two projects are working closer together
[11:58:42] <godswearhats> My dev skills are rusty and I'm just wanting to jump in to help sharpen the old sword.
[11:58:45] <uGoMobi> that's why we share channel now
[11:58:53] * godswearhats nods. Makes sense.
[11:59:16] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: nice!
[11:59:19] <gseguin> arschmitz: the images in the zip is possible but will require a lot of work
[11:59:33] <gseguin> arschmitz: it would mean that I parse the CSS files
[11:59:43] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: here is that compat file i've been using https://gist.github.com/kborchers/c7014badbbd2f3ae6f1f
[12:00:00] <uGoMobi> hanging out on this -dev channel and the issue tracker is a good start to get involved like arschmitz already mentioned
[12:00:02] <gseguin> or rather the built CSS and figure out the images used
[12:00:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: couldnt we manually specifiy them? 
[12:00:07] <gseguin> then include them in the zip
[12:00:24] <godswearhats> uGoMobi: I've been a dev manager for ~12 years, and a dev before that. Trying to get back to being more hands on.
[12:00:33] * gseguin doesn't like manual things
[12:00:34] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: cool!
[12:00:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: +1
[12:00:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i agree but if you dont have the time right now 
[12:00:55] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:00:58] <godswearhats> So, this is what I was looking at - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=20&page=1&state=open
[12:01:10] <arschmitz> its a much quicker fix for 1.4 and relook at after
[12:01:24] <gseguin> arschmitz: both manual and parsing the CSS would require dev time
[12:01:48] <gseguin> because by manual I'm guessing you're referring to a metadata comment
[12:01:55] <arschmitz> no
[12:01:57] <gseguin> the same way we do css files today, correct?
[12:02:04] <arschmitz> no
[12:02:08] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: because we are all working on 1.4 issues now it will be good to check here on -dev if someone is already working on a ticket
[12:02:16] <godswearhats> OK.
[12:02:21] <gseguin> oh you mean hard code?
[12:02:31] <arschmitz> yup
[12:02:33] <arschmitz> just for now
[12:02:41] <godswearhats> OK - I'll fork the code and poke around for a bit.
[12:02:43] <arschmitz> untill you have time to make it parse
[12:02:48] <gseguin> hmm... don't like that either
[12:02:58] <godswearhats> Right now, I'm working on a FreeBSD port for a command line tool, but I'll take a look at this later today or tomorrow.

[12:03:15] <godswearhats> uGoMobi: Yeah, makes sense :-)
[12:03:24] <gseguin> which is point the user at a zip of the images depending on the version selected
[12:03:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: i thought you had them included in zip now?
[12:03:44] <gseguin> nope
[12:03:46] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: awesome, thanks a lot!
[12:04:05] <arschmitz> oh ok for some reason i thought you had done that in that case yeah just do it old way
[12:04:15] <gseguin> check the "images" link at the bottom of the page
[12:04:24] <gseguin> I need to updated it for 1.4
[12:05:15] <arschmitz> gseguin: wait a sec we are talking about different things lol
[12:05:26] <arschmitz> im not talking about the builder
[12:05:38] <gseguin> huh ?
[12:05:41] <arschmitz> im talking about the build like the zip generated by the build script
[12:05:49] <gseguin> oh !

[12:06:05] <arschmitz> its missing the images
[12:06:16] <gseguin> oh ! ok

[12:06:23] <arschmitz> lol ok
[12:06:32] <godswearhats> uGoMobi: Is there a branch I should fork from, other than master?

[12:07:31] <godswearhats> OK.
[12:07:48] <godswearhats> (Stuff is compiling on my FreeBSD VM, so I have time to look at this now)
[12:08:53] <godswearhats> Is there a wiki page I should look at before I start poking around in the code?

[13:32:23] <gseguin> the zips produced by the builder have never included icons
[13:32:30] <arschmitz> right
[13:33:00] <agcolom> ok. I was worried I had to change the ones I just uploaded to the new site ;-) 
[13:33:13] <agcolom> so I'll just have to upload the 1.4 alpha then.
[13:33:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah
[13:33:24] <agcolom> I mean change the 1.4 alpha
[13:33:43] <agcolom> but that's not ready yet, is that correct?
[13:34:06] <gseguin> not ready indeed

[14:23:00] <b-ot> godswearhats: Issue #5973 by radiallogic (2mon 3w ago): Checkbox and label different select state
[14:23:14] <godswearhats> Oh, there's a bot :-)
[14:23:21] <godswearhats> Another bot.
[14:23:54] <godswearhats> Yeah, that one. I'm able to reproduce. Is it common practice to write a failing test then make it pass (TDD/BDD style)?
[14:24:56] <arschmitz> feel free
[14:25:20] <arschmitz> as far as your approach to it thats up to you
[14:25:44] <arschmitz> but you should write a test to prevent future regressions when you fix the bug
[14:25:49] <arschmitz> if possible

[14:33:07] <godswearhats> arschmitz: thanks. Looks like there is a unit test for it already that passes :-(
[14:33:12] <godswearhats> I'll keep digging.
[14:34:09] <arschmitz> remember if its platform specific unit tests wont help unless you run them on that device 
[14:34:19] <godswearhats> Yeah, I'm running it on my iPhone.
[14:34:28] <godswearhats> I think I misunderstood the unit test.
[14:34:39] <godswearhats> It's fine - as long as I'm good to work on the bug, I'll keep going.
[14:35:03] <arschmitz> yea go for it
[15:15:57] <Danwe_WMDE> I want to use jQuery.fn.animate() in a widget, before the animation starts, I want to trigger an event bubbling up the dom, saying an animation is going to start, allowing to listen to the different animation callbacks (step, done, etc.). I didn't see a convenient way to do this, did I miss something?

[19:14:52] <kborchers> wow
[19:25:53] <DaveMethvin> hey kborchers, so did you have a good time?
[19:26:10] <DaveMethvin> your wife lets you out of the house?
[19:26:50] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: so we ended up not doing dinner, but i did get out of the house. took the older son to the park for a bit. it was nice
[19:27:01] <DaveMethvin> well good
[19:27:06] <DaveMethvin> it has to be better than pointer events
[19:27:24] <kborchers> yeah, a just a bit :)
[19:27:37] <DaveMethvin> so i was thinking about this during the dog walk, it might be trickier than I first thouhgt
[19:27:48] <DaveMethvin> i do my best thinking during dog walks
[19:28:02] <DaveMethvin> i should feed the dog more so he has to poop more
[19:28:06] <kborchers> :D
[19:55:12] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: yeah, this is hurting my head a bit :P
[19:55:47] <DaveMethvin> i'd gladly trade with you if you want to do budget :)
[19:55:54] <kborchers> haha
[19:56:32] <DaveMethvin> btw kborchers richard called me earlier today and said his wife's water broke so they're off to the hospital
[19:56:51] <DaveMethvin> i'm losing count on his kids
[19:56:57] <kborchers> wow
[19:57:17] <kborchers> yeah, he's at like 73 or so right?
[19:57:40] <kborchers> ;)
[19:57:51] <DaveMethvin> plus or minus
[19:58:11] <DaveMethvin> the trick is to get the older ones to take care of the younger i guess
[19:58:25] <kborchers> maybe it just sounded like that many the other day on the call when they got back from the pool :)
[19:58:32] <kborchers> heh, exactly
[19:58:32] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:59:17] <kborchers> well, good for them hope all goes well
[20:00:02] <DaveMethvin> his wife has lots of practice so it shoudl be fine
[20:00:07] <kborchers> lol
