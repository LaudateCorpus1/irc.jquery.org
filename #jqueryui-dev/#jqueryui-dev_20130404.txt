[06:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I was thinking about the classes option some more.
[06:53:38] <tj_vantoll> ok
[06:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> "If the CSS classes were mixed in via a preprocessor, the user would have to do something akin to .ui-button, .ui-datepicker, .ui-dialog, etc to accomplish the same thing.  The file size will go up as well as the rules will have to be copied into each widget."
[06:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> 2 things about that.
[06:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Aren't pre-processors smart enough to just duplicate the selector, not the properties?
[06:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> So the increased file size is fairly small.
[06:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Plus it's eaten by gzip and cached.
[06:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> 2) At the point that this becomes a standard and we don't use pre-processors, the increased size from expansion goes away.
[06:55:26] <tj_vantoll> The size concern is definitely a very minor one.
[06:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like "A CSS preprocessor will also not help to replace options such as dialogClass & tooltipClass as those will need to declaratively listed on a per instance basis." is the only real concern.
[06:56:27] <tj_vantoll> .ui-corner-all { border-radius: 5px; }
[06:56:27] <tj_vantoll> .ui-dialog { .ui-corner-all; }
[06:57:33] <tj_vantoll> SASS has the concept of silent classes, LESS does not to my knowledge.
[06:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> What's a silent class?
[06:59:00] <tj_vantoll> .ui-corner-all wouldn't appear in the outputted CSS.  It would only be a class that would be mixed into other selectors.
[06:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[06:59:41] <tj_vantoll> My point though is that let's say for theming you want to style .ui-widget-content a certain way.
[07:00:03] <tj_vantoll> We could mix the default .ui-widget-content CSS rules via a preprocessor.
[07:00:44] <tj_vantoll> But if we no longer are applying the .ui-widget-content class in JS the ability to globally theme widgets using that class goes away.
[07:01:20] <tj_vantoll> A user cannot do .ui-corner-all { border-color: red; } and have it hit all widgets.
[07:02:05] <tj_vantoll> Does that make sense?
[07:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think all of our classes would continue to exist.
[07:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes the classes option tricky.
[07:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> As you pointed out.
[07:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> Becuase we still want ui-widget/ui-widget-content to be applied.
[07:03:31] <tj_vantoll> Right so you even with the preprocessor you still need to manually manage those classes in JS.
[07:03:45] <tj_vantoll> The point of the classes option is to make that easier.
[07:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> back in a bit, on a call

[08:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds promising.
[08:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> We went over every thing we do in our build process and download builder.
[08:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> She wants to build a service that works like the rails pipeline but in node.
[08:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> And it would be smart like Make, not dumb like Grunt.
[08:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> In that it would only rebuild what it needs.
[08:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> And track dependencies across tasks/files.

[09:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> me too :-)
[09:08:13] <toddmparker> hi all
[09:08:23] <toddmparker> hear there's some cool preprocessor talk
[09:08:43] <toddmparker> jzaefferer: you back?
[09:08:57] <jzaefferer> toddmparker: yes, I'm back
[09:08:57] <b-ot> jzaefferer: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:08:58] <bot-t> (7 hours 31 mins ago) <kborchers> tell jzaefferer i am finally in your timezone and you're not online :P
[09:12:21] <toddmparker> aw, meeting
[09:12:35] <toddmparker> i want to catch up later on the pre-processor stuff
[12:37:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzales: you around?
[12:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: hey
[13:00:23] * scott_gonzalez doesn't get notified of misspellings ;-)
[13:00:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: toddmparker wanted me to go over some stuff with you when you have time
[13:00:53] <arschmitz> oh shoot sorry about that
[13:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> What kind of stuff?
[13:01:15] <arschmitz> just a document i wrote up
[13:01:27] <arschmitz> with some standards for JQM widgets / JS in general
[13:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> Got a link?
[13:01:40] <arschmitz> see if you had anny sugestions additions etc
[13:01:45] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[13:02:20] <arschmitz> we really want to get more inline with you guys 
[13:04:56] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: this is kinda my first pass at documenting some JQM standards
[13:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Overall this looks good :-)
[13:16:55] <arschmitz> Thank you saw your comments and have a couple questions
[13:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to ask here or comment on my comments or start a devs-team thread or whatever :-)
[13:18:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: with pseudo selector
[13:18:47] <arschmitz> i was specificly referring to like a dialog and wanting to close other ones first so do $(":dialog").dialog("close"); or something
[13:19:25] <arschmitz> is :data( still better?
[13:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> If you're inside the dialog widge, either is fine.
[13:20:17] <arschmitz> ok thats specificly what i was refering to is from inside a widget
[13:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find an example where it woudl break.
[13:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L553
[13:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> If that used the widget-specific selector, it would throw an error if the resizable widget wasn't loaded.
[13:21:01] <arschmitz> ah ok good to know
[13:21:07] <arschmitz> makes sense 
[13:21:45] <arschmitz> ok for $.data vs $.fn.data isnt $.data always much faster? 
[13:21:52] <arschmitz> we have done a bunch of jsperf on it 
[13:22:03] <arschmitz> which i will need to dig up
[13:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not any more.
[13:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> It was slow because of the data events.
[13:26:33] <arschmitz> hmm was pretty recently after christmas i think
[13:26:37] <arschmitz> but will recheck
[13:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[13:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, .data() does go through jQuery.access().
[13:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> How often are you storing/reading data?
[13:29:44] <arschmitz> depends on the widget right now we have a couple that do quite a bit
[13:31:23] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: commented on a few of your comments
[13:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> replied
[13:35:44] <arschmitz> replied to a couple again :)
[13:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> So, basically just two things.
[13:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> I actually have an example of the min attribute thing.
[13:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.spinner.js#L75
[13:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> We know for sure that this widget is initialized against an input.
[13:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> But this concept should work in Mobile and play nice with the data- attribute parsing that already exists.
[13:41:01] <arschmitz> yeah for sure thank you ill add that in the document
[13:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> You'd just need to _super( "_getCreateOptions" ).
[13:41:24] <arschmitz> yup thats exactly what i was thinking
[13:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> And the elems.length thing....
[13:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> I remember the first time I heard that.
[13:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> I was so mad.
[13:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's an anti-pattern.
[13:43:38] <arschmitz> Good to know
[13:44:12] <arschmitz> something i picked up a long time ago from someone i thought i could trust :) ( see comment )
[13:44:42] <arschmitz> but ill take that off performance list 
[13:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well He Who Shall Not Be Named has publicly apologized for leading the world astray with perf advice :-P
[13:47:32] <arschmitz> lol
[13:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad there's no video.
[13:48:04] <arschmitz> im no longer sure if we are bad guy from harry potter or ....
[13:48:06] <arschmitz> lol
[13:48:59] <arschmitz> Thank you for looking this over i think this will go a long ways towards making our widgets sane and following the same guidelines ui does
[13:49:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: is there anything you can think of thats missing you would add?
[13:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> Our document is mostly empty :-( http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding%20standards
[13:51:15] <arschmitz> like the third bullet point
[13:53:27] <arschmitz> wow are we actually ahead of the game on something for once :)?
[13:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that page has existed forever and I've just never filled it out.
[13:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> Page history goes back to March 24, 2009 at 9:16:16 am :-P
[13:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> You'd think over the course of 4 years it'd actually have some content added...
[14:03:59] <arschmitz> :)
