[05:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: We need to copy this to jquery-simulate: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/24756a978a977d7abbef5e5bce403837a01d964f
[05:44:36] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yup
[05:44:36] <bot-t> (40 hours 10 mins ago) <Dave_Stein> tell mikesherov the draggable helpers need to use position rather than offset because of fixed elements. let me know if you think im wrong but that certainly fixed a bunch of tests
[05:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few other document references.
[05:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably be creating the events from the correct document, right?
[05:45:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes
[05:45:15] <mikesherov> going to be updating simulate today
[05:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll leave it alone then.
[05:46:11] <mikesherov> there are other changes I haven't backported yet
[05:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[05:48:01] <mikesherov> but yeah, there are several more document references in simulate that need to be updated to the element's ownerDocument
[05:54:25] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: did we ever decide in that call what we were going to use to write tests for the pointer stuff? i was going to start writing tests last night but wasn't sure if we were going to use QUnit and simulate the events or what.
[05:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start with QUnit.
[05:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> We want to investigate something with Web Driver support though.
[05:55:44] <kborchers> yeah, i just wasn't sure where to even start there since i've never written selenium tests
[05:56:41] <kborchers> i mean, i guess i can just create "visual tests" and worry about the web driver stuff later, right?
[05:56:49] <kborchers> in addition to qunit of course
[05:58:08] <kborchers> well, i'll start writing QUnit tests tonight and we can go from there

[08:11:37] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: Resigned CLA
[10:26:35] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle. New Jenkins is somewhat working.
[10:27:09] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I've read the message. However the problems you're experiencing were already foreseen and indicated in the tasks I laid out.
[10:27:25] <jzaefferer> yeah, noting surprising, sure. Still could use your help resolving those
[10:27:49] <Krinkle> If I'd do it, I'd clear out the new jenkins again and follow the tasks in sequence :)
[10:35:36] <jzaefferer> why?
[10:35:42] <jzaefferer> What's the point of clearing things?
[10:35:47] <jzaefferer> The jobs themselve don't change much
[10:36:23] <jzaefferer> And while I tried importing everything, the workspaces are so big that its better to import just the config files, without workspace or previous builds
[10:36:45] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: unrelated, but also interesting: What's wrong with redirecting to "third-party" sites from docs.jquery.com?
[10:36:58] <Krinkle> Nothing, I already told Scott
[10:37:23] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: That means links will be broken
[10:37:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: And though configs might not change often why risk undoing changes? It doesn't take much effort to re-import whenever the issues are fixed
[11:39:47] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: "That means links will be broken" - I don't understand. Could you just reply to the devs-team thread?
[11:40:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: That wasn't about wiki, thus there's no thread.
[11:40:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I was referring to jenkins
[11:41:20] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:42:19] <jzaefferer> well, I don't think links to old builds are worthwhile. They usually get deleted after a while anyway.
[11:48:19] <jzaefferer> But I also don't oppose to doing it right, as long as we get it done. 
[12:20:50] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: The workspaces are the biggest but those will be re-created as soon as each job runs, they only reflect the state of the last build.
[12:20:59] <Krinkle> the build history shouldn't be that big in size
[12:21:37] <Krinkle> the workspaces aren't important as those are wiped each run anyway, it just seems easier to include it instead of excluding it in the sync to the new server.
[12:24:38] <jzaefferer> job config without builds/workspace: a few kb; the full jobs dir, zipped: ~3.5gb
[12:25:25] <Krinkle> It's easiest imho to just rsync or scp /var/lib/jenkins as a whole. It's all internal data, a few gigs should be trivial
[13:37:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you still around?
[13:44:15] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: never mind will try to catch you tomorrow. Just wanted to ask how big was  the task of porting the content to the blog
[13:44:46] <agcolom> Is it a copy/paste exercise?
[13:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Not exactly copy/paste, but fairly close.
[13:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Since MediaWiki syntax isn't HTML.
[13:53:51] <agcolom> hi
[13:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://docs.jquery.com/mw/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&prefix=Release&namespace=0&hideredirects=1
[13:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can you see that page?
[13:54:35] <agcolom> yes
[13:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, good. That's the list of all the pages that need to be ported to blog posts.
[13:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> There are probably already blog posts, but I'm guessing they don't have this content in them.
[13:55:36] <agcolom> ok, doesn't look too bad. 
[13:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> It'd probably be a good idea to ping DaveMethvin about this too.
[13:55:47] <agcolom> I'm not familiar with mediawiki content.... 
[13:56:38] <agcolom> I might need guidance to do the 1st one and then it should just be a repetitive task, right?
[13:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> So here's the blog post for 1.2: http://blog.jquery.com/2007/09/10/jquery-12-jqueryextendawesome/
[13:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> Which would pull content from http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2
[13:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which links off to a bunch of other pages, like http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2/Attributes
[13:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how detailed DaveMethvin wants to get with this stuff.
[14:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe don't start with 1.2 :-P
[14:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> The others look a lot smaller.
[14:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> Like http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.2.6
[14:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, it looks like for that release, the docs are just duplicated: http://blog.jquery.com/2008/06/04/jquery-126-events-100-faster/
[14:02:25] <agcolom> I should have some time on saturday... 
[14:02:41] <agcolom> maybe friday evening... not sure yet... 
[14:04:42] <agcolom> that post already seems to have to content in?
[14:05:51] <agcolom> the content ^
[14:07:10] <agcolom> so is the task to copy content from the media wiki into blog posts (and create the blog posts if these don't already exist and backdate to the original date).
[14:07:21] <agcolom> Is that directly into Wordpress?
[14:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: yup
[14:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like some (possibly even most) already have the content.
[14:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> So that'll make it easy.
[14:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> But the 1.2 release has a lot of content on MediaWiki.
[14:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> But, again, I don't know how DaveMethvin will want to handle that one.
[14:09:35] <agcolom> ok, it's gone 10pm here... should we catch up again tomorrow? 
[14:11:09] <agcolom> If you have time friday evening my time (I guess friday afternoon your time, from say 3pm your time or later?) then we can go through was is needed and how to do it? Would that be ok? I could spend a good bit of time saturday on it... 
[14:11:15] <agcolom> How does that sound?
[14:16:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^
[14:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[14:19:41] <agcolom> ok great! speak tomorrow or friday then... 
[14:19:49] <agcolom> Thanks
