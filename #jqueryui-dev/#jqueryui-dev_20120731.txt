[05:43:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ping
[05:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> hey kborchers
[05:44:16] <kborchers> stupid bot-t
[05:44:31] <kborchers> [22:57:32] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez rworth jzaefferer please let me know what you think of what i have done so far when you have a chance. i am not designer so there could be a better way :) https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/style-updates
[05:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check that out in a bit.
[05:45:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: no rush, just finally got a chance to throw it in a branch
[05:45:36] <kborchers> i also made those menu changes so let me know what you think about those too
[05:45:42] <kborchers> when you get a chance
[05:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> I left a comment on the wiki about those changes (for the person who filed that ticket).
[05:49:26] <kborchers> cool
[06:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[06:18:25] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: morninbg
[06:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> Hey nacin.
[06:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> I just ran into an issue using setup_postdata().
[06:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> It either doesn't do what I think or it's broken :-P
[06:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/a5469c944fc290081cc13813ce38a66e480474dd#L0R44
[06:19:12] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[06:19:25] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you're looking for the_post()
[06:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> I had foreach( $new_plugins as $new_plugin) : setup_postdata( $new_plugin );
[06:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> the_post( $new_plugin ) ?
[06:19:46] <nacin> where is $new_plugins coming from?
[06:19:52] <nacin> get_posts()?
[06:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[06:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> Just a few lines aboave.
[06:20:21] <nacin> change that get_posts() to new WP_Query
[06:20:54] <nacin> then do while ( $new_plugins->have_posts() ) { $new_plugins->the_post(); the_title(); } wp_reset_postdata();
[06:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: I came up with this by looking at this example: http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts#Posts_list_with_offset
[06:21:50] <nacin> sigh.
[06:22:12] <nacin> so in that case it works because they're doing global $post and deliberately setting the global $post in the foreach.
[06:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> Which I then ended up doing :-/
[06:23:01] <nacin> so, the way I'm suggesting can handle this without referencing globals, at least.
[06:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> It would actually be nice if that just worked.
[06:23:16] <nacin> it would indeed be.
[06:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that would have a lot of potential to break stuff though.
[06:23:48] <nacin> this is a bit nicer, though: http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Interacting_with_WP_Query
[06:24:03] <nacin> yeah, globals in general are fragile.
[06:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll switch to WP_Query.
[06:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> updated
[06:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks nacin.
[07:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Seems good to me.

[07:09:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: thanks
[07:09:54] <kborchers> Effects! WTF?!?
[07:10:08] <kborchers> cc gnarf :P
[07:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's a swarm/BrowserStack issue.
[07:10:31] <kborchers> yeah, just wanted to pick on gnarf :)
[07:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> I would like to know why it's only broken with jquery-git though.
[07:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, I'm sure it is gnarf's fault, with the effects rewrite.
[07:11:23] <kborchers> obviously
[07:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'd also like to know what's up with all the hanging tests: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[07:12:10] <kborchers> i blame dave for always yelling at the bots
[07:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:12:43] <kborchers> wow, yeah, that's a lot of hanging tests :/

[08:44:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: whats my fault? :)
[08:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> The IE9 effects failure in swarm.
[08:45:30] <gnarf> core / UI?
[08:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> UI
[08:45:53] <gnarf> thats the one that it works if we request a rerun right?
[08:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> The one that always fails in swarm with BrowserStack, but passes when you run it directly.
[08:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[08:46:27] <scott_gonzalez> I really want to know what change from the effects rewrite causes that weird bug.
[08:50:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez - if there was a better error message then I might be able to speculate
[08:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, doesn't help that it's impossible for us to reproduce for debugging either.
[08:51:08] <gnarf> ^^^
[08:51:53] <gnarf> doing a build now to check on it again
[08:53:21] <gnarf> "[TestSwarm] window.onerror: Invalid argument." wtf does this mean?
[08:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> No idea.
[08:55:00] <gnarf> seems to happen on blind?
[08:55:10] <gnarf> i dunno tho
[08:55:22] <gnarf> like its not an "error" that was caught by qunit
[08:55:27] <gnarf> at least i don't think so
[08:55:41] <gnarf> doesn't qunit trap exceptions and mark them as a "red" in tests?
[08:59:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so - i wonder if we were to reproduce this crazy iframe test method and have it run menu tests then effects tests if we could reproduce it
[08:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> It only fails running through the BrowserStack API + TestSwarm.
[08:59:54] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer already did a local TestSwarm setup and it passed.
[09:00:43] <gnarf> did he try local testswarm with a browserstack ie9 ?
[09:01:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: actually now thinking about it again, my test might have been flawed. The problem seems to occur only within the context of all the other tests, I probably just ran effects and nothing else
[09:01:18] <jzaefferer> which would just reproduce a standalone rerun
[09:01:29] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, local testswarm with browserstack
[09:01:33] <jzaefferer> but only the single test
[09:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Oh, well that was silly :-P
[09:02:20] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:03:27] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[09:03:28] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #53: FIXED in 11 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/53/
[09:03:41] <gnarf> with rerun request
[09:04:05] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah, it seems to only error if effects isn't the first suite it runs
[09:04:16] <gnarf> like i have to wait for IE9 to get done, the request the rerun
[09:04:25] <gnarf> otherwise it still errors
[09:06:01] <jzaefferer> we can move effects to the top :p
[09:06:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: might make it look like we have a good suite, realistically we need to figure out what black magic causes the bug instead of using our own black magic to fix it ;)
[10:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8416
[10:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just go back to leaving events in 1.8.x?
[10:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really want to deal with uuids for event namespaces in 1.8.x
[10:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> But that other bug has existed forever, so I'm not too concerned about rolling back.
[13:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Any progress on the plugins site docs?
[13:12:02] <ajpiano> argh, sorry no
[13:12:17] <ajpiano> i started a client proj last monday that is pretty intense, thats why i've been kind of out of the loop on everything

[14:18:10] <gnarf> man, swarm is acting strange today
[14:18:17] <gnarf> with the perma "running" status
