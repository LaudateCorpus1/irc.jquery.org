[12:07:44] <Es0teric> anybody here?
[12:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:12:01] <Es0teric> scott_gonzalez ok so i am using jquery ui sortable and i want the index to start at 1 instead of zero
[12:12:18] <Es0teric> so when it goes from start to update or end it does +1 or -1
[12:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Es0teric: Support is in #jquery.
[12:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> This channel is for development *of* jQuery UI.
[12:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> So unless you're trying to report a bug about the index, please ask in #jquery.
[13:23:24] <Andreea_> Hello, I'm a 2nd year student in computer science and I'd like to join your GSoC 2016 program. I've read your official page and I'd like to know what kind of projects are you having for this year so I can make an idea about how I could get involved. I'm a very dedicated girl and although my level in javascript is not that good, I think I'll be able to learn fast what is needed. It would be my first time entering GSoC program, so
[13:23:54] <Andreea_> phase would be very welcome. Thanks!
[13:31:52] <arschmitz> Andreea_: we have not yet submitted our application for 2016 and do not have a project list. Google wont announce what projects have been selected to participate in GSoC until the end of the month
