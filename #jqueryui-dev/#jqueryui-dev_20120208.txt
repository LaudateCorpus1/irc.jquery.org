[13:41:58] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez
[13:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> YYOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[13:43:24] <kborchers> so, i get to your hood around 6 p.m. on 3/4 if you want to grab a drink/food what ever
[13:43:36] <kborchers> if you're free
[13:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. Putting on my calendar.
[13:44:15] <kborchers> cool
[13:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> How long are you in town?
[13:44:30] <kborchers> plane lands around that time so probably not available till a little later
[13:44:38] <kborchers> in town through 3/6
[13:45:00] <kborchers> so following evening could work too if they don't have stuff we have to attend
[14:12:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so, is the missing bottom border on the header in accordion intended or is that also an unwanted change?
[14:13:43] <kborchers> especially since the border doesn't dissappear in FF :/
[14:13:53] <kborchers> i'll have to look at this more later at home
[14:46:03] <jzaefferer> wish me luck, going to visit the brits early tomorrow, trying to tell 'em something about single page apps on Friday...
[16:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: The missing border is a bug.
[16:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's fixed in master (I fixed it after I worked on the animation code)
[17:55:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any recommendations on merging that PR into master. i think i did it but that missing border bug is there so i think i did something wrong
[17:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...let me see
[17:57:36] <kborchers> this is what i get after the merge https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/blob/accordion-animation/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js
[17:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> gah, I have no idea how I managed to get a conflict with this.
[17:58:31] <kborchers> yeah ... i had to manually fix stuff and that's where i get messed up :/
[17:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like you got the merge right.
[18:00:34] <kborchers> oh really? ok
[18:01:07] <kborchers> i'm seeing the border bug though ... what did you do to fix?
[18:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...your stylesheet looks the same as mine
[18:03:30] <kborchers> hmm, now i'm not seeing it :P
[18:03:36] <kborchers> saw it earlier at work but not now
[18:05:19] <kborchers> must have had a cached stylesheet
[18:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> guess so :-P
[18:07:21] <kborchers> FF10 looks ok here. no jumping
[18:07:24] * kborchers is confused
[18:09:34] <kborchers> on browserstack, FF9 on windows shows no animation, just jumps to end but i think that's just a latency thing
[18:10:08] <kborchers> FF9 on Mac on browserstack shows animation but looks choppy ... again, just looks like latency
[18:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely jittery for me on FF10 on Mac
[18:11:49] <kborchers> i guess maybe i see a little jitter on FF10 but doesn't look terrible
[18:11:57] <kborchers> hmmm
[18:12:35] <kborchers> most of the time it looks normal and then every once in a while i see a little jump at the beginning of the animation
[18:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> You're looking at the default demo?
[18:13:15] <kborchers> yep
[18:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the text below the accordion during the animation.
[18:14:01] <kborchers> oooohhh, i see the jitter
[18:14:06] <kborchers> i see it in chrome too!
[18:14:17] <kborchers> actually in all
[18:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> Really? It's perefectly smooth for me in Chrome.
[18:14:48] <kborchers> definitely see a little jump on chrome
[18:15:03] <kborchers> opera too
[18:15:14] <kborchers> and safari
[18:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure you're not looking at view.jqueryui? :-P
[18:15:28] <kborchers> nope local
[18:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, speaking of view... Try http://view.jqueryui.com/accordion-animation/demos/accordion/default.html
[18:16:58] <kborchers> no jitter but the border bug is there
[18:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> So strange.
[18:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see the border bug.
[18:17:36] <kborchers> what the ????
[18:17:41] * scott_gonzalez wants to kill himself
[18:17:44] <kborchers> chrome?
[18:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Chrome and Firefox
[18:18:24] <kborchers> FF no border bug but chrome i see it
[18:22:52] <kborchers> got any math problems scott_gonzalez? i would prefer those right now i think :P
[18:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> The sad thing is that this is a math problem :-P
[18:23:42] <kborchers> yeah, i guess it is
[18:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t1: How do we fix this animation shit?
[18:31:21] <bot-t1> scott_gonzalez, Outlook not so good.
[18:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> Tell me about it!
[18:31:37] <kborchers> lol
