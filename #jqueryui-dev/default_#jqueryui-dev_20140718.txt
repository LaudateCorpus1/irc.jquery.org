[05:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Late start on UI today or just tired of deleting all the spam? :-P
[06:41:04] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: both actually :)
[06:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:41:29] <tj_vantoll> It's getting crazy.
[06:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to have the infrastructure team sift through IPs for POSTs to bugs.jqueryui.com and see if we can find the spammer.
[06:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> We should put up a TOS and make spamming a crime :-P
[06:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> If innocent people can get arrested under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, we can certainly use it for asshole spammers, right?
[06:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> One of us would probably need to kill ourselves from the emotional trauma of dealing with spam before we could take legal action though :-P
[06:48:37] <tj_vantoll> lol
[06:49:03] <tj_vantoll> It sure seems like this is a single spammer behind this most recent crime spree.
[06:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Just to be clear, the disable() example isn't what's live, it was my proposal for solving it.
[07:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> But since you agree that it looks right that way, I'll go ahead and update all the methods to use multiple signatures.
[07:40:27] <tj_vantoll> It isn't what's live? http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#method-disable
[07:40:34] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> Notice the disable( index )
[07:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> There's no disable( href )
[07:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't fit all three on my screen for the screnshot, so I just took the two affected by the change.
[07:41:18] <tj_vantoll> Ah, so different numbers of arguments are split, but not variations in the same argument.
[07:41:33] <tj_vantoll> Regardless I like splitting them up.
[07:41:53] <tj_vantoll> On a related note, I'm trying this http://contribute.jquery.org/repo-maintainers-guide/#fetch-the-pull-request
[07:42:01] <tj_vantoll> $ git pru 217
[07:42:01] <tj_vantoll> f() { git fetch -fu upstream refs/pull/$1/head:pr/$1; git checkout pr/$1 } ; f: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
[07:42:28] <tj_vantoll> I'm wondering what I'm missing.
[07:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...is your remote called upstream?
[07:42:48] <tj_vantoll> yeah
[07:42:59] <tj_vantoll> $ git remote -v
[07:43:00] <tj_vantoll> origin	https://github.com/tjvantoll/api.jqueryui.com.git (fetch)
[07:43:00] <tj_vantoll> origin	https://github.com/tjvantoll/api.jqueryui.com.git (push)

[07:43:00] <tj_vantoll> upstream	https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com.git (push)
[07:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> I use a slightly different alias, so let me try adding this one and see if it works for me.
[07:43:50] <tj_vantoll> The error looks like I missed the end quote, but I verified that I copied the thing right.
[07:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it's missing a semicolon.
[07:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> Before the closing brace.
[07:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> Deploying the fix now.
[07:47:53] <tj_vantoll> Ah I see it now. Yep that worked.

[10:18:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: i was on vacation im not sure
[10:18:29] <arschmitz> i know i read logs but dont know about minutes
[10:19:06] <agcolom> yes, I was wondering whether they got overwritten? (tab renamed?)
[10:19:14] <agcolom> I'll check with jasperdegroot
[10:19:18] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[10:19:49] <arschmitz> i added the tab for yesterday and i made a copy so i dont think so
[10:19:49] * agcolom goes back mouse hunting in my bedroom! 
[10:20:28] <agcolom> ok, that's goof to know, thanks
[10:20:34] <agcolom> good to know ^
[11:27:41] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: that classes demo using bootstrap is awesome.

[12:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, the classes option works pretty well :-)
[12:18:48] <petersendidit> :-)
[12:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 3562 commits." whoa
[12:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> And that's why separate projects get separate repos...
[12:48:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Here's a weird thing I ran into while working on tokentextarea2 for web-ui-fw: http://jsbin.com/rasoliva/1/
[12:49:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For some reason, widths behave differently among inline-block elements when those elements are present in the original markup (think option enhanced) vs. when they are added at runtime.
[12:49:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh: Focus on the textinput to see the difference.
[12:49:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I painted it purple so you can see where the textinput is at.
[12:51:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: This bodes ill for widgets where we generate DOM during enhance, DOM for which we then set position/dimension via JS later on - if we want option enhanced to support having those elements already in the DOM.
[12:52:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: To fix http://jsbin.com/rasoliva/1/ I had two alternatives: do not support having the buttons already in the DOM, or remove() them and then re-insert them - defeating the whole purpose of option enhanced :/
[12:53:42] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm seriously considering building Chrome from sources and tracing into the native code to see where the two code paths diverge.
[12:54:16] <gabriel_schulhof> The thing is, it's also happening on FF. So, I dunno if this is some spec thing, or if both browsers have the same bug.
[13:21:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Here's one with only core (so we know it's not the library's fault): http://jsbin.com/rowajepa/1/
[13:42:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im confused
[13:42:59] <arschmitz> the output is the same for both
[13:43:06] <arschmitz> but one jumps to a new line
[13:44:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Exactly.
[13:44:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Why does the pre-rendered one jump?
[13:44:51] <gabriel_schulhof> The widths involved are exactly the same, only in the second case, the button was part of the original markup.
[13:46:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I've actually opened two tabs, two copies of the developer tools, and I've jumped from line to line, looking for a difference in values, and I could find none.
[13:46:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Then I comparatively looked at the computed styles for each element, and again, I could see no difference.
[13:46:38] <gabriel_schulhof> So the only difference must be internal to the browser.
[13:46:46] <gabriel_schulhof> But both FF and Chrome?
[13:48:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: In ther process of beating my head against this bug, I found an important feature, however: position: absolute without specifying left and top is really useful, because the element continues to flow with the text, but it takes up no room.
[13:48:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[13:48:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and so if its width exceeds the width of the parent, it does not flow to the next line.
[13:48:57] <gabriel_schulhof> ... which is exactly what I want.
[13:49:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean sure, it's gonna look ugly if ever the input gets a background, but then you can always just set overflow: hidden on the wrapper.
[13:49:54] <gabriel_schulhof> But this bug just totally threw me.
[13:50:08] <gabriel_schulhof> If it is a bug even.
[13:52:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://jsbin.com/rowajepa/3/edit
[13:54:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... weird ...
[13:54:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, not so weird.
[13:55:19] <gabriel_schulhof> If you remove the pre-rendered link and then you put it back, it fixes the problem. So, I'm guessing something about the recorded chunk of DOM is wrong.
[13:56:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec.
[13:56:55] <gabriel_schulhof> If clone() uses .innerHtml, then that may be doing the same thing as when it's done a-priori.
[13:57:17] <gabriel_schulhof> But if clone() were to traverse the existing DOM, it should work, because it would end up inserting the button at runtime,.
[13:57:54] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I think it may be a problem with the way the DOM is being set up for that particular snippet of HTML.
