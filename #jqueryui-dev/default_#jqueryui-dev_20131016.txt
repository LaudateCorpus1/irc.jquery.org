[00:10:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I don't get it. Should I remove the deprecation notice from the API docs?
[00:10:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, it /is/ deprecated, right?
[00:10:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah sorry, no need to remove that
[00:11:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes it is deprecated
[00:11:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll add that note about specifying the transition manually.
[00:11:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks!
[00:17:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/proxy/browse.php?u=http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/global-config/#defaultDialogTransition
[00:17:23] <_|Nix|_> Curious if that link works ...
[00:19:09] <_|Nix|_> I'll add more to that note - specifically, that you must also specify the transition when calling .pagecontainer( "change", "dialog.html", { transition: "pop" } );
[00:19:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it works
[00:19:16] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!

[00:28:26] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/061-4 143ecd9dd 15Gabriel Schulhof: Global config: Expanded on how to give dialog-styled pages a different transition now that $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition is deprecated.
[00:33:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Since we've removed nested listviews, can we also remove subPageUrlKey without first deprecating it? It's only used by nested listview.
[00:34:04] <_|Nix|_> I mean $.mobile.subPageUrlKey ...
[00:35:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did we ever document it?
[00:35:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could it be 3rd party plugins are using it?
[00:38:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, unless they're using it for something other than nested listview, I guess they could be using it.
[00:38:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess there's no harm leaving it in there for another version. We've had options that were deprecated in 1.1, and only just got removed now.
[00:39:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I really think we should leave the code as it is now unless we run into big bugs
[00:40:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just open a ticket for these things and we can do another cleanup in 1.5
[00:40:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. True.
[00:48:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What is the purpose of the "Notice" label?
[00:48:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... on issues?

[00:55:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's for the auto generated changelog
[00:55:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for "depracated" tickets
[00:55:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we use it for the prefix
[00:56:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: issues that are fixed get the "fixed" label and tickets about deprecating something get "notice"
[00:57:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the changelog it will result in "Fixed: #1234 - blah blah" and "Deprecated: #1234 - blah blah"
[00:58:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oops, I mean... "Notice: #1234 - deprecated blah blah"
[01:26:00] <_|Nix|_> Oh, no! Issues that are fixed get the "Fixed" label? Doesn't GH close those issues automagically when you mention them from a commit?
[01:27:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: It has not really to do with GH
[01:28:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's only for our changelog script

[06:55:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have time to look at demos-nav now?
[06:55:45] <arschmitz> yup
[06:55:49] <uGoMobi> great
[06:56:50] <arschmitz> first think i noticed was right now all the links are designed to work from main menu
[06:57:01] <arschmitz> and not individual pages i thought you wanted the other way around?
[06:57:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[06:57:23] <uGoMobi> have to add ../
[06:57:29] <arschmitz> right
[06:57:43] <uGoMobi> but didn't do that because I wasn't sure if you were already doing that
[06:57:48] <arschmitz> i can do that i just wanted to check first because i thought you were already doing it
[06:57:50] <arschmitz> lol
[06:57:53] <arschmitz> ok no problem
[06:57:54] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:58:12] <arschmitz> ok next thing is the search list is not working
[06:58:19] <arschmitz> because you are wrapping a ul in a ul
[06:58:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[06:58:29] <arschmitz> combined with a filter
[06:58:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and collapsibles
[06:58:44] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:59:11] <arschmitz> i was thinking that we should take the ul out of jqm-contents
[06:59:20] <arschmitz> and have it just be the li's
[06:59:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, except that the collapsible is also a LI
[06:59:59] <uGoMobi> we need to filter that one out too
[07:00:25] <uGoMobi> s/that one/those/
[07:00:34] <arschmitz> yes thats no problem
[07:00:39] <arschmitz> filter has a children selector
[07:00:46] <arschmitz> option
[07:01:08] <arschmitz> that should take care of this
[07:01:23] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:01:45] <uGoMobi> but not all LI's are in a nested UL
[07:02:09] <arschmitz> yes it can be a complex selector
[07:02:23] <arschmitz> or multiple comma seperater selectors
[07:02:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can also add a class to the LI's
[07:02:41] <arschmitz> basicly anything you can pass to jquery 
[07:02:49] <uGoMobi> if that makes things easier
[07:03:06] <arschmitz> ehh for this i can just use data-role="collapsible"

[07:03:22] <arschmitz> not super concerned about selector speed and we know namesapce is not an issue 
[07:03:34] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:04:08] <arschmitz> so i really like the new layout with the side navigation
[07:04:25] <arschmitz> and it actually addresses some complaints i got from people about new demos last week
[07:04:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[07:04:50] <arschmitz> a few people really disliked the nav panel on desktop
[07:04:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: want to do something with the homepage
[07:05:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats the next thing i was going to say
[07:05:07] <arschmitz> is we need to jazz up the homepage 
[07:05:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, just wanted to get the global stuff done first
[07:05:34] <arschmitz> yeah of course
[07:05:57] <arschmitz> but i really like the new layout
[07:06:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can make changes in demos folder after RC, right?
[07:06:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[07:06:24] <arschmitz> yes
[07:06:59] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[07:07:25] <arschmitz> your welcome addresses what i had said before about making it look more like a responsive desktop site and not so phone specific
[07:08:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we had data-section on the LI's in the navmenu
[07:08:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure if it was for global navmenu or search
[07:08:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I agree our demos should demonstrate that JQM is not mobile only
[07:09:15] <arschmitz> dont think it was for global nav i actually dont recall what that was for ill have to look
[07:09:22] <uGoMobi> if I have time I will add another breakpoint
[07:09:30] <uGoMobi> to optimize a bit for tablets
[07:09:33] <arschmitz> cool
[07:09:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't recall either, but the data-sections are gone
[07:10:02] <arschmitz> ok
[07:10:07] <uGoMobi> because the sections are gone
[07:10:12] <arschmitz> right
[07:10:22] <arschmitz> i think it was for search
[07:10:27] <arschmitz> so it did not show up in there
[07:10:40] <uGoMobi> or maybe to sort
[07:10:49] <uGoMobi> all LI's had the attribute
[07:11:02] <arschmitz> so ill fix up the linking and work on the search
[07:11:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[07:11:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when search is working again I will fix the style for it
[07:11:42] <arschmitz> awesome
[07:11:56] <arschmitz> im going to do some other cleanup in the demos.js too
[07:11:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I haven't looked at the search results page yet either
[07:12:07] <arschmitz> i noticed a bunch of stuff in there that needs cleanup
[07:12:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill make sure i include that when i look at search
[07:12:42] <arschmitz> i know i made it but i dont even recall how it works right now lol
[07:12:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, and we have to be careful with those listview widget overrides that it doesn't affects demos
[07:13:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, it has been a while
[07:13:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i want to get rid of any thing we can do without
[07:14:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - the reason search submits to ../_search/ instead of search-results.php is because the build script changes the .php in the markup to .html
[07:14:32] <uGoMobi> so search didn't work in a build
[07:15:16] <arschmitz> ok
[07:19:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Should I document $.mobile.path?
[07:20:35] <arschmitz> thats been documented since 1.0 i think
[07:21:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.0/docs/api/methods.html
[07:21:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We're deprecating $.mobile.getDocumentUrl and $.mobile.getDocumentBase and saying they've moved to path. So we should document path ... 
[07:22:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: path methods are documented individually: http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.path.get/
[07:22:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Instead, we should have one entry.
[07:22:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[07:22:42] <arschmitz> it should be one entry
[07:22:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... I'll pull it together.
[07:22:54] <arschmitz> awesome
[07:23:14] <arschmitz> did we ever document navigator or history object i dont think we did right?
[07:23:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, and we're not going to, either, I don't think.
[07:23:55] <_|Nix|_> Not exactly sure what entry type to set for path ...
[07:23:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was just going to say if we havent i dont want them documented for now
[07:24:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm what are the options again?

[07:44:04] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: ^^^ just "fixed" the test task; now it at least tries to run something, but warns about running 0 assertions
[07:44:43] <jzaefferer> its odd that you don't call QUnit.start() after loading tests
[07:45:11] <rxaviers> have you seen my FIXME comment? I wanted to call, but calling it was failing the test
[07:45:31] <rxaviers> You told me I should use QUnit.config.autostart, so I guessed this was expected
[07:46:07] <jzaefferer> well, you've set it to `true`, which is the default value; you need autostart=false
[07:46:12] <jzaefferer> let me commit that
[07:46:18] <rxaviers> wait
[07:46:21] <jzaefferer> that also makes the grunt task run stuff
[07:46:33] <rxaviers> well, ok

[11:19:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: Where exactly do we mention that $.mobile.widget is deprecated? I don't think it's in the API docs, so changelog and blog post at most, I think. Right?
[11:21:00] <arschmitz> yeah i think so its never been documented 
[11:21:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[11:21:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's not in the changelog
[11:22:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: its never even been documented as existing so we dont NEED to say anything but we should mention it
[11:34:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I for one started with $.mobile.widget for all of web-ui-fw's widgets, so there may be other widgets out there deriving from $.mobile.widget.
[11:35:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, we definitely need to deprecate.
[11:35:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm even considering that we should add a notice somewhere in the API docs about the deprecation - but where?
[11:36:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well its technically not deprecated there is no deprecation period its already completely gone
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> but i agree it should be documented that it has been removed for anyone using it
[11:38:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. It's not gone. You went to the length of saying $.mobile.widget = $.Widget; - a very good thing.
[11:38:27] <arschmitz> oh yeah forgot i did that
[11:38:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and it should stay that way in 1.4.0, with a big fat deprecation notice.
[11:38:32] <arschmitz> yes
[11:38:41] <arschmitz> because it was documented as existing in old docs
[11:38:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but where should I put the notice?
[11:38:44] <arschmitz> thats right
[11:39:14] <arschmitz> in old docs there was a note somewhere "all jquery mobile widgets inherit from the mobile base widget"
[11:39:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i guess i would add a widget named mobile
[11:39:55] <arschmitz> and mark it as deprecated
[11:40:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weeeeell, I dunno ... that doesn't seem prominent enough to me, since the entry's never been there ...
[11:41:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec - doesn't widgets have its own section with a <desc>? I think that may be the way to go.
[11:41:27] <arschmitz> oh yeah 
[11:41:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bam!
[11:41:39] <arschmitz> yeah that sounds fine

[12:03:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thank you ill take a look
[12:03:49] <_|Nix|_> core-2.0? Are we moving up for 1.4.0?
[12:04:00] <_|Nix|_> It's cool by me - just curious.
[12:04:12] <_|Nix|_> I guess we've been testing with it for a long time now.
[12:04:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, 1.4 will support core 2.0
[12:05:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that branch is just because our demos on master are using core 1.10
[12:06:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Travis tests against core 2.0 but still good to actually give it a look, that's why the branch
[12:06:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[12:12:03] <_|Nix|_> On an unrelated note: Does core support :any() yet? I guess I'm asking because I'd like to re-write the textinput initSelector after the fact to exclude some stuff. What I mean is this: $.mobile.textinput.prototype.initSelector = ":any(" + $.mobile.textinput.prototype.initSelector + "):not(:jqmData(role='hsvpicker'))";
[12:13:02] <_|Nix|_> Now, if :any() is not supported, the only way to do it is to use ":not(:not(" + originalValue + ")):not(:jqmData(role='hsvpicker'))" ...
[12:13:19] <_|Nix|_> ... and that's a waste ...
[12:14:00] <_|Nix|_> Either that or I start parsing the initSelector for textinput :/
[12:35:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so demos search is functional again

[12:37:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh actually that is working already
[12:37:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its just the css rules are no longer applying need to check that
[12:38:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, probably because button markup changed
[12:39:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually looks like the rules have been completely removed
[12:44:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i got the old css from 1.3-stable and added it back
