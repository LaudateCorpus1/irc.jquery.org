[09:04:44] <petersendidit> should returning false to the slide event for the slider drop the handle? or just prevent the value from being set?

[09:18:17] <petersendidit> Can someone comfirm my thoughts here: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4385#comment:8
[09:27:23] <mikesherov> petersendidit: seems like that makes sense
[09:27:59] <petersendidit> Seems like its not a bug with jQuery UI but with the logic he was using in the slide event
[09:30:59] <mikesherov> Yeah, I agree
[09:31:25] <mikesherov> petersendidit: ^
[09:31:39] <petersendidit> Ok will close the ticket

[13:03:10] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov: When I run grunt I'm not getting any warnings so I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong.
[13:04:45] <tj_vantoll> I see <WARN> Task "lint:tests" failed. Used --force, continuing. </WARN> a lot but running grunt â€”force doesn't seem to change anything.  Sorry I'm a grunt novice.
[13:05:43] <mikesherov> No worries. The fact that it failed means you need to correct some stuff tj_vantoll 
[13:06:15] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, have you run the unit tests to see if they are displaying any errors?
[13:06:20] <mikesherov> Also, I assume you have latest master and have done npm install recently?
[13:06:43] <mikesherov> djQuery: He's got some style issues that the units won't catch. 
[13:06:52] <tj_vantoll> On master and npm version 1.2.2.
[13:06:54] <mikesherov> The tests don't lint themselves :)
[13:06:57] <djQuery> ahhh
[13:07:16] <mikesherov> tj_vantoll: Run "npm install"
[13:07:27] <mikesherov> Does that output anything?
[13:07:35] <tj_vantoll> Yeah lots
[13:07:47] <mikesherov> You're welcome :p
[13:08:00] <mikesherov> Now run grunt again
[13:08:11] <tj_vantoll> Much better :)
[13:08:23] <mikesherov> G2g. Later!
[13:08:31] <tj_vantoll> Wish it would've just failed instead of silently looking like it was doing the right thing :)  Thanks a lot!
[23:48:32] <djQuery> mikesherov, let me know whats wrong for next time
[23:48:47] <djQuery> or can I fix it for this time?
