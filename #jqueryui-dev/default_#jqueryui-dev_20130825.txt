[10:22:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ping!
[10:22:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[10:22:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: how goes your weekend?
[10:23:15] <uGoMobi> was relaxed, thanks
[10:23:20] <arschmitz> been doing some bug fixing and looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5953 
[10:23:20] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #5953 by uGoMobi (3mon 3w ago): Support old Firefox as C-grade
[10:23:21] <uGoMobi> yours??
[10:23:32] <arschmitz> good been shopping for new mattress
[10:23:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: found the problem with that issue and its kinda interesting 
[10:24:02] <uGoMobi> ah nice
[10:24:35] <arschmitz> so for transitions we check support for csstransitions and css3dtrnasform 
[10:25:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: however we use css animations and the event we use is css animationend and transitionend
[10:25:23] <arschmitz> *not trnasitionend
[10:25:53] <arschmitz> this breaks firefox 4 because it does not support css animations
[10:26:02] <arschmitz> but it does support css transitions
[10:26:36] <arschmitz> firfox < 4 is fine because it supports neither
[10:26:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see
[10:26:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and firefox > 4 is fine because it supports both
[10:27:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but the thing is we want to support FF 10+
[10:27:04] <arschmitz> but fire = 4 is totally busted 
[10:27:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right but it gets full a grade
[10:27:23] <arschmitz> because it passes tests
[10:27:51] <arschmitz> and then you jsut get a blank page after transition
[10:27:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jeffkevin opened issue #6391: feature request: Max value between dual sliders  02http://git.io/ZIoF4w
[10:27:58] <uGoMobi> yup, so we might need another criteria to define A grade
[10:28:30] <arschmitz> well not a grade but transitions
[10:28:44] <arschmitz> we need to check both animation and transitions to support transitions
[10:30:17] <arschmitz> in theory there could be other browsers that support one and not the other
[10:30:29] <uGoMobi> yeah I see what you mean
[10:31:02] <uGoMobi> you are right that the support test we use should check what we actually use it for
[10:31:21] <arschmitz> need to check modernizer see if they have a css animaation support test
[10:32:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: see this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5916/files#L0R86
[10:32:32] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #5916 by eug48 (4mon 3d ago): Fix breakage on Firefox <4
[10:32:45] <uGoMobi> how come that became a problem in 1.3
[10:32:51] <uGoMobi> and not before
[10:33:02] <uGoMobi> did we change the support test?
[10:33:20] <arschmitz> yes
[10:33:25] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[10:33:41] <arschmitz> not sure if you remember but we change both the support tests several times 
[10:33:48] <arschmitz> Wilto!
[10:33:56] <arschmitz> always good to blame him :)
[10:34:49] <arschmitz> now to be honest though they currently check exactly what they are designed to check and work correctly
[10:34:53] <uGoMobi> ah I remember
[10:35:00] <uGoMobi> it was for IE10 I think
[10:35:09] <arschmitz> csstransition tests SHOULD pass on firefox4
[10:35:43] <uGoMobi> actually FF < 22 is C grade now
[10:36:03] <uGoMobi> I made support for pseudo elements a requirement for A-grade
[10:36:33] <uGoMobi> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gencontent
[10:36:50] <uGoMobi> I thought that was supported on older FF versions already
[10:36:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well all the way back through 4 passes agrade tests
[10:37:18] <uGoMobi> maybe that sourse is incorrect
[10:37:47] <uGoMobi> it is
[10:37:47] <arschmitz> hrm maybe let me check icons
[10:37:48] <uGoMobi> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements
[10:37:50] <arschmitz> that will show
[10:38:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: difference between pseudo elements and content thoguh right?
[10:39:03] <arschmitz> oh nope content is supported all the way back too
[10:39:03] <uGoMobi> oh I looked at the wrong thing :(
[10:39:13] <arschmitz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content
[10:40:05] <uGoMobi> yeah, I think that caniuse is wrong here
[10:40:12] <arschmitz> for sure
[10:40:22] <arschmitz> there is no way that could be 21+
[10:40:38] <uGoMobi> yeah I was surprised by that too
[10:50:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so im thinking ill just add animation test and cehck both props 
[10:51:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, but what will happen on FF < 4 ?
[10:51:59] <arschmitz> c grade
[10:52:03] <arschmitz> just like it is now
[10:52:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what makes it C-grade?

[10:59:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and no errors
[11:00:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[11:01:22] <uGoMobi> I wonder what fixed that issue
[11:40:00] <arschmitz> not sure
[12:38:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[12:38:42] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[12:39:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! So, the get-together in Amsterdam has been finalized to the 4th and the 5th?
[12:40:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, looks like it
[12:40:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what that thread seems to indicate.
[12:40:14] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:40:29] <_|Nix|_> Just wanna make sure I don't show up after everyone's left :)
[12:40:37] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:40:44] <_|Nix|_> Well, at least /you'll/ still be there :)
[12:40:46] <uGoMobi> "settled" sounds final to me

[13:35:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah?
[13:35:49] <uGoMobi> I can still reproduce that with alpha 2
[13:36:00] <uGoMobi> both build and server
[13:36:09] <uGoMobi> IE10 completely crashes
[13:36:22] <arschmitz> real thing or browser stack
[13:36:23] <_zoggy_> anyone got any tips on trying to debug some css for autocomplete (thats ajax driven).. anytime i do inspect element the popup goes away..
[13:36:24] <arschmitz> ?
[13:36:28] <uGoMobi> tested on Win7 / IE10
[13:36:39] <_zoggy_> what about IE11?
[13:36:46] <_zoggy_> or wp8 ie10
[13:38:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are you on actual version or browserstack?
[13:38:52] <arschmitz> _zoggy_: what about them?
[13:39:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actual version
[13:39:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what exactly do you do to reproduce?
[13:40:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: like it is described: select an option and click outside the popup
[13:40:14] <arschmitz> something must be different with browserstack
[13:40:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and IE10 crashes
[13:40:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can select unselect open close all day without issue on there
[13:40:59] <arschmitz> ill reopen and check on real thing tomorrow morning

[13:41:01] <_zoggy_> 	
[13:41:01] <_zoggy_> Firebug 1.10 added a keyboard shortcut for "Break on.." (alt-ctrl-b). This is extremely handy in situations just like this (because normally you would have to move your mouse to Firebug, which will hide your popup).
[13:49:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just tested again. It does not completely crash but more like the browser is minimized.
[13:49:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: kinda weird bug
[13:50:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you click on the IE icon in the taskbar nothing happens, but if you show the desktop and then click on the icon you see the browser again
[13:50:51] <uGoMobi> :/

[13:56:20] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you there?
[13:57:04] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[13:57:08] <gseguin> hey
[13:57:17] <gseguin> so almost done with the css change
[13:57:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: awesome!
[13:57:44] <gseguin> question I had is: do we want unminified css in the zip for our website?
[13:58:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: not sure what CSS you mean
[13:58:54] <gseguin> all these files that I'm generating
[13:59:08] <gseguin> also do we want the unminified in the cdn ?
[14:00:12] <uGoMobi> yeah, I think we have to be consistent and have minified and unminified of all files
[14:00:21] <gseguin> I just checked the zip for alpha 2 and it contains .css and .min.css
[14:00:26] <gseguin> so I'll do the same
[14:00:31] <uGoMobi> great
[14:00:40] <gseguin> ok same for the CDN then
[14:00:52] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:14:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats crazy im surprised it does not happen on browserstack since thats just a vm 
[14:15:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[14:15:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: really curious what triggers it
[14:16:04] <uGoMobi> could not reproduce it with popups or anything
[14:16:12] <arschmitz> yeah only think i can reproduce at all is it seems like all custom selects need a double click outside them to close
[14:16:35] <arschmitz> and it has to be an actual double click a click followed by a click wont do it
[14:16:49] <arschmitz> but the close button and back button work fine
[14:17:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so at the moment im kinda stumped lol but i have actual windows 7 with ie10 at work so ill check it out in the morning
[14:19:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: even a right mouse button click triggers the issue
[14:19:30] <arschmitz> weird!
[14:22:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and you said you checked http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/forms/ right?
[14:22:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just checked that and cannot reproduce :/
[14:22:57] <arschmitz> oh ok so explains why i could not also
[14:23:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but with alpha 2 I did
[14:24:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: correction
[14:24:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can reproduce on http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/forms/ 
[14:24:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I forgot to select another option first
[14:24:44] <arschmitz> ok
[14:25:08] <arschmitz> ok so all you do is open select another option eg: rush 
[14:25:14] <arschmitz> and then close?
[14:25:25] <arschmitz> so you have 2 selected at that point
[14:25:40] <uGoMobi> not closing it with the close button
[14:25:51] <uGoMobi> but clicking outside the popup
[14:26:03] <arschmitz> right
[14:26:10] <uGoMobi> also tested http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/selects/custom-selects.php
[14:26:22] <uGoMobi> the optgroup and multiple examples
[14:26:26] <uGoMobi> but no issues
[14:26:36] <arschmitz> weirder
[14:26:46] <uGoMobi> it's only with that example where we combine multiple and optgroup
[14:26:51] <uGoMobi> very weird
[14:27:15] <uGoMobi> I saw the comment on the issue that he could also reproduce with other custom selects but I can't
[14:27:53] <uGoMobi> actually that was the reason I made it an high priority issue
[14:28:16] <uGoMobi> but it seems more like an edge case now and I wonder if there is anything we can do about it
[14:28:47] <arschmitz> yeahsuper weird it does not happen on browserstack too
[14:28:49] <uGoMobi> also because what happens (browser minimizes) is kinda weird
[14:29:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am gonna test on nokia 520 now
[14:29:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and the double click to close on browser stack is odd too we never ever bind to double click
[14:29:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but that might be the browserstack interface
[14:33:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on WP8 / IE nothing happens when clicking outside the selectmenu popup, no crash but it doesn't close either
[14:33:57] <arschmitz> try double tap
[14:34:40] <uGoMobi> I did, same result
[14:34:45] <arschmitz> ok
[14:35:10] <arschmitz> at least its ie10 so i should be able to debug
[14:36:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it looks like there are problems with the markup
[14:37:03] <arschmitz> ohhhh that could cause all sorts of craz
[14:37:48] <uGoMobi> not sure if it's hardcoded or generated markup, checking now
[14:38:31] <uGoMobi> couldn't debug before because I didn't know how to access the browser again
[14:38:40] <arschmitz> right
[14:45:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there were various issues in our markup, it seems like those caused it
[14:45:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the menu still don't close when you click outside
[14:46:10] <uGoMobi> even not when double click
[14:46:27] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so just to make sure we end up with 10 CSS files that we put on the CDN, correct ?
[14:46:54] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think 12
[14:47:11] <gseguin> we don't put the theme file on the CDN
[14:47:19] <gseguin> as per previous discussion
[14:47:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ah ok, then 10 is correct
[14:47:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, doesn't make sense to add theme on CDN
[14:48:52] <gseguin> $ grunt dist:release
[14:49:13] <gseguin> $ find dist -name "*.css"
[14:49:35] <gseguin> dist/jquery.mobile-1.4.0pre.css

[14:50:07] <gseguin> yay!
[14:50:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: nice! thanks!
[14:51:11] <gseguin> ah shite, still a problem with the freaking cdn zip
[14:51:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will cleanup the markup, because I am making lot of changes in the demos anyway
[14:56:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: double click outside the popup does close it, so it's the same as what you saw on browserstack
