[04:39:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[05:30:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:30:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we really should not land other team members prs with out checking with them
[05:31:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that one from scott depended on other prs in other repos that are still being tested and have not landed yet
[05:31:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see. Sorry!
[05:31:34] <arschmitz> he and jorn have been trying to cordinate all the teams for last few days to land all at the same time
[05:32:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm really sorry! I saw the :+1: ... 
[05:32:21] <arschmitz> technically right now mobile is broken if we tried to do a release or test release
[05:32:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should be fine but we should not land other teammembers prs for them let them do that
[05:33:03] <arschmitz> unless they ask or you check with them first
[05:33:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, understood - again, sorry about that!
[05:33:27] <_|Nix|_> I was a bit over-eager :/
[05:33:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should be fine and the other should land today
[06:56:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still there?
[07:10:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah whats up?
[07:20:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[07:20:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, in getLocation() we need to add a "/" to the path if there's a protocol.
[07:20:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or under some circumstances.
[07:20:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Otherwise the whole makePathAbsolute() blows up.
[07:21:02] <arschmitz> ok
[07:21:20] <arschmitz> so how does this effect the fix for windows phone?
[07:21:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On WP, An absolute URL looks like this: x-wmapp0:www/index.html
[07:22:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The fix that has just landed will correctly handle x-wmapp0:/www/index.html.
[07:22:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The Cordova fix, I mean.
[07:22:33] <arschmitz> ok so that landed?
[07:22:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, this basically means that $.mobile.path.getLocation( "http://abc:def@hostname.com" ) => "http://hostname.com/"
[07:22:54] <_|Nix|_> Notice the extra "/" at the end.
[07:23:11] <arschmitz> ok
[07:23:32] <_|Nix|_> If I understood the URL scheme correctly, if a protocol is present, then the path must be absolute.
[07:23:45] <_|Nix|_> ... and if the path is absolute, it must start with a "/".
[07:24:43] <_|Nix|_> ... in fact, that's how we check whether a URL is absolute. We check whether it has a protocol.
[07:24:55] <arschmitz> ok
[07:26:12] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, I'm going to add this to getLocation(): if ( uri.protocol && !uri.pathname.match( /^[/]/ ) { uri.pathname = "/" + uri.pathname; }
[07:26:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think?
[07:27:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just give me a minute to think through this
[07:29:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we actually have or had a warning in the docs that you most always use a trailing /
[07:29:27] <arschmitz> or else it would blow things up
[07:29:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, this will make sure of that.
[07:30:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've checked, and you can't have protocol:<relative path>
[07:30:25] <arschmitz> ok well we should also make sure that warning is still somewhere
[07:30:43] <arschmitz> yeah i didnt think you could
[07:31:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, thanks to M$ you can have protocol:something/somethingElse, which is an absolute path :(
[07:31:43] <_|Nix|_> *facepalm*
[07:31:51] <arschmitz> thats crazy talk
[07:32:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, that's M$ - makers of IE6 :(
[07:32:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html go down to known limitations
[07:33:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Studying 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA might shed some insight into the Big Bang, seeing as how it's the only place in the Universe where the laws of physics are different.
[07:34:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the second warning says you always have to have a trailing slash i dont think that is anywhere we should make sure that is in the api and also add that now we will force one there if its not there
[07:38:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6955.html ... click on "directory"
[07:38:57] <scott_gonzalez> protocol:domain is legit
[07:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's how URLs work.
[07:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> / is just convention
[07:39:37] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, for sure, in fact, the browser appends the "/" in that case.
[07:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, stupid IRC
[07:39:42] <scott_gonzalez>  // is convention
[07:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> It means protocol relative.
[07:40:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Funny ... in every interview given, Sir Tim Berners-Lee always says the // is his only regret and omitting it the only thing he'd do differently. Now it has received a purpose.
[07:42:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The base is OK afterwards. "directory" /is/ added to the base.
[07:42:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I see the problem.
[07:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> There may be some context I'm missing, but prepending a slash after a colon is wrong.
[07:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http:google.com should not be converted to /google.com
[07:43:53] <scott_gonzalez> Though if you're just convering to http:/google.com, that probably works everywhere, though is odd.
[07:44:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm not appending a "/" after the ":"
[07:44:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm prepending a "/" to the pathname if a protocol is present.
[07:44:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The URL is already broken down by a monster regex.
[07:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you manually parsing a URL with a regex?
[07:45:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Because we wanna strip the authority.
[07:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> Let the browser do it for you.
[07:45:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Different browsers do it differently.
[07:46:03] <_|Nix|_> ... believe it or not.
[07:46:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and we need to do things like convert relative path to absolute path.
[07:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> You're saying that URLs are broken on the web?
[07:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> And browsers are interperting the same URL differently?
[07:49:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm sure there's at least one URL out there that behaves that way. I'm talking about how browsers make the location available to us.
[07:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have an example of a URL that two different browsers will parse differently?
[07:51:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6810
[07:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> So Android 4.4 is totally broken?
[07:52:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Looks like.
[07:52:54] <scott_gonzalez> Has it been confirmed on a real device?
[07:54:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im waiting on getting a real device so no only on emulators
[07:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm shocked that this is broken. That's crazy.
[07:55:02] <arschmitz> yeah there are several other severly broken things reported on 4.4
[07:55:03] <_|Nix|_> The issue does mention a WebView, which has been re-written using Blink, IIRC.
[07:55:21] <arschmitz> other are not url related though
[08:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that if URL parsing is broken in one place, it's broken everywhere, but have you tested to see if anchors have the same bug?
[08:04:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i have not yet
[08:05:38] <_|Nix|_> Well, the bottom line is that if we always parse the URL ourselves instead of relying on window.location to be correct, we shouldn't have any problems.
[08:08:00] <_|Nix|_> I will test if my fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574 also fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6810.
[08:08:31] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and I also have to look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6597 while I'm at it, because it may be related.
[08:09:43] <_|Nix|_> Man! It may also fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6597, because the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574 no longer unconditionally appends "//", but instead appends parsedUrl.doubleSlash which is correctly absent when it is indeed absent from the input URL.
[08:09:48] <_|Nix|_> Whew!
[08:10:14] * _|Nix|_ goes to take a break before the big onslaught against the #6597 and #6810.
[08:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, manual URL parsing with a regex won't ever lead to any problems...
[08:11:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: all regexs are perfect
[08:12:01] <arschmitz> always
[08:12:15] <arschmitz> and you have never fixed one i wrote :|
[08:12:30] <arschmitz> ( i also might be dilusional )
[08:28:52] <_|Nix|_> Well, that regex has held up pretty nicely since, like, 1.0.
[08:29:08] <_|Nix|_> Speaking without checking ...
[09:01:47] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: with the roadmap we just discussed, how far along is Globalize now? What's missing that you'll work on next?
[09:03:56] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, is it ok if I ping you as soon as I get back from lunch? I guess in 40min
[09:04:14] <jzaefferer> sure, though I'll likely be gone by then
[09:04:19] <jzaefferer> can talk about it tomorrow
[09:04:51] <rxaviers> absolutely, tomorrow I ping you as soon as I get online
[10:26:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: _|Nix|_ gseguin: I'll be a bit late for the meeting... taking my son to rock climbing.
[10:26:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, np
[10:27:10] <uGoMobi> is he ready for Mount Everest already? ;-)

[12:37:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6810#issuecomment-38203572
[12:37:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think? Is this what the OP was talking about?
[12:41:14] <arschmitz> yeah thats why i had mentioned on the // pr before that i wanted to test it seemed weird for urls to be so broken
[12:41:15] <_|Nix|_> WTF? Isn't /mode +m #jquery-meeting to turn on moderation?
[12:41:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might well have been when 4.4 first came out, but it must've gotten fix real fast.
[12:42:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: would not suprise me i mean broken urls is a big deal
[12:42:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: has a nexus 5
[12:42:35] <arschmitz> set up some simple test pages he can browse too
[12:42:41] <arschmitz> and we can check this for real
[12:43:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the OP mentions that it happens in a WebView, so that might be hard.
[12:43:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe we can dig up that webview app
[12:43:23] <arschmitz> we used to have
[12:43:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you set up Andrdoi SDK and Cordova so you can push something to your android device?
[12:43:29] <uGoMobi> yes, but I don't have the Nexus 5 with me
[12:43:41] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[12:44:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thought that was your actual personal phone?
[12:45:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it will be
[12:45:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What say you we close that bug and leave it to the OP to reopen?
[12:45:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no
[12:45:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[12:45:27] <_|Nix|_> That's fine too.
[12:45:33] <arschmitz> i think we should wait until we can confirm it either way
[12:45:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can test it next week
[12:45:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should really dig up that we view app though
[12:46:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess Android updates are fairly pervasive, right?
[12:46:10] <uGoMobi> have to set up Cordova but shouldn't be too much pain
[12:46:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's easy to set up a new app with cordova.
[12:46:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if we find that app it would be nothing
[12:46:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should spend the time to make a new one otherwise
[12:46:45] <arschmitz> just a webview with a url bar
[12:46:56] <arschmitz> so you can view any page in a android webview
[12:47:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I might still have the app
[12:47:09] <arschmitz> i do on a couple phones
[12:47:15] <arschmitz> just not sure i have the zip still
[12:47:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll look for it now
[12:48:16] <arschmitz> its linked in an old issue too
[12:48:58] <uGoMobi> yeah, that linked to their site
[12:49:05] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:50:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: look for @webslash
[12:50:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats what i was just doing lol
[12:53:00] <arschmitz> i found an issue where i refrence its existance lol
[12:53:29] <arschmitz> found it
[12:53:42] <arschmitz> and it still exists

[12:54:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[12:54:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: if i recall it even allows you to toggle hardware acceleration
[12:54:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't see that
[12:54:43] <arschmitz> oh myabe im wrong
[12:54:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have it installed on my Galaxy Nexus which I have with me here
[12:54:59] <arschmitz> cool yeah i probably just remember wrong
[12:55:11] <uGoMobi> but we want to test on 4.4, right?
[12:55:19] <arschmitz> right
[12:55:25] <arschmitz> this is a 4.4 specific problem

[13:08:22] <cgack> arschmitz: I just hit that test page on an android 4.4.2 webview and I'm not sure what I should expect but the results are the same as my desktop browser
[13:08:52] <arschmitz> cgack: yeah no one so far can reproduce
[13:09:02] <arschmitz> which is odd as we had several releated issues and people confirming
[13:09:08] <arschmitz> so it must have been fixed
[13:09:20] <arschmitz> im pretty sure many of the reports were even pre release
[13:09:48] <arschmitz> cgack: im upgrading one of my phones in a few minutes and going to check also
[13:10:13] <arschmitz> but i think we will close and let them post if they still see it
[13:10:23] <cgack> okay
[13:12:31] <arschmitz> cgack: also i just checked my old firefox os phone
[13:12:42] <arschmitz> and it works perfectly so something is up with this new one
[13:13:09] <arschmitz> i think ill have to send Christian a message on twitter 
[13:13:18] <arschmitz> see if he has any suggestions
[13:15:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool, and the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6574 eliminates the remaining places where we use the browser-provided location.
[13:16:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but why should we not use it if it is indeed the same in all places and not broken on android?
[13:18:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because of the original reason we created getLocation(): https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4787
[13:23:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in a ironic twist all the way at the bottom im the one that commited that ( though not authored )
[13:24:34] <arschmitz> so this is all basicly only about urls with username and password
[13:27:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but it's good practice to always strip the authority if present.
[13:27:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, we only ever access one member of location: location.href.
[13:27:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If that's wrong, well, GIGO.
[13:28:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And, unless some new RFC modifies the URL addressing system, our regex should be pretty stable.
[13:41:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, are we closing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6810?
[13:41:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and related PRs?
[13:42:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im upgrading a phone to double check but yes it looks that way
[13:42:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:43:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please remember to close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6810, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6811, and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7237 at the same time!

[14:01:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so im curious if we can find a simple way to fall back for multiple on desktoip
[14:02:07] <arschmitz> because i have it working for multiple to fall back to native on phones and single
[14:02:11] <arschmitz> and i like it 
[14:02:24] <arschmitz> but multiple on desktop is a whole other issue
[14:02:41] <arschmitz> then we would not need dialog extension even and not depend on pages for select menu
[14:02:48] <arschmitz> i think it should not depend on the page model
[14:05:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's true. It should not depend on the page model.
[14:06:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we can fall back to a listview then - we'd simply paste in the listview which would normally appear in the popup.
[14:06:13] <arschmitz> we need to brain storm a bit on it
[14:06:24] <arschmitz> but we should come up with something
[14:06:41] <arschmitz> since it does not need to open or close maybe just show the native one in a popup ha ha ha 
[14:07:01] <arschmitz> i wish we had a way to detect a virtual keyboard
[14:07:11] <arschmitz> so we could seperatly target desktop and mobile
[14:07:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can't show the native one in a popup, because you'd possible be ripping it out of a form.
[14:07:53] <arschmitz> right
[14:07:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although you could probably set its form property first.
[14:08:04] <arschmitz> well i gotta run to the store
[14:08:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not sure if the native form property is writable.
[14:08:13] <arschmitz> think about it we can try to come up with something sensible
[14:08:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: K. Have fun!
