[06:55:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, do you have a suggestion for the text for "/download/all/ " link? 
[06:55:56] <rxaviers> "All jQuery UI Downloads" ?
[06:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> That seems fine.
[06:56:50] <rxaviers> cool ok

[07:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: yeah

[07:29:04] <tj_vantoll> http://stage.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#removed-offset-option-use-my-or-at The "at" is missing a ` to complete the <code> block.
[07:30:51] <tj_vantoll> http://stage.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#added-support-for-indeterminate-progressbars
[07:30:51] <tj_vantoll> This is minor but "by setting the value" ‚Äî> "by changing the value" sounds better to me.
[07:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Got it thanks.

[07:31:34] <tj_vantoll> From http://stage.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#added-support-for-complex-markup-in-handles on a number of the ticket links are missing end parens.
[07:32:13] <petersendidit> its from that point on that the ending parens are missing

[07:34:45] <petersendidit> Should we give an example of how to use the beforeLoad event to abort the ajax requst for tabs?

[07:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, we should probably have done that in the 1.9 upgrade guide though.
[07:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> Want to send a PR for that in the 1.9 guide?
[07:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> Since we link to that from 1.10, it'll be easily discoverable.
[07:37:04] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez I know it was my choice to read, however I actually thought you would probably have something helpful to say.
[07:37:12] <petersendidit> ok
[07:37:14] <tj_vantoll> Looks good :)
[07:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> missing parens added.

[07:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...maybe I should put out this weeks UI update before I do the release.
[07:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> Would be silly to do the release then have an update saying we're going to release :-P

[08:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, we should probably have a note that we dropped support for IE 6.
[08:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> Probably important to have in the upgrade guide.
[08:28:49] <petersendidit> yea
[08:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> IE 6 usage has dropped to a low enough point that jQuery UI no longer finds it
[08:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> necessary to support. As of 1.10.0, some portions of jQuery UI may not work
[08:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> properly in IE 6. If you need to contnue support IE 6, you should continue using
[08:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> the latest jQuery UI 1.9 release.
[08:32:25] <petersendidit> Sounds good
[08:32:42] <tj_vantoll> +1
[08:32:58] <tj_vantoll> Should we mention that the download builder can be used for multiple versions now?
[08:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Yeah.
[08:33:54] <tj_vantoll> Could even tie it in to the IE6 mention.
[08:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: http://cl.ly/image/1W0h1S1l2x0e
[08:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> supports download -> supports downloading
[08:40:59] <tj_vantoll> "contnue" ‚Äî> "continue"
[08:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[08:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[08:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> missing a word there too.
[08:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> continue to
[08:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'll change it to "keep supporting"
[08:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> So that I don't have continue in that sentence twice.
[08:42:15] <tj_vantoll> Was just typing something to that effect.
[08:42:38] <tj_vantoll> Or just "If you need to continue to support IE6, use the latest jQuery UI 1.9 release."
[08:43:02] <tj_vantoll> "download" ‚Äî> "downloading"
[08:43:55] <tj_vantoll> Looks good.
[08:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok, got both of those in.
[08:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably write something about .ui-front
[08:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> 300 more commits to go through...
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, so many dialog commits.

[10:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is going to happen today.
[10:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: How much longer will you be around?
[10:18:43] <rxaviers> long at least 2h
[10:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:18:55] <rxaviers> I have read the upgrade but found nothing more
[10:19:34] <rxaviers> while in DB, I have not been close enough from 1.9->1.10
[10:20:18] <rxaviers> scott, do you need something?
[10:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> I just wanted to know how much time I had :-)
[10:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted to get the tag done while you were still around so you could do the final testing you wanted to get done.
[10:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll run the release script now so that we have the tag.
[10:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be able to finish the rest of this today.

[10:44:39] <rxaviers> thanks!!
[10:51:00] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, 1.10.0 requires 1.7+ jquery? I tried to find that on api.jqueryui.com/1-10 pages/index.html . But, still with 1.9 info. I dont know if I should find that there...

[11:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> What happened to the download all link?
[11:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> Did it not get committed?
[11:25:02] <rxaviers> it still misses the "Download All link" and the "Quick downloads" links wont work, because it needs the build packages to be in place.
[11:25:24] <rxaviers> WIll be before tomorrow
[11:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> Under Components, the Toggle All gets duplicated every time you change the version.

[11:32:46] <gnarf> need to get with you quick about that actually
[11:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:32:58] <gnarf> i wanna make sure i can stand all that up correctly and run it right
[11:33:08] <gnarf> i don't have a 127.0.0.1 webserver tho
[11:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> what?

[11:41:28] <rxaviers> there we go
[11:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason clicking on 1.10.0 scrolls the page to the top.
[11:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't happen for 1.9.2
[11:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> Is it maybe detecting that there are no params and setting the URL without a hash at all?
[11:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> That must be it.
[11:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, same happens if you just click toggle all twice.
[11:47:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yeah that's a very undesirable thing of using hash's to save state
[11:47:41] <rxaviers> when you select 1.10.0 you revert your choice to the default, therefore you get '#' only
[11:47:52] <rxaviers> then, your browser scrolls to the top
[11:48:04] <scott_gonzalez> Can we use something like #_ instead of an empty hash?
[11:49:28] <rxaviers> I can avoid emptying the variables when it's back to default. So, we could have versions=1.10.0, it would prevent that. But:
[11:49:51] <rxaviers> When user first loads the page, he will get a #versions=1.10.0 instead of nothing
[11:51:39] <rxaviers> Now, we have a model logic there that whenever it's changed, hash is updated. Whenever hash is updated, model is changed.
[11:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> That seems better than what we have now.
[11:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, can we just special case version?
[11:52:18] <rxaviers> Actually, jzaefferer asked to fix eheh
[11:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> He probably didn't realize it would cause this jump.
[11:52:52] <rxaviers> Can we prevent that jump using js?
[11:53:02] <rxaviers> like canceling some event. I've never seen this
[11:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[11:55:16] <rxaviers> maybe we could use something like twitter does #!
[11:55:48] <rxaviers> always having that ! makes it non-empty when empty

[12:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov gnarf: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7612
[12:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> "This was fixed by the core animation rewrite."
[12:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> That was fixed in core, not UI, correct?
[12:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Everything else looks good to go, right?
[12:38:41] <rxaviers> great! good to know

[13:33:46] <jquicommit> 13jqueryui.com/06master 1405ab983 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Added 1.10.0 release zips.
[13:33:58] <rxaviers> and it was a very quick change, no need to create exceptions rules - I love not needing that
[13:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm creating the quick download right now.
[13:34:38] <rxaviers> wait, the name patterns seems different
[13:34:46] <rxaviers> I think we use to have custom in the name
[13:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> custom is for the quick download.
[13:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> The release zips are different.
[13:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> Don't ask why :-P
[13:37:03] <rxaviers> ok hehe
[13:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...the demo page from the download builder has a funky accordion.
[13:37:42] <rxaviers> what do you mean by funky?
[13:38:08] <rxaviers> (Im assuming you're talking about theme roller)
[13:38:55] <scott_gonzalez> I generated the quick download and looking at the index.html.
[13:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> It animated really oddly.
[13:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well.
[13:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna keep moving.
[13:39:10] <rxaviers> ah!
[13:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> The code looks correct.
[13:39:14] <rxaviers> cool
[13:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> What's the flag for skipping the download builder setup?
[13:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> --no-prepare?
[13:40:37] <rxaviers> node server.js --console --nocache
[13:41:01] <rxaviers> --nocache skips caching all zips and images 
[13:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> I meant for jqueyrui.com
[13:41:15] <rxaviers> ah
[13:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's --noprepare.
[13:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> But I couldn't use that anyway.
[13:41:22] <rxaviers> pardom, not aware
[13:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> Because you just bumped the version :-P
[13:42:25] <rxaviers> did I mess something? (ouch)

[14:06:41] <rxaviers> all it needs now is to update packages.js download... to 1.10.0, commit, push, tag and we're good

[14:11:45] <gnarf> should download.jqueryui.com/ redirect to http://jqueryui.com/download/ ?
[14:11:47] <rxaviers> it seems DB is not built yet
[14:11:58] <rxaviers> gnarf, no they are two diff things
[14:12:11] <rxaviers> download.jqueryui.com is the node thing
[14:12:34] <gnarf> right, but there is no style, html, etc on that page -- people should get to jqueryui.com/download instead right?
[14:12:54] <rxaviers> right
[14:13:09] <jzaefferer> hey peopl
[14:13:16] <jzaefferer> I missed a few highlights here, among 500 new messages

[14:14:24] <jzaefferer> are you releasing 1.10 right now?
[14:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's released.
[14:15:29] <jzaefferer> cool
[14:15:35] <gnarf> 1.10.0pre.21 isn't kosher for a tag
[14:15:50] <rxaviers> we should have tag 1.10.0 now
[14:15:54] <gnarf>  /^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-\d+)?$/
[14:16:08] <gnarf> 1.10.0 isn't on https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/tags

[14:55:36] <jzaefferer> that's what I did
[15:50:47] <gnarf> k
[16:27:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yes, it was fixed in core animation rewrite
[16:29:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, posting here is fine, if it's not minor I can create an issue
[16:29:51] <rxaviers> my asap turned out a lot, dinner and etc
[16:29:54] <rxaviers> :S
[16:30:26] <rxaviers> let's begin, looking to the 502 jzaefferer found.
[17:13:36] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15rxaviers opened issue #82: (RFC) 502 Bad Gateway on long urls  02http://git.io/hHBmOg
[17:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back.
[17:46:10] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, about the messy layout, I think it is a OS thing (font thing). It's displaying well in several OSes x browsers https://gist.github.com/4561588 
[17:46:12] <rxaviers> It would be good to know what changes would make it look good to you. Plz just let me know.
[17:46:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, this needs attention http://git.io/hHBmOg
[17:46:44] * rxaviers is tired going to sleep
[17:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, I'd like to figure out how to fix it in nginx.
[17:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Go to sleep :-)
[17:47:19] <rxaviers> :)
[17:47:49] <rxaviers> My ideas are in the issue or gists posted above. It seems the gateway one is the only issue left so far. If there are anything else, plz just let me know.
[17:48:06] <rxaviers> ttyl
[17:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[17:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> Good night.
[18:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> Man, today's release was done in such a rush.
