[05:02:00] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez oh oh .. deleting my comment
[07:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, the timestamps for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9294#comment:3 are wrong.
[07:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't close until after he replied.
[07:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see...
[07:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> He deleted his comment and commented again.
[07:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: We should use POINTER_TYPE_UNAVAILABLE = "on_the_main_level" :-)
[07:47:07] * kborchers adds note to add that :D
[08:55:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure what you mean by your fixHooks comment â€¦ that loop is copying over every prop from the original event to the new event
[09:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but in core that happens automatically because $.event.fixHooks.mousedown exists.
[09:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L496-L503
[09:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> We can just define fixHooks for the pointer events.
[09:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> And then the copying would happen automatically.
[09:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is that correct?
[09:04:06] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez yes, but remember that fixHooks only run for natural events and not manually triggered ones
[09:04:08] <DaveMethvin> so if we're simulating stuff the rules are different
[09:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right.
[09:04:29] <DaveMethvin> but afaict it looks like kborchers already took care of most of that translation
[09:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of triggered events vs. native events...
[09:05:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so i should leave it as is?
[09:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> Kyle Simpson just asked for a new event in HTML and in his polyfill he was using real event triggering.
[09:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: yeah
[09:05:37] <kborchers> ok, i'll just fix that other comment â€¦ any other thoughts
[09:05:38] <kborchers> ?
[09:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/getify/5558974#file-gistfile1-js-L37-L53
[09:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is this just leaving out some browsers?
[09:06:26] <DaveMethvin> definitely if it's using document.createEvent
[09:06:28] <DaveMethvin> oldIE
[09:07:11] <DaveMethvin> but we don't have hooks for autoscroll so fix woudn't do much anyway
[09:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> It falls back to just using an object.
[09:07:34] <DaveMethvin> right but it calls dispatchEvent
[09:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> I just meant for getting native event bubbling, error handling, etc.
[09:07:42] <DaveMethvin> in oldie it would have to call fireEvent

[10:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I'm having a hell of a time figuring out how to get this category to show up.
[10:18:53] <tj_vantoll> :( Yeah I looked into it a little and was overwhelmed.
[10:19:39] <Jack_q> ..
[10:19:39] <jquicommit> 01[13jquery-ui01] 15kborchers pushed 1 new commit to 06interactions-pointer: 02http://git.io/DgRIuw
[10:19:39] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06interactions-pointer 14f3031dd 15Kris Borchers: Pointer: Only loop through mouseProps for mouse events
[10:26:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do you know if it is described anywhere if enter should come before or after over and same for leave/out?
[10:28:13] <kborchers> though i guess it's a little more complicated than that :)
[10:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like it.
[10:29:44] <kborchers> ignoring the descendant differences, just triggering after a pointerdown or pointerup in devices that don't support hover i don't see anywhere describing the order
[10:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, we won't follow the spec here.
[10:30:21] <kborchers> oh
[10:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> Core has non-standard behavior for mouseenter and mouseleave in order to support delegation.
[10:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> You can't delegate the native events.
[10:31:15] <kborchers> right â€¦ so i should remove the code i just added to change bubbles to false for my pointerenter/pointerleave events? :)
[10:31:45] <Jack_q> scott_gonzalez is there something wrong in the source option of the autocomplete as im not able to get the element http://jsfiddle.net/Y4UJg/6/
[10:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yea, but you probably need more insanity in there.
[10:32:02] <kborchers> Jack_q: support is in #jquery
[10:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> Jack_q: The source has no specified context.
[10:33:06] <Jack_q> scott_gonzalez so im not gonna be able to do that?
[10:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> Not using this.
[10:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ask for help in #jquery or the forums.
[10:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I might have gotten this to work.
[10:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Is your branch not up-to-date with master?
[10:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> I have to `npm install` when I switch between master and your PR.
[10:45:33] <tj_vantoll> Odd, I thought it was.
[10:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, I'm getting notices with my solution.
[10:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, whoops. I was a on a 404 page.
[10:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, the moment of truth....
[10:49:59] <tj_vantoll> *drumroll*
[10:50:49] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...didn't work
[10:51:18] <scott_gonzalez> This is odd, since pages support categories.
[10:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you're not trying to set the category...
[10:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> You still have the <category> element in the content :-P
[10:52:12] <tj_vantoll> I copied from effects.html.
[10:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> And of course the easings page is doing the same.
[10:52:26] <tj_vantoll> er easings.html that is.
[10:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> So all of this might just be a wild goose chase.
[10:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> Let me test.
[10:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> What a joke.
[10:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> This has been working the whole time.
[10:54:23] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/0af1428d
[10:54:32] <tj_vantoll> Does the category just need to be in the <script> block?
[10:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'll fix easings.html in master.
[10:54:47] <tj_vantoll> Does it take a description as well?
[10:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then you can update your PR based on that.
[10:55:20] <tj_vantoll> Ok, excellent. Sorry for the goose chase.
[10:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Posts don't have descriptions.
[10:55:29] <tj_vantoll> kk
[10:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> The entry descriptions are just a convention we have in the XML.
[10:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's just part of the content.
[10:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> What did you want to do with a description?
[10:56:16] <tj_vantoll> http://api.jqueryui.com/category/utilities/
[10:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the text below the title?
[10:56:29] <tj_vantoll> Right
[10:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> Let me figure out what that is.
[10:56:53] <tj_vantoll> ok
[10:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> Excerpt
[10:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> You can provide that.
[10:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll put that in easings.html as well.
[10:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> Looks pretty bad with it showing up and using the default.
[10:58:36] <tj_vantoll> Perfect. I'll update the PR tonight.
[11:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably include easings in the effect category as well.
[11:03:25] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, it's more an effect than a utility.
[13:25:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi, are you still around?
[13:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I am.
[13:32:34] <agcolom> Hi! I was just going to ask you about icons in ui
[13:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> They shitty little raster graphics.
[13:32:54] <agcolom> It seems the only place to find some info regarding icons is the themeroller page
[13:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Did you hear that? She just said "Why is TJ such a slacker? When is he going to document all the icons?!?" :-P
[13:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yeah, we have a lack of documentation for all things theme-related.
[13:34:08] <kborchers> lol
[13:34:26] <tj_vantoll> :)
[13:34:41] <agcolom> Do you have plans for that?
[13:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> We probably should.
[13:35:19] <tj_vantoll> http://www.petefreitag.com/cheatsheets/jqueryui-icons/
[13:35:35] <agcolom> oh yes! 
[13:35:44] <tj_vantoll> Yeah this sort of thing is why I wanted a "Theming" category.
[13:35:55] <tj_vantoll> We should definitely have something like ^ on our API site directly.
[13:36:16] <agcolom> good also that people can select the icon name to copy and paste in their text editor
[13:36:43] <agcolom> I'd like to do that for mobile as well so was looking at what you had ;-)
[13:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of icons...
[13:37:38] <agcolom> yes?
[13:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/web-icons
[13:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> I started that while driving to NY.
[13:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, *I* wasn't driving.
[13:38:10] <tj_vantoll> lol
[13:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> I plan on creating a full page for each of the goals.
[13:38:25] <agcolom> Nice! 
[13:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> And then also pages for every known solution, along with an explanation of whether it satisfies each goal.
[13:39:01] <agcolom> Would be nice if icons could also scale according to font size... (or is that crazy?) 
[13:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/web-icons#scalable-to-any-size
[13:39:30] <agcolom> perfect ;-)
[13:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> By default they should adjust to match the surrounding text (color and size).
[13:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> This will of course become more clear once the more descriptive pages are written.
[13:40:23] <tj_vantoll> Have to get going for the day. I shall peruse later.
[13:40:31] <agcolom> this looks really good and promising!
[13:41:04] <evenicoulddoit1> scott_gonzalez looks cool - what format are you thinking then?
[13:41:12] <agcolom> for the size, I was thinking when people change the browser settings and override font sizes. 
[13:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> evenicoulddoit1: You mean what format for the docs or for the icons?
[13:42:32] <agcolom> I like the "display in any color" also!
[13:54:16] <evenicoulddoit1> scott_gonzalez the icons :)
[13:54:43] <evenicoulddoit1> I know it reads like that's what you're going to explore
[13:55:03] <evenicoulddoit1> But it looks like you've mentioned the whole array of options currently available
[13:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> evenicoulddoit1: There's only one potential solution I've come up with so far.
[13:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't have any idea how well it can be polyfilled.
[13:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> But it's SVG via Web Components
[13:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> So, right now that's 0% native market share
[13:58:34] <evenicoulddoit1> :P
[13:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> BUT, if it works, I think it addresses every goal.
[13:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> http://temp.nemikor.com/icon-test/
[13:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to view that in Chrome.
[13:59:54] <evenicoulddoit1> Just using Font Awesome, I noticed the SVG is _way_ bigger than the WOFF for instance though
[14:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh really? Why is that?
[14:01:04] <evenicoulddoit1> Not sure: FA's .woff = 34kb, .svg = 162kb
[14:01:36] <evenicoulddoit1> I know we're talking small sizes, but percentage wise it's pretty significant
[14:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I misread that.
[14:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you said it was way BETTER
[14:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> Which seems strange to me.
[14:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> The .svg gets compressed thought, right?
[14:03:25] <evenicoulddoit1> hmm, not sure 
[14:04:25] <evenicoulddoit1> You didn't mention size in your points to cover though, deliberate?
[14:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> I hadn't thought of it.
[14:05:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure I'd be able to quantify a value for that.
[14:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we could do it in terms of time to download over a given speed.
[14:09:41] <evenicoulddoit1> I think the webfonts are a huge improvements on traditional image sprites - the only thing they seem to lack in your list is multi-coloured
[14:10:26] <evenicoulddoit1>  / animations
[14:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> multi-color, accessible, dynamic, animated
[14:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> they are dynamic
[14:11:40] <evenicoulddoit1> They're pretty accessible too? IE8?
[14:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> accessible isn't related to browser support
[14:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> Icon fonts put random characters into the markup.
[14:12:11] <evenicoulddoit1> oh sorry, support I meant
[14:13:55] <evenicoulddoit1> But in the case of Font Awesome they use private use areas so as not to cause issues with screen readers I think
[14:16:34] <evenicoulddoit1> I suppose it would be nice to have a fallback / readable alternative
[14:24:19] <evenicoulddoit1> It looks like a great idea to explore anyway :) - night
