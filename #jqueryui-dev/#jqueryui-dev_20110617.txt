[08:09:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[08:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:10:16] <kborchers> do you have a minute, i think i am close to a solution for http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3532 but am stuck
[08:11:02] <kborchers> https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/381cba64746f15d9b99ff287e8f3a8ec941863d4
[08:11:33] <kborchers> http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YpFfN/ Seems to work except i lose the padding in the panes after a few mouseovers
[08:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> the team needs to come to an agreement on how that should work before we can land a fix
[08:13:14] <kborchers> in the meeting it seemed like people would like to see the animation stopped and then jump to last animation so thought i would give it a shot but i can leave it alone until a final decision
[08:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> well, what we were discussing isn't possible right now
[08:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> we were talking about stopping in the middle and starting the last animation also in the middle
[08:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> did you see the fiddle of the slide animation?
[08:16:12] <kborchers> yes, though if i quickly clicked it eventually the size would not return to original, it would increase to the last point the animation was stopped at
[08:18:57] <kborchers> boss is calling, brb
[08:45:50] <kborchers> out of curiosity, how woulde we start the last animation in the middle when it's a slide? if the pane is closed, wouldn't it have to jump to the middle before the animation started? wouldn't it look smoother if all of the previous animations jump to the end and the final animation runs its full length?
[10:17:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so, i couldn't leave it alone. ;) If you have time, I think this solution works pretty well and doesn't have to wait for jq1.7 and ui1.9.
[10:17:39] <kborchers> http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YpFfN/
[10:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that looks good
[10:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> nice job :-)
[10:23:10] <kborchers> should i submit a pull or would you rather wait and discuss at next meeting first?
[10:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> send a pull request
[10:23:51] <kborchers> will do
[10:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> even if we wait till the next meeting, it'll be good to have the pull request and this demo available
[10:24:27] <kborchers> ok sounds good. i'll add a link to the fiddle in the comments of the pull req
[10:25:11] <kborchers> i should probably also close my other pull req for this bug
[10:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> it's not perfect, but I think it's probably good enough because the user won't be looking at the part that is jerky from the .stop()
[10:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> if you add animated: "bounceslide" to the fiddle you can see it
[10:26:02] <kborchers> ok, i'll take a look
[10:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> but you have to look at the panel below the one that's closing while opening a higher panel
[10:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> so move your mouse up from the bottom
[10:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> and watch the lower panels
[10:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> but when you're actually looking at what you're doing, you don't even notice it
[10:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> because it's two panels away from you
[10:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, you can tell that *something* is jumping, but it doesn't jump out at you
[10:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> we could also decide to not let the user activate a panel during an animation like we had before
[10:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> and then this could only occur via a scripted change to the active option
[10:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really have strong feelings either way on that
[10:30:26] <kborchers> that could work too. i'll submit the pull and maybe the group can make a decision next week. it is a little more noticable too when the pane heights are taller with bounceslide http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/YpFfN/1/
[13:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, I really don't want to go down this road: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/369
[13:32:21] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to 1-8-stable: http://bit.ly/mggAY6
[13:32:21] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Tagging the 1.8.14 release. - Scott González
[13:32:21] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Updating the 1-8-stable version to 1.8.15pre - Scott González
[13:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh god
[13:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> build automation just went horribly out of control
[13:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> apparently piping the build script from curl straight into sh doesn't allow it to stop and wait for user input
[13:50:51] <kborchers> anyone know of css conflicts with jsfiddle? i'm trying to set up a fiddle of what i'm working on with menu but there are some display issues with icons and it appears some spacing issues with submenus.  thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/38wcx/
[13:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> use jquery-ui-git.css
[13:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> it's probably differences between 1.8.12 and master
[13:52:16] <kborchers> oh, ok. thanks
[13:54:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that did the trick, thanks!
[13:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[14:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> you know what makes this piping problem even worse? it makes perfect sense when you think about it :-/
[14:06:44] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: chalk it up to friday ;)
[14:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just glad it didn't break anything
