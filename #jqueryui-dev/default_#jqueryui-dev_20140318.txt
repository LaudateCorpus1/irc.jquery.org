[08:55:04] <agcolom> arschmitz: Hi, if I want to correct a typo in the wiki (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.5-Style-options-removal) can I just do this in the github editor? and do I need to add a messag?
[08:55:08] <agcolom> message?
[09:05:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You can just edit it and don't worry about the message.
[09:06:00] <agcolom> thanks!
[09:06:05] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: NP!
[09:06:21] <agcolom> are we just working on 1.5 right now?
[09:06:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I still have some PRs against both.
[09:06:55] <agcolom> (right ok. so 1.4.3 also?)
[09:07:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... but I've started working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6568, which is a 1.5.0-only modification.
[09:07:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, I think we're working on both.
[09:07:24] <agcolom> ok, thanks. 
[09:07:26] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: However, 1.4.3 has been quiet wrt. new bugs.
[09:07:38] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, cgack has been working on PRs against some older bugs.
[09:08:06] <agcolom> ok, that's great!
[09:13:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!

[12:17:16] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Hey! Could you please mention the bugs fixed by your commits as gh-nnnn instead of #nnnn?
[12:17:45] <_|Nix|_> cgack: We have adopted the convention that #nnnn refers to bugs on the trac system, whereas gh-nnnn refers to bugs on the github issue tracker.
[12:18:08] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Thanks a lot for the PRs, BTW!
[12:19:10] <cgack> _|Nix|_: I sure will.
[12:24:20] <cgack> _|Nix|_: anything I need to do for the existing PRs or should I just note this for the next ones?
[12:28:29] <_|Nix|_> cgack: Well, if you feel like rebasing them and editing the commit messages, it sure wouldn't hurt, but it's not super-essential.

[14:26:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[14:26:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[14:26:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[14:27:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now that buttonMarkup is gone, will a collapsible take all anchors and <button>s and add class ui-btn to them upon startup, or is it expected that they already have the class?
[14:28:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Until now, it called buttonMarkup() on its children: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/controlgroup.js#L30
[14:28:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the widget generate the anchor
[14:28:28] <uGoMobi> generates*
[14:28:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it didn't use buttonMarkup anymore already, right?
[14:28:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, it did.
[14:29:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought we removed all calls to buttonMarkup for 1.4
[14:29:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In master, if you do <div data-role="controlgroup"><a href="#" data-role="button">Blah</a></div> it would enhance the anchor.
[14:29:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, we had a few left over.
[14:29:55] <uGoMobi> hmm
[14:30:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think the widget should handle this now
[14:30:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, controlgroup was the only one that had a call left.
[14:31:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. So, this.element.find( "a, button" ).addClass( "ui-btn" )
[14:31:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, for now I think that is best solution
[14:31:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about navbar?
[14:32:47] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually not sure about navbar. All the unit tests passed after I removed buttonMarkup, so I haven't really concentrated on it.
[14:33:58] <uGoMobi> ok
