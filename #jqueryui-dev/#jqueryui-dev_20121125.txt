[07:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What's the status of getting dialog merged into master?
[07:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have a good sense of where things are right now (in general, not just for dialog) after being gone for pretty much the whole week :-/
[08:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> Finally, first pass through my inbox, down from hundreds to 36...
[08:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll hopuefully catch up on everything today/tomorrow. If anyone's waiting on a response from me and you don't get it by tomorrow, please just ping me again.
[09:12:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I want to land Kris' dialog PR before merging to master. His update is a much better, though there's still not unit test and we don't know the root issue. Since it now fixes the immediate issue, I'm probably just going to land that if I still can't find the root cause.
[09:12:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: for you to do: Review selectmenu!
[09:13:20] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: including everything, wiki page, demos, tests, docs (there's a branch on api.jqueryui.com)

[10:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Thanks, I just put selectmenu review high up on my list.
[13:00:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do we currently have a way to highlight warning paragrapghs? (I'm thinking of something along the lines of the yellow boxes in http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html but in a different colour... I just wanted to check with you whether if would be ok for me to try, and whether that is something you would need as well...  )

[13:53:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: when was the last time we had to push a release to patch an issue that a new jQuery Core release caused?
[14:06:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you comment here? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6016
[14:09:59] <agcolom> jzaefferer: Hi! which MVC framework would you recommend for a web app in JSP servlets and jQuery or jQuery Mobile (Struts2, Spring, other?) Thanks :)
[14:10:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: and here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/840
[14:11:19] <jzaefferer> agcolom: stay away from JSPs. As you're talking about Java, Wicket and Play come to mind as reasonable choices. I've never used Play, but would try that first, if I ever to Java web apps again.
[14:11:30] <jzaefferer> *ever have to
[14:11:53] <agcolom> jzaefferer: Thanks! will have a look at that.
[14:12:04] <jzaefferer> I think they're both Apache projects
[14:13:05] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: can you prototype your root key idea? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/827
[14:13:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: grunt testswarm:commithash:json_file_path:key
[14:13:50] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: here's my attempt at the warning paragraph... http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/orientationchange/ 
[14:14:17] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: then that key can be changed per job for branch specific stuff?
[14:14:30] <Krinkle> per jenkins job, yes.
[14:14:51] <jzaefferer> right
[14:14:53] <Krinkle> also allows different settings for "jQuery Mergatron" for example
[14:15:01] <jzaefferer> yeah, that should be useful
[14:15:04] <jzaefferer> let's do that
[14:15:04] <Krinkle> I'm thinking of creating a testswarm account for all pull requests.
[14:15:15] <Krinkle> regardless of which project
[14:15:33] <Krinkle> so that they don't go in between the history tables for the projects on testswarm.
[14:15:58] <Krinkle> it kind of touches on an little elephant in the room
[14:15:58] <jzaefferer> also a good idea.
[14:16:08] <jzaefferer> a little elephant?
[14:16:11] <Krinkle> do we want to use Jenkins or TestSwarm as primary CI entry point from dev perspective
[14:16:37] <Krinkle> If mergatron can do building of regular pushes as well (instead of just PRs) then we may be able to ditch Jenkins entirely
[14:17:20] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: a cat elephant? https://twitter.com/frolleinronja/status/272009290980655106/photo/1
[14:17:23] <Krinkle> All we need then is a way to publish the console output somewhere public so that we can look into errors prior to testswarm submission (the grunt build)
[14:17:33] <Krinkle> yeah, a cute one :)
[14:17:45] <Krinkle> I believe mergatron can already do that
[14:17:48] <Krinkle> mikesherov: 
[14:17:53] <jzaefferer> dunno
[14:18:00] <jzaefferer> I'm okay with Jenkins
[14:18:03] <Krinkle> meh, mikesherov isn't around
[14:18:15] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: well, it is a lot of framework and maintenance
[14:18:27] <Krinkle> It overlaps a whole lot with testswarm
[14:18:34] <Krinkle> (projects page, job history etc.)
[14:18:51] <jzaefferer> overlap, yes, but maintenance?
[14:18:51] <Krinkle> there is a few things missing , like the last run status on the dashboard. 
[14:19:17] <Krinkle> Well, if all we need is "grunt" and "grunt testswarm:<....>", I think it is silly to keep using testswarm.
[14:19:36] <jzaefferer> I need a "close duplicate tabs within this window" extension for chrome :/
[14:19:38] <Krinkle> jenkins*
[14:19:57] <Krinkle> anyhow, one step at a time
[14:20:20] <jzaefferer> I'm not attached to Jenkins, but there's still a bunch of value there
[14:20:34] <jzaefferer> I want to get this all green: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/ ...
[14:21:06] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: did you ever chat with any mobile folks? seems they couldn't care less about TestSwarm, which I don't understand :/
[14:21:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I've talked with them on various ocations
[14:21:36] <Krinkle> occasions*
[14:22:04] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: They're interested, but their test suite is pretty broken right now (could be only a few small things that look bad, or a lot of big hairy things, I don't know)
[14:22:28] <Krinkle> I've just reconfigured that job earlier this week and gave it a different set of browsers
[14:22:38] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerymobile
[14:23:20] <jzaefferer> I see. Just two failures in Chrome and Firefox, that isn't so bad
[14:23:31] <jzaefferer> Why Safari 4?
[14:25:25] <Krinkle> Someone told me to
[14:25:33] <Krinkle> It would resemble old iOS
[14:26:00] <jzaefferer> I'd kick that out until the other issues are resolved..
[14:26:32] <jzaefferer> And test against old iOS directly. If that's available.
[14:27:02] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: also, there seems to be an issue with the jenkins job for mobile swarm, I can't trigger it manually it seems
[14:28:07] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: can you see if can trigger a build
[14:28:26] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15datag opened pull request #842: Demos: autocompletion combobox fixes (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/pu_eag
[14:28:51] <jzaefferer> yeah, I can
[14:30:17] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: please do
[14:30:41] <jzaefferer> well, I just clicked to check if I can
[14:30:44] <jzaefferer> its scheduled
[14:30:55] <jzaefferer> I also checked permissions - you can do everything that I can
[14:30:57] <jzaefferer> are you logged in?
[14:31:36] <Krinkle> not in jenkins
[14:31:52] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I know how to trigger it
[14:31:55] <Krinkle> I mean, that it didn't work
[14:32:11] <Krinkle> it failed due to "environmental issues" "can only be triggered by github/git plugin"
[14:32:19] <Krinkle> the build failed
[14:32:21] <Krinkle> when I did it
[14:32:51] <jzaefferer> okay, that's weird
[14:32:54] <jzaefferer> which build was that?
[14:33:08] <Krinkle> moblie testswarm
[14:33:13] <Krinkle> I deleted the build in jenkins
[14:33:54] <jzaefferer> okay
[14:33:59] <jzaefferer> why would you delete it?
[14:35:08] <Krinkle> because... it was dirty :P
[14:35:23] <Krinkle> it was just a test

[14:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: One of the 1.8.20-something releases was needed for core 1.8 and 1.7.3 was released after we stopped doing 1.7.x releases to support core 1.4.something I think.
[14:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'm not sure if we have something right now, but I know there are other pages that need it to, so feel free to add one.
[14:41:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, thanks. 1.8 isn't that far back, at least 1.8.x releases got better.
[14:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: re: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6016 I had commented on the gist.
[14:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> Using .html() for the default is fine, because it's a hard-coded value so there's no vulnerability.
[14:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I think a light yellow may stand out better if the idea is to draw attention to it.

[17:50:08] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: yt?
[17:50:28] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: 
[17:50:31] <DaveMethvin> yep
[17:50:47] <kswedberg> hey!
[17:50:57] <DaveMethvin> hey howya doon?
[17:51:09] <kswedberg> good. you?
[17:51:20] <DaveMethvin> not bad, getting a bunch of 1.9 stuff done
[17:51:39] <kswedberg> awesome. 
[17:51:41] <kswedberg> so, what's the story with .andSelf() / .addBack()?
[17:52:08] <DaveMethvin> geez, another one of those things we didn't document very well
[17:52:16] <kswedberg> (or at all)
[17:52:20] <kswedberg> is .andSelf() deprecated as of 1.8? 
[17:52:21] <DaveMethvin> addBack is the preferred way as of 1.8
[17:52:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:52:26] <kswedberg> gotcha. 
[17:52:29] <DaveMethvin> both supported
[17:52:33] <kswedberg> and it has a new signature?
[17:52:45] <DaveMethvin> both have the same sig
[17:52:47] <DaveMethvin> oh did we change it?
[17:52:50] <DaveMethvin> let me look
[17:53:21] <kswedberg> takes a filter now.
[17:53:33] <DaveMethvin> oh yes we did
[17:53:48] * DaveMethvin looks sheepish
[17:53:57] <DaveMethvin> i have a 1.9 upgrade guide and can mention it there
[17:54:11] <DaveMethvin> tho technically it  happened in 1.8
[17:54:12] <kswedberg> no worries. @pobocks actually alerted me to it. 
[17:54:33] <kswedberg> we really need to make the new api.jquery.com live.
[17:55:00] <kswedberg> not sure anymore what the holdup is. I guess there is a whole new template/css scheme, but I've lost track. not sure that's even necessary.
[17:55:15] <kswedberg> brb. gotta tuck in my daughter.
[17:55:25] <DaveMethvin> ok bye
[17:56:56] <kswedberg> back
[17:58:11] <kswedberg> nacin: did you ever make any progress on porting my JSONP API search to the new site?
[18:14:23] <nacin> kswedberg: no :(
[19:06:09] <kswedberg> nacin: I'm still holding out hope. :)
