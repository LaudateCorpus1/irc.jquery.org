[00:44:23] <_zoggy_> so jui's accordion doesnt have any focus outline.. it does change the hover/focused sate of the inactive elements but nothing for the active

[15:08:30] <mikesherov> rworth: you there?
[15:08:55] <mikesherov> https://github.com/eduardolundgren/jquery-simulate is the original jquery-simulate. Should I contact that guy before moving forward?
[15:09:06] <mikesherov> I just don't want there to be any copyright issues
[15:09:15] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: ^
[15:27:23] <rworth> mikesherov I wrote the original simulate in jQuery UI. Eduardo and I both worked together on a complete rewrite (also in jQuery UI) which is what we have today
[15:27:34] <mikesherov> rworth: thanks
[19:21:55] <kborchers> rworth: holy moving! wow! congrats!
[19:22:03] <rworth> thanks :)
[19:23:45] <kborchers> rworth: that's a crazy turnaround! i applaud your ‚Ä¶ cojones :)
[19:24:03] <rworth> we didn't expect it, that's for sure
[19:24:07] <kborchers> we have seriously talked about moving to that very area. just can't pull the trigger
[19:24:14] <kborchers> my wife has family in Dallas
[19:24:15] <rworth> renting made it easy
[19:24:32] <rworth> as well as possible
[19:24:43] <kborchers> actually north of Dallas in Coppell
[19:24:49] <kborchers> that's awesome
[19:25:15] <rworth> we're very excited
[19:25:39] <rworth> and despite the suddenness, we've got enough time to get everything together
[19:25:55] <kborchers> cool! congrats again!
