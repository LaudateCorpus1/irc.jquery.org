[12:55:23] <bmatusiak> anybody having problem with sortable?
[13:09:59] <bmatusiak> any body even here
[13:33:30] <uGoMobi> bmatusiak: #jquery is channel for support, also for jQuery UI
[13:35:02] <bmatusiak> uGoMobi: out of 800+ idlers there no support being given. I see questions being asked but no responses 
[13:35:45] <bmatusiak> ok i do see 1 :P
[13:37:35] <maxlynch> uGoMobi, I assume the UI and mobile projects are merging, hence the IRC switch?
[13:37:52] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: eventually, yes
[13:37:59] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: this is just a first step
[13:38:29] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: cool, makes sense
[13:39:32] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: have you seen jquery.mobile.fastButtons before? I'm testing it out and seems to really improve responsiveness, but I'm sure there's a cost (scrolling, ghost taps, etc): https://github.com/justinmc/jquery.mobile.fastButtons
[13:41:45] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: no haven't seen it yet. we should test that
[13:44:25] <maxlynch> uGoMobi: yea, I'm going to be trying it out in some production apps, so I hope that should be a good test bed for it. I do remember that one issue with collapsible headings triggering clicks on content below it, so this probably has the same issue
[13:46:00] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: yeah I know that ticket. I wonder if all the button markup changes help too
[13:48:30] <uGoMobi> maxlynch: I also have to see if fastButtons is still relevant now we removed the buttonMarkup code
[13:48:46] <uGoMobi> but I guess in some widgets we still do things on click
[13:52:28] <maxlynch> Makes sense.
[14:37:57] <arschmitz> maxlynch: i would be VERY careful with that plugin i just looked at it and all it does is replace all click bindings with vclick
[14:39:15] <arschmitz> maxlynch: vclick has some pretty well documented issues when combinded with navigation or anything that moves. This is why we do not use it internally anymore for the most part. 
[14:39:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^
[14:40:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, good point
[14:40:23] <maxlynch> arschmitz, thanks. Is there anything I can read for more info on that? I've checked out some github issues (such as problems with collapsible headings and the page moving), but I considered the performance responsiveness improvement worth it on that one
[14:40:57] <arschmitz> maxlynch: for the most part its all in the issues
[14:41:06] <arschmitz> the real problems come when combined with page transitions
[14:41:42] <arschmitz> because the tap will fire on the correct element the transition will start and then the click will happen on the element that is on the new page in same spot
[14:42:00] <arschmitz> in theory in the right case this could cause an infinite navigation loop :9
[14:42:02] <arschmitz> :(
[14:43:26] <arschmitz> maxlynch: basicly for things that dont trigger anysort of visual change vlick is fine
[14:44:04] <maxlynch> arschmitz: Thanks for the heads up. I wonder how much mileage I could get out by trying to catch clicks after vclick within a certain delay and just cancel them?
[14:44:21] <arschmitz> but if it causes navigation or any sort of visual change where something else could end up under the target its not a very good idea
[14:44:41] <arschmitz> maxlynch: in that case you would just use tap
[14:44:49] <arschmitz> instead of vclick
[14:45:04] <arschmitz> but it will fail on desktop
[14:46:08] <arschmitz> maxlynch: there are lots of fast click solutions out there
[14:46:21] <arschmitz> but every one i have seen suffers from the same problems as vclick
[14:47:32] <arschmitz> maxlynch: its something we dont like much eaither ( the delay ) but so far we have not found something that can fix it with out causing major bugs 
[14:47:45] <arschmitz> or not working on desktop
[14:48:44] <arschmitz> maxlynch: if you find anything else or think you come up with something we are all for looking at it its something we would really like to improve
[14:52:27] <maxlynch> arschmitz: sure. I'm making it my mission to make jQM feel as native as possible
[14:52:29] <maxlynch> :)
[14:53:08] <maxlynch> My first thought is some of these trade offs could just be delegated to some config settings. For example if I'm building a native app, I don't care about desktop compatibility.
[14:55:20] <maxlynch> I'm going to experiment with it a bit, might publish a github repo with some stuff to play with
