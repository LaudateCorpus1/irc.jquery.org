[03:51:38] <jzaefferer> gnarf, I merged your jquery-docs branch and updated the build.xml, along with some reorganization: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-docs/commits/master
[07:56:08] <jzaefferer> gnarf, are you around?
[07:59:18] <jzaefferer> danheberden, are you around?
[07:59:33] <danheberden> more lately - been drinking a lot of beer
[07:59:49] <danheberden> oh A-round
[07:59:51] <danheberden> :p
[08:00:10] <danheberden> should we have our docs meeting in our jquery conference room? aka #jquery-meeting
[10:24:48] <gnarf> rworth / jzaefferer did you see my "gnarf" branch on scotts jquery-docs?
[10:25:15] <gnarf> i tweaked the xslt a little to support "options" on an entry
[10:29:42] <jzaefferer> merged that branch
[10:30:14] <jzaefferer> that tweak should be fine, but that's something where danheberden and rworth can tell you more
[10:32:47] <gnarf> k
[10:59:17] <denete> #team2
[11:00:09] <gnarf> umm
[11:00:15] <gnarf> #redteam ? :)
[13:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> is anyone able to reproduce this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7452
[13:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> also, gnarf will you be around tomorrow?
[13:23:39] <gnarf> lurking
[13:25:14] <gnarf> and scott_gonzalez - no dice on the reproduction
[13:25:22] <gnarf> chrome 13 or safari
[13:25:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, not sure what he's doing
[13:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:28:53] <gnarf> i should be here on and off
[13:29:11] <gnarf> was there something timed for tomorrow I'm forgetting? :)
[13:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> no, just wanted to go over some stuff tomorrow
[13:35:11] <gnarf> afternoon central I should be lurking most of the day
[13:35:23] <jonathansampson> scott_gonzalez: You guys don't keep records of past meetings, do you?
[13:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> jonathansampson: we do
[13:36:01] <jonathansampson> Public-facing?
[13:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://bit.ly/jqueryui-agenda
[13:36:25] <gnarf> jonathansampson: its also on the "Status Updates" rss
[13:36:39] <jonathansampson> Awesome, no chat logs though?
[13:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> no, but I'm sure you can find someone who has them
[13:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> should be easy to separate out since they're in a channel specific to meetings
[13:37:35] <gnarf> jonathansampson: http://jquery.org/updates/
[13:37:37] <jonathansampson> I though about recording them in a searchable medium but wasn't sure if it was already being done.
[13:37:48] <gnarf> is lampoon in #jquery-meeting?
[13:38:00] <gnarf> apparently not...
[13:38:15] <gnarf> danheberden: didn't someone do something about irc logs?
[13:38:15] <jonathansampson> gnarf: Thanks.
[13:38:37] <gnarf> i remember seeing a recent update about irc logging
[13:40:13] <jonathansampson> Googling "jQuery irc logs" turns up some bot logs.
[13:41:11] <gnarf> i know lampoon logs #jquery
[13:41:19] <jonathansampson> Yeah, there now.
[14:03:08] <danheberden> gnarf ya, jqlog is logging
[14:03:16] <danheberden> services.jquery.com
[14:03:20] <danheberden> still needs some work, tho
[14:03:26] <gnarf> jonathansampson: ^^^ ?
[14:04:16] <jonathansampson> Yo?
[14:04:36] <danheberden> jonathansampson services.jquery.com - crude logs, but they're there
[14:04:39] <gnarf> apparently jqlog is logging :)
[14:04:39] <jonathansampson> Whoa, nice.
[14:04:54] <danheberden> but you don't know what room each one is until you hover over and read the link url :p
[14:07:23] <jonathansampson> That would explain all the crazy duplicate dates.
[14:11:59] <gnarf> danheberden: is there a repo for that?
[14:13:47] <danheberden> gnarf, no - it's just an install of znc
[14:13:58] <danheberden> the web front needs to be moved/redone
[14:15:36] <gnarf> danheberden: roger
[14:16:42] <gnarf> maybe a calendar / select menu? :)
[14:19:18] <danheberden> gnarf, ya - i'd like to make it somewhat easy to use :p
[14:21:39] <jonathansampson> I know a UI framework for that ;)
[14:21:56] <gnarf> would be pretty easy to just ajax those files
[14:22:05] <gnarf> if we can replace the index.html
[14:22:39] <gnarf> wait, thats generated by a python script
[14:25:44] <danheberden> ya, it was clarkbox that did it - not quite sure what he did
[14:26:08] <danheberden> but we need the logs moved away from services - not sure what the best route to be, but a every 15 minute sync with jquery.org or something
[14:27:20] <gnarf> hrm
