[08:24:52] <jzaefferer> do we need to add JSHINT to the predef array for tests?

[13:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer, kborchers: Can you look over the position test sutie and see if you think there's anything missing?
[13:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> I removed a lot of tests today.
[13:10:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'll try to take a look tonight if i work ... been sick the last 3 days. at quick glance, that looked fun :P
[13:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, feel better.
[13:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Working on that was a blast. :-/

[14:13:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you think it would be possible to use a grid as a display for autocomplete? :)
[14:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> hahahahahahahaha
[14:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ask kborchers about arbitrary markup support for menu :-P
[14:51:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :/
[14:51:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it seems like such a useful UI :)
[14:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-examples/blob/master/autocomplete/table-display.html
[14:53:01] <gnarf> thats basically what i was thinking
[14:53:06] <gnarf> does that demo actually work? :)
[14:53:21] <gnarf> i take it from the commit comment that it doesn't
[14:53:22] <gnarf> :)
[14:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm honestly not sure if it works against master.
[14:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> 9 months ago it did not :-P
[14:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers spent a lot of time looking into it though.
[14:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> I forget how far he got.
[15:34:28] <gnarf> jzaefferer: do you have any issue with trying to switch to travis instead of jenkins?
[15:34:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i've been doing some research, and i think it will be able to do everything we do with jenkins and more
[15:35:07] <gnarf> but i just feel like its going to be less memory on the server
[15:40:08] <gnarf> considering its not on the server :)
[15:40:14] <gnarf> i dunno its a thought
[15:40:31] <gnarf> in the meantime - do you have a good guide for setting up a jenkins?

[18:53:01] <tj_vantoll> Not sure if anyone's around but I'm getting a JS error in testsuite.js when I try to run draggable's tests in master.
[18:53:17] <tj_vantoll> There were some commits related to that stuff today so I thought someone might want to know.
