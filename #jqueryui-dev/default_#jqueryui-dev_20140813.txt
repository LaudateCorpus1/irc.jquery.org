[05:12:31] <jzaefferer> arschmitz rxaviers: UI 1.11.1 is up on http://stage.jqueryui.com/ - could you help me click around and see if anything is off or missing?
[05:13:57] <rxaviers> I had
[05:14:05] <rxaviers> Ah nevermind.
[05:14:12] <rxaviers> I thought you were talking about the server migration.
[05:14:15] <rxaviers> Let me check...
[05:19:54] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: on it
[05:20:48] <rxaviers> Follow a gist of the changes from the downloaded 1.11.0 (via live) and 1.11.1 (via stage)
[05:20:54] <rxaviers> https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7317525762d38f2739a7
[05:21:14] <rxaviers> Maybe it's useful to check for specific changes...
[05:21:28] <rxaviers> For example: we don't have images/animated-overlay.gif on 1.11.1 anymore.
[05:23:21] <rxaviers> - I've checked a download using a different theme is reflected in index.html just fine
[05:23:47] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: ! just the guy I was looking for
[05:23:49] <mikesherov_> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9723
[05:24:14] <mikesherov_> this seems like notabug to me. http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9723#comment:2
[05:24:32] <tj_vantoll> *looking*
[05:25:36] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i checked the site the builder themeroller and the cdn and everything looks good to me 
[05:26:46] <rxaviers> - checked that CSS's reflects a theme downloaded using CSS scope. It happens though that index.html does not place user's scope by default. Although, if I edit it and add the scope (eg. I used a class ".foo"), it displays the theme just fine.
[05:26:57] <rxaviers> CSSes*
[05:27:03] <rxaviers> reflect*
[05:27:23] <arschmitz> rxaviers: did that work in 1.11.0 though?
[05:27:31] <rxaviers> same thing
[05:27:34] <arschmitz> ok
[05:28:01] <arschmitz> rxaviers: s5fs had to put off moving the server last night
[05:28:09] <arschmitz> he said probably tonight
[05:28:19] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov_: Well I could go either way. I could see wanting to use a margin to space draggables for an initial UI, and not want that margin to be taken into account once the user starts dragging.
[05:28:51] <rxaviers> arschmitz, ah! ok. s5fs, please just let me know 30min in advance.
[05:29:11] <arschmitz> rxaviers: he is going to start at 3pm eastern working on it
[05:29:23] <arschmitz> but there wont be anything to check for at least several hours
[05:30:22] <rxaviers> I'd like to be notified when he's deploying DB, so I could follow and assist in case he needs my help
[05:30:31] <rxaviers> well, at least I could.
[05:30:36] <rxaviers> It's up to you s5fs
[05:31:08] <arschmitz> rxaviers: he wont actually depoly
[05:31:21] <rxaviers> Im confused
[05:31:21] <arschmitz> hes just copying the server to a new box
[05:31:36] <arschmitz> so in theory it wont be much different then a restart
[05:31:46] <arschmitz> well plus a dns change
[05:31:50] <rxaviers> Isn't he re-deploying using puppet/
[05:32:11] <rxaviers> Is he going to copy the disk raw bytes?
[05:32:35] <arschmitz> he said some has to be done with rsync
[05:33:52] <arschmitz> rxaviers: but once he has the new server up ill make sure you know so you can check out anything you need
[05:34:02] <rxaviers> ok
[05:34:16] <arschmitz> or if he needs anything of course too
[05:34:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, 1.11.1 seems ok to me according to my above checks .
[05:35:27] <arschmitz> rxaviers: i dont know the exact details of how hes doing it i know they moved jq01 the wordpress server last weekand that at least went well
[05:35:28] <rxaviers> Im considering from 1.11.0 to 1.11.1 there was no new component
[05:35:44] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: sorry I got disconnected
[05:35:48] <rxaviers> arschmitz, ok
[05:36:45] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: yeah, I mean, I also can see a user wanting either way
[05:37:13] <mikesherov_> but wondering what the default should be vs. what the user wants
[05:37:31] <mikesherov_> also, this is the first report we've had of this in almost 5 years
[05:38:40] <tj_vantoll> mikesherov_: Yeah. I agree with sending it back to the OP to see his use case.
[05:39:32] <mikesherov_> so I'm inclined to to tell them: if you really want this, do $(el).draggable({ start: function(){ $(this).css('margin', 0); } });
[05:39:39] <tj_vantoll> As a user you can easily remove the margin, so the current behavior allows both.
[05:39:41] <mikesherov_> tj_vantoll: ^
[05:39:45] <mikesherov_> yeah
[05:39:46] <tj_vantoll> Exactly, you type faster :)
[05:40:25] <mikesherov_> ok, then I'm going to close this by adding a unit test proving that draggables respect margin on purpose for containment ;-)
[05:43:18] <tj_vantoll> cool
[05:45:58] <mikesherov_> oh, what do you know. I already test for that :-)
[05:52:59] <tj_vantoll> Nice :P
[05:58:34] <jzaefferer> mikesherov_ tj_vantoll: Could you review this 1.11.1 changelog on stage? http://stage.jqueryui.com/changelog/1.11.1/
[05:58:49] <tj_vantoll> *looking*
[06:01:30] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Looks good
[06:02:24] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: good, thank you. I'm working on the blog post now. Would be great to get a review of that as well
[06:03:04] <tj_vantoll> Sure
[06:09:32] <jzaefferer> and special thanks for the odd usernames to ixtli, jsonx, PRISMAY, pxc, r3dqu33n and rod333

[06:15:25] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: http://blog.jqueryui.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1266&action=edit&message=10 - links aren't working yet, pending deploy
[06:19:38] <jzaefferer> should be all good now
[06:19:54] <jzaefferer> all three deployments finished
[06:24:59] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Sorry. Reading now.
[06:27:03] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer: Straightforward. Looks good.
[06:27:19] <jzaefferer> Great, then I can publish or send the last few pieces
[06:27:42] <tj_vantoll> ‚Äúsend the last few pieces‚Äù ?
[06:29:10] <jzaefferer> blog post published, tweet sent, https://github.com/components/jqueryui/issues/39 submitted, emailed Andrew Nacin (to notify WordPress) and a PR for jsbin https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/pull/1836
[06:29:25] <jzaefferer> I think that's all there is: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/59346425/Release%20Checklist
[06:29:50] <jzaefferer> This time I only had to change one tiny thing on the release checklist
[06:35:48] <tj_vantoll> Nice!
[06:37:03] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: I won't be available for the meeting. I just updated the agenda though, can you run it?
[06:38:45] <tj_vantoll> Sure. Can you give me a link to the agenda?
[06:49:04] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgyHrN8YnS0IdER6clpleEd6WnBrRTgybnhUSTVMRUE#gid=31
[07:17:13] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: its also in the topic of #jquery-meeting, that's what I always click on
[07:17:57] <tj_vantoll> Ah. Good to know.
[07:48:02] <gseguin> arschmitz: PR for ?
[07:48:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: a few small bugs a found plus adding support for the second sig of .on
[07:49:05] <gseguin> arschmitz: ok
[08:08:54] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: my evening activity was cancelled, I'll be around for the meeting. I hope you can run it anyway :-)
[08:10:38] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the logic for disabled is really insane
[08:11:03] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: would be good to write that down in the spec, so that we can use that for API docs later
[08:11:16] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: when i was working on this it took me a while to wrap my head around what was happening and why certain tests were failing
[08:11:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah ill add that in exactly how the logic flow for that works
[08:11:46] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its actually needed on selectmenu too if im not mistaken
[08:13:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: oh and i need to update checkboxradio the same in spec as well
[08:58:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: Ping!
[09:33:05] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15jzaefferer opened pull request #1311: Build: Update jscs and fix some code style issues (06master...06grunt-jscs-update) 02http://git.io/4ir6_g
[10:05:42] <gseguin> arschmitz: pong
[10:06:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: hey so im having a crazy issue i cant figure out and running if you ran into it because it does not happen in your version
[10:06:25] <arschmitz> im getting blur events in the iframe when trying to change mouse position
[10:06:33] <arschmitz> with out a focus to go with them
[10:06:48] <gseguin> arschmitz: hmm... weird
[10:07:01] <gseguin> arschmitz: what platform / browser?
[10:07:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah its driving me nuts 
[10:07:22] <arschmitz> and yours does not do it
[10:07:32] <arschmitz> ios7 safari
[10:07:44] <gseguin> arschmitz: mine as in my index.html?
[10:07:45] <arschmitz> oh yeah its fine in chrome and firefox on desktop
[10:08:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: yours as in unaltered version of touchevents-fix.js
[10:08:25] <gseguin> wanna file that PR so I can look into it?
[10:08:35] <arschmitz> so i was wondering if it was wondering if you had run into this
[10:08:38] <arschmitz> sure
[10:10:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: fair warning i changed quite a bit lol 
[10:13:00] <gseguin> ok
[10:22:58] <gseguin> arschmitz: why did you remove the protection via the data attr on the iframe?
[10:29:23] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: any thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1311
[10:37:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: its not needed if you use a named function and use .off
[10:37:15] <arschmitz> and .data is very slow
[10:37:23] <gseguin> arschmitz: ok
[10:37:45] <jzaefferer> gseguin: do you know how to disable the coveralls bot commenting on GitHub PRs?
[10:38:05] <gseguin> jzaefferer: not on the top of my head
[10:38:09] <jzaefferer> gseguin: for example, we don't want this comment anymore: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/627#issuecomment-52080963
[10:38:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: did you file an issue about that
[10:38:25] <gseguin> jzaefferer: is there an option in the coveralls dashboard for it?
[10:38:36] <jzaefferer> I can't find anything. The notification settings on coveralls.io aren't set up, those seem unrelated to the bot
[10:38:42] <arschmitz> i thought you did? because i had brought up not wanting all the comments
[10:39:08] <gseguin> arschmitz: what I asked was to not report until the TravisCI build was complete
[10:39:22] <gseguin> it use to write a comment at the end of each job
[10:39:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: no this was after that but maybe we just talked about it
[10:39:39] <gseguin> let me look into it
[10:39:52] <jzaefferer> gseguin: nevermind, finally found it
[10:40:07] <gseguin> jzaefferer: oh good
[10:40:15] <gseguin> jzaefferer: was it in the dashboard?
[10:40:19] <jzaefferer> was at the bottom of their repo page, instead of under Notifications
[10:40:25] <gseguin> ok
[10:40:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: for the $.noop thing can you explain because there is nothing being returned or anything so i dont see the point?
[10:41:04] <gseguin> it was just to be explicit that we want nothing done 
[10:41:23] <gseguin> empty {} works too
[10:41:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok
[10:42:00] <arschmitz> i just removed it because while it makes not real speed difference i just didnt see the point in calling an empty function
[11:12:22] <tj_vantoll> http://jqueryui.com/download/ is broken for 1.11.1.
[11:12:24] <tj_vantoll> hmmmm
[11:12:39] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: hmm stage was yesterday
[11:12:45] <arschmitz> but that one was fine
[11:13:20] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yesterday rxavaiers just restarted the service
[11:13:39] <tj_vantoll> I'll email him.
[11:14:00] <arschmitz> oh yeah this is the same pretty sure
[11:15:13] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: im already in the server if you want me to restart the service
[11:15:59] <tj_vantoll> Seems like a good idea.
[11:28:37] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: fixed
[11:30:47] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Thanks! Could you mind reply to my email so J√∂rn and Rafael know?
[11:30:56] <arschmitz> sure
[12:15:26] <paul_irish> 1.11.1 should hit the CDN within a few hours
[12:36:20] <cgack> tj_vantoll: I was just able to test that ubuntu issue on ubuntu 12.04.
[12:36:48] <tj_vantoll> cgack: Could you recreate it?
[12:37:20] <cgack> I think so. (intermittently at least). Also on Fx on Windows (intermittent)
[12:37:28] <cgack> testing others as well
[12:39:58] <tj_vantoll> Hmmm.. I'll try Firefox on Windows.
[12:41:47] <tj_vantoll> I can't get it, but I'll mark the ticket as valid for now.
[12:42:27] <cgack> okay, i'll try to figure out a clear steps to reproduce
[12:43:16] <tj_vantoll> Awesome, thanks.
[12:55:18] <cgack> tj_vantoll: here's what I think it is - it is a combination of <shift>+<letter> then <shift>+<down arrow> which looks like its auto selecting only one when doing them quickly together
[12:56:18] <tj_vantoll> Just in certain browsers?
[12:57:25] <cgack> i can get it to do it in all that i've tried
[12:57:44] <cgack> chromium, fx on ubuntu and chrome, fx, ie on windows 8.1
[12:59:00] <tj_vantoll> It's probably worth asking the OP of that ticket whether they're using shift.
[12:59:40] <cgack> good point - an assumption i made with the 'C' in the description
[13:23:58] <gazza-911> can anyone tell me the url of the files I'd need for a userscript (using jQuery UI dialog)
[13:24:54] <gazza-911> woops, wrong channel
[14:28:59] <jzaefferer> Thanks paul_irish for the quick CDN upload
[16:15:45] <s5fs> rxaviers: MT has asked that we move jq02 and jq03 to different physical hardware, so I'm giving DO a try and moving jq02 over there first.
[16:15:56] <rxaviers> Hey s5fs
[16:16:02] <s5fs> rxaviers: I'm currently just getting started, gotta provision a vm and whatnot
[16:16:28] <rxaviers> are you starting with jq02.stage.jquery.com or jq02.jquery.com
[16:16:36] <s5fs> I'm really in no hurry, once I get it to the point that we have something testable I can ping you
[16:16:50] <s5fs> rxaviers: only jq02 and jq03 are affected, the staging machines are fine (iirc)
[16:17:04] <rxaviers> oh ok
[16:17:18] <rxaviers> do you estimate how long would it take so you ping me?
[16:17:18] <s5fs> yeah, we're not moving them for giggles haha
[16:17:59] <s5fs> i'm guessing a couple of hours
[16:18:57] <s5fs> anyways, we can review it before updating DNS. I've asked Alex to take a peek as well. Once I get something up and testable (or broken and needing help) I'll reach out.
[16:19:05] <rxaviers> ok
