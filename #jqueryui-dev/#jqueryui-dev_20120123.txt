[12:15:42] <peol> hey guys, i'm playing around with draggable/droppable and delay/distance… if i set a delay, the distance is ignored (i.e. i'd like it to be enabled if you mousedown a certain time), i need to move a pixel before it gets triggered. google gave me nothing so i thought i'd check here, is this known?
[12:15:59] <peol> this is with distance: 0
[12:16:45] <peol> scott_gonzalez: do you know if this has been discussed before, or should i perhaps fix it and PQ?
[12:16:52] <peol> PR*
[12:19:04] <peol> you can see what i mean here: http://jsfiddle.net/kgenZ/
[12:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> they should work together
[12:20:08] <peol> here's another one: http://jsfiddle.net/kgenZ/1/
[12:20:22] <peol> last li works, first one doesn't (need to move a px)
[12:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> oh, I see what you mean
[12:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> You need to actually move after the 500ms in order for another event to come along and cause the code to run again.
[12:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> I agree that shouldn't happen.
[12:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be hesitant to land a fix though, since it changes behavior.
[12:22:02] <peol> yeah, i agree, such a pain to monkey patch :D
[12:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> We can make sure not to have that problem in the new interaction layer
[12:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping we can figure out a way to avoid baking those into the underlying logic
[12:23:04] <peol> wouldn't mind normally, but i'm simulating a "burn" on a touch device, so there's a transition from white -> red, and then delay's met and the user can drag it out
[12:23:18] <peol> scott_gonzalez: ah, yeah that would be great. do you want me to submit an issue for 1.x?
[12:23:29] <peol> 1.9*
[12:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> You can file an issue against 1.8.x
[12:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> But it's just going to stay open until 2.0.
[12:24:08] <peol> yeah no worries, i'll just add it so it isn't forgotten :)
[12:24:11] <peol> thanks for the help
[12:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> If you can think of a way to decouple distance/delay from the underlying logic that'd be awesome
[12:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't like the fact that they have to be implemented inside mouse.
[12:25:45] <peol> it would be cool to actually have that build-in to the event system (special event to delay firing actual event), so it's just plain event binding
[12:27:23] <peol> so $('foo').bind('delayedmousedown', { delay: 500 }, callback) or some such
[12:27:39] <peol> i'll and it in the issue
[12:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> That wouldn't actually help us.
[12:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> We need to bind to the real event so we can preventDefault()
[12:29:45] <peol> could optionally be built-in as event-data as well, { delay: 500, preventDefault: true, stopPropagation: true } // defaults
[12:29:47] <peol> or some such

[14:21:27] <clarkbox> jenkins is out of control again
[14:21:27] <bot-t> (26 hours 10 mins ago) <kborchers> tell clarkbox browserstack looks down. what did you break? :P jk
[14:21:51] <clarkbox> kborchers, is that what you meant?
[14:21:58] <clarkbox> or was browserstack.com down?
[14:22:21] <clarkbox> or was it just my script that was not kicking off browserstack workers after a jenkins build?
[14:22:29] <clarkbox> im guessing the latter...
[14:23:46] <clarkbox> in which case, i dont have the script hooked up to cron yet. was waiting to get worker state hooked up. as of now, the script just blindly kicks off browsers based on what work needs done. so if i cron'd it for an arbitrary amount of time, it may queue browsers even though they are already started
[14:24:21] <clarkbox> i was planning on finishing it off this weekend - but was side tracked by some spontaneous partying
[14:26:50] <clarkbox> going to restart jenkins
[14:29:20] <clarkbox> something is fucked... cant get it back
[14:30:59] <clarkbox> k, its back
[15:30:20] <kborchers> clarkbox: browserstack was actually broken. It just kept getting stuck on "Finding nearest cloud location." Definitely not something you did, just a joke. :)
[15:35:24] <clarkbox> ah i see
[15:35:48] <clarkbox> you were right tho... things were broken
[17:38:16] <clarkbox> updated popup to support multiple trigger elements https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/582
[17:38:17] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by clarkbox (1m, 21s ago): popup's trigger option now supports multiple elements
[17:39:23] <clarkbox> ping jzaefferer scott_gonzalez
[17:50:20] <kborchers> clarkbox: just a superficial look at that pull ... it seems ok in my head but i haven't tested. one thing though, can you clean up the white space? just looks like a lot of extra space at the beginning of lines and some extra white space at the end of line 116
[17:50:59] <clarkbox> must be inconsistent tab spacing issue. ill fix.
[17:51:07] <kborchers> yeah, that's what it looks like
[17:51:52] <clarkbox> is it possible to update a pull request with new commit? or do i have to submit a new one with new commit?
[17:52:14] <kborchers> yeah, if you push to that same branch it will add the commit to the PR
[17:52:30] <clarkbox> ok. thanks.
[18:03:40] <clarkbox> kborchers, have a look now
[18:05:13] <kborchers> clarkbox: looks good! i'll see if i can get an actual review of that PR done tonight but i have some client work that has to get done so may not be able to. thanks for fixing that!
[18:05:27] <clarkbox> cool, thanks.
[18:07:15] <kborchers> clarkbox: also, fyi. check out http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137724/Bug-Fixing-Guide specifically, the part on the commit messages since i just noticed yours are not properly formatted
[18:07:37] <clarkbox> thanks for heads up
[18:09:07] <clarkbox> will edit message accordingly
[18:10:59] <clarkbox> ...done
[18:13:32] <kborchers> clarkbox: the PR title and message aren't as important as the actual commit messages though which is what that document is referring to.
[18:13:58] <clarkbox> ya i realized that... i guess i cant edit that.
[18:14:25] <kborchers> you can do it but it's a pain ... just see if any of the other guys want you to change otherwise just leave it
