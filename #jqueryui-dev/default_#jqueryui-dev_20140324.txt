[12:04:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: Ping!
[12:04:19] <gseguin> yo
[12:04:32] <gseguin> what's up arschmitz ?
[12:04:33] <arschmitz> hey i was just looking at amd deps for slider and rangeslider
[12:04:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: shouldnt rangeslider just have slider there
[12:04:44] <gseguin> yeah I was looking at that PR too
[12:04:55] <arschmitz> and slider has everything rangeslider needs
[12:04:58] <gseguin> that's what I was wondering
[12:05:09] <arschmitz> rangeslider has no additional deps
[12:05:20] <gseguin> but if it's using it directly it should require as well
[12:05:21] <arschmitz> so just saying slider should be good enough right?
[12:05:31] <Krinkle> arschmitz: I got a bit of availability this week if you need me for testing stuff (and I'm in the US for three weeks as of yesterday, so timing should be better, I'm in SF)
[12:05:44] <gseguin> not if it's using events/touch directly
[12:06:03] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok
[12:06:19] <arschmitz> well i think everything in there is used directly so it should stay
[12:06:42] <arschmitz> Krinkle: awesome yeah when ever you have time to point me in the right direction to start getting it setup im pretty much always available
[12:07:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: actually not textinput
