[12:52:51] <erichynds> I'm not able to download a custom build or the "quick download" stable :| the zip file only downloads to 65k and is corrupt.
[12:54:04] <erichynds> I'd very much like to download all the things
[12:54:25] <kborchers> erichynds: hmm, works for me
[12:54:30] <erichynds> hm.
[12:54:40] <erichynds> that's upsetting
[12:55:01] <kborchers> that's weird
[12:55:32] <erichynds> http://erichynds.com/i/a9cfae.png
[12:55:38] <erichynds> connection keeps closing
[13:02:26] <kborchers> erichynds: http://gyazo.com/b5aa3aac266e8379df2f505285f41d7e.png
[13:02:36] <kborchers> very strange
[13:02:46] <erichynds> indeed.
[13:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> erichynds: can you view the content of the zip?
[13:03:09] <erichynds> i cannot
[13:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> does it actually contain zip content or HTML?
[13:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok
[13:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> I know other people have been having the problem too
[13:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> but like kborchers, I haven't been able to reproduce it locally either
[13:03:54] <kborchers> erichynds: yeah, looks fine here
[13:04:20] <erichynds> this is what it says when I try to open it: http://erichynds.com/i/eeb58f.png
[13:04:32] <erichynds> if I let wget go long enough though, it eventually downloads the entire thing
[13:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> when it downloads the whole thing can you unzip it?
[13:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> if you cat the file, do you see HTML or jibberish?
[13:06:54] <erichynds> I can unzip it once the whole thing downloads
[13:07:19] <erichynds> i see jibberish when cat'ing the partial download from a browser

[14:02:48] <danheberden> download issues should be resolved
[14:02:50] <danheberden> free space problems again
[14:02:53] <danheberden> or, rather
[14:02:55] <danheberden> are getting resolved
[14:03:01] <danheberden> once the box is done with the operation
