[05:36:26] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by michael-lang (23m, 12s ago): Initial listbuilder addition
[05:37:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137993/ListBuilder#comment1290446057 just two years later...
[05:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> So he did what I said :-)
[05:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> I never said that it should be in the main jquery-ui repo. I specifically said it should be in a fork.
[05:40:59] <jzaefferer> So, let's close the PR and continue the discussion on the wiki page?
[05:41:37] <jzaefferer> ah, you closed already
[05:45:09] <jzaefferer> I thing I noticed in his code: He's not using _bind or other widget-inherited methods, but then I've got nothing to link that shows whats available
[05:45:25] <jzaefferer> Didn't kborchers want to work on that?
[05:46:29] <kborchers> what did i want to work on jzaefferer?
[05:46:35] <kborchers> please say .box()
[05:47:14] <jzaefferer> Get _bind and others on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/54092424/Widget
[05:47:27] <jzaefferer> if you can sneak _box into $.Widget, add that, too :p
[05:47:54] <jzaefferer> once its on there, we also want it in the widget api docs
[05:48:09] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i just haven't had a chance. got distracted with some menu todo's that scott_gonzalez had and then haven't gotten back to it
[05:48:25] <kborchers> jzaefferer: also looking into your menubar issue
[05:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Why does ARIA suck so much?
[05:49:08] <kborchers> we have changed a number of things so not sure what's broke. i know i removed the delay when using keyboard nav and we moved some stuff around so could be a number of things
[05:49:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's so low level.
[05:52:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: no tweet for 1.8.21?
[05:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> I was waiting for the morning when people are paying attention.
[05:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> Still a bit early for that.
[05:53:18] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:14:43] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I've started something: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/54092424/Widget
[06:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you address this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7345
[06:24:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thanks ... i should hopefully be able to continue where you started tonight. that helps a lot since i was also having a little trouble with the best way to organize that page being that it's more than just about widget.js
[06:29:13] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer: I ran into a couple problems while working on the api.jquery.com index template (in web-base-template).
[06:30:47] <kswedberg> 1. we want to show an excerpt of each entry, but WP's the_excerpt() doesn't work for our needs, because it pulls it from the body field.
[06:31:36] <kswedberg> we want just the <desc> node from the xml.
[06:31:45] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: We can create a custom function to do what we need, or we might be able to just massage the data so that the_excerpt() works properly for us.
[06:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check how the_exceprt() works.
[06:32:30] <kswedberg> WP has a post_excerpt field in the wp_posts table. It would be awesome if we could just stick the <desc> node into that.
[06:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that.
[06:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> It might be a bit tricky for us to get the data there, but grunt-wordpress supports it.
[06:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check out the processing that we're doing now.
[06:34:31] <kswedberg> ok. cool
[06:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it shouldn't be too hard.
[06:35:37] <kswedberg> great
[06:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Can you add it to https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L27
[06:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> The key is "excerpt".
[06:37:00] <kswedberg> sure. I can try. :)
[06:38:17] <kswedberg> one other thing… http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[06:39:33] <kswedberg> on the live site now, we're using the title field in the wp-admin for the entry headings. we don't have that title entered anywhere in the new xml
[06:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's the line that I linked to.
[06:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> "title": "<xsl:value-of select="//entry/@name" />",
[06:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I'm misunderstanding.
[06:44:39] <kswedberg> right. but that says, for example "attributeContains" instead of "Attribute Contains Selector"
[06:45:09] <kswedberg> we don't have a "friendly name" in the xml
[06:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> So is the data wrong or are we missing data?
[06:45:19] <kswedberg> we're missing data
[06:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: There's no easy way to pull the old data again is there?
[06:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> Since we've made updates to the XML.
[06:47:05] <rworth> the data can easily be exported from WordPress
[06:47:05] <rworth> as xml, then walked and merged
[06:48:18] <rworth> kswedberg: is the data a piece of post metadata then, not in the xml content?
[06:49:03] <kswedberg> rworth: the data is the post_title field in the wp_posts table
[06:49:38] <rworth> ok, let me see
[06:49:50] <kswedberg> thx!
[06:52:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding Docs: Add note that widgets require functional CSS - just a generic note, or anything widget-specific?
[06:52:32] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez, rworth: how is the entry slug being generated?
[06:52:45] <rworth> filename
[06:52:54] <rworth> less extension
[06:53:04] <kswedberg> oh, of course. haha. :D
[06:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: A generic note should be fine. As long as it shows up in each widget's page.
[06:53:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[06:54:29] <jzaefferer> how about this: This widget requires some functional CSS, otherwise it won't work. If you build a custom theme, use the widget's specific CSS file as a starting point.
[06:56:44] <scott_gonzalez> seems good
[06:56:58] <jzaefferer> I can just copy&paste that into each one then
[06:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:58:48] <jzaefferer> well, rename widget to interaction for resizable and selectable

[07:08:31] <jzaefferer> Thanks to Yehuda, QUnits stacktrace support got even better. https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/171ad8f042007e795766893a701d9315bdedeef1
[07:08:32] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on qunit by jzaefferer (2d, 3h ago): Improve extractStacktrace() implementation. Fixes #254 - Include all relevant stack lines
[07:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccccccciiiinnn
[07:08:47] <jzaefferer> It'll now give you the full stack outside of qunit itself
[07:08:56] <jzaefferer> not just one line
[07:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[07:09:30] <jzaefferer> and for exceptions, tells you what line to find the test itself
[07:09:40] <jzaefferer> time to release 1.7
[07:12:12] <jzaefferer> this could land before 1.7: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/207
[07:12:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #207 on qunit (scottgonzalez; 3m, 4d ago): Add option to require all tests to call expect()
[07:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'll try to get to that today.
[07:18:36] <jzaefferer> Having someone else somewhat familar with the QUnit codebase is certainly a big plus for that :-)
[07:31:12] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[07:31:13] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #502: FIXED in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/502/
[07:31:13] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Datepicker: Pulled event handlers into static code. Fixed #3945 - DatePicker does not respond to any click events in AIR, Google Sites, Windows Metro.
[07:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you have a preference on the QUnit config?
[07:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> config.requireExpects?
[07:48:44] <jzaefferer> config.highExpectations
[07:48:46] <jzaefferer> :p
[07:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:48:57] <jzaefferer> config.requireExpects works
[07:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> How should this get set? Another checkbox?
[07:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking we'd do it directly in UI.
[07:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit.config.requireExpects = true;
[08:32:15] <jzaefferer> Yeah, one liner should be fine
[08:32:34] <jzaefferer> Also highlight me if I don't respond after a minute ;)
[08:54:13] <jzaefferer> ooh, agenda alread updated :-)
[08:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:29:02] <rworth> kswedberg titles added
[09:29:11] <kswedberg> awesome!
[09:29:14] <kswedberg> thx!
[09:29:17] <rworth> np
[09:29:55] <kswedberg> I ran grunt again, and I'm not seeing any pretty <pre> blocks. Is pygmentize running ok for you?
[09:30:28] <kswedberg> rworth: ↑
[09:30:53] <rworth> are you looking at examples/demos ?
[09:31:09] <rworth> caus most of the pre's need to be turned into <pre><code>s still
[09:31:33] <rworth> I only did add.xml so far https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/commit/c48c5e422bf01edeac74699b20205567fe2be902
[09:31:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on api.jquery.com by rdworth (1d, 20h ago): Up pygmentize to 0.5.1. Updated add.xml to have <pre><code> not just <pre> for para-inline code blocks.
[09:31:52] <kswedberg> ah. ok.
[09:32:17] <rworth> but the ones generated by the xsl should be working
[09:32:59] <kswedberg> oh wait. after running `grunt` I need to run something else, like `grunt wordpress-deploy` or something like that, right?
[09:33:14] <rworth> `grunt deploy` works
[09:33:19] <kswedberg> cool deal
[09:33:39] <kswedberg> that was the problem. :)
[09:33:43] <rworth> :)
[09:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Why `grunt deploy` instead of `grunt wordpres-deploy`?
[09:36:27] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: grunt.registerTask( "deploy", "wordpress-deploy" );
[09:36:37] <jzaefferer> just shorter to type
[09:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's annoying because wordpress-deploy exists specifically so that we don't have to create custom deploy tasks in each repo.
[09:46:18] <jzaefferer> ben_alman: right, but you could publish one of them, right?
[09:46:29] <ben_alman> sure
[09:46:40] <ben_alman> or i could create a new one for testing
[09:46:48] <ben_alman> or whatever
[09:46:49] <jzaefferer> grunt init:jquery? :p
[09:46:54] <ben_alman> ya
[09:47:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what's missing to publish a plugin on stage, no CLI?
[09:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> well, staging for one :-P
[09:48:12] <rwaldron> hi. brb
[09:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, we need to implement the post-receive hook.
[09:48:29] * rworth needs to get lunch as well
[09:48:53] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you create an issue for that and describe what you know about it?
[09:49:01] <jzaefferer> I gotta go, ttyl
[09:49:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm working on jQuery servers this afternoon
[09:50:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so - if you have any requirements that aren't yet met, lets hash em out
[09:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not quite ready to stage the plugins server. I'll let you know when I am.
[09:50:46] <gnarf> okie
[09:51:11] <gnarf> I think I'm gonna try for the front end proxies today
[10:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Not sure if you want a test for this (not sure how to test it): https://github.com/scottgonzalez/qunit/commit/c30b257d9fd51e77d5bb73941f64147007b293a3

[10:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> If it's good as is, I'll push to qunit/master

[10:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I just created a ticket for the _bind() problem that we noticed the other day: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8385
[10:27:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, that's a big problem ... still not sure of the best way to handle it
[10:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> Me neither :-(
[10:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> But we definitely can't release with it.
[10:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> We might need to track individual functions.
[10:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't even think that will help.
[10:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> Because most likely we'd be binding the same function.
[10:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> We might need to do what we were talking about with a single event handler that tracks the instances.
[10:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda annoying though.
[10:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I did that for one of the interaction rewrites.
[10:31:35] <scott_gonzalez> yup, pretty similar: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.droppable.js#L17-50
[10:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we can make that easier and track instances for all widgets automatically?
[10:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't think the overhead would be too high.
[10:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Just an array of pointers.
[10:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> We could have $.ui.droppable.instances.
[10:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...
[10:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I implemented something like that already.
[10:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I've got _childConstructors()
[10:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh right, I think I went down the road of tracking instances and decided that extending a constructor after instances have been created is total insanity.
[10:48:47] <gnarf> so um
[10:48:52] <gnarf> whats the issue?
[10:48:55] <gnarf> i read the bug
[10:49:06] <gnarf> but like _unbind blows up all the events?
[10:49:26] <gnarf> not just the ones for your instance?
[10:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let me find an example.
[10:51:06] <gnarf> hrm
[10:51:20] <gnarf> add uuid to the namespace?
[10:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L126
[10:51:33] <gnarf> when binding to an object not the widget?
[10:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That's not a bad idea.
[10:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> Give all instance a uuid and use it in the namespace.
[10:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> We should very rarely be binding directly and specifying the namespace now anyway.
[10:52:12] <gnarf> seems to do what you want - but then you also might need a "global bind" too
[10:52:19] <gnarf> like for a droppablemanager
[10:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I think for those cases though, they'll be outside the widget instance anyway.
[10:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> Just bound directly on page load.
[10:52:52] <gnarf> agree
[10:53:58] <gnarf> if we standardize on using _bind and _unbind
[10:53:59] <gnarf> always
[10:54:06] <gnarf> btw
[10:54:13] <gnarf> do on/off make more/less sense?
[10:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> Here comes the _on
[10:54:30] <gnarf> ?shrug
[10:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we can make the change.
[10:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> Even though internally it will use .bind() for a few years :-P
[10:54:59] * gnarf nods
[10:56:01] <gnarf> mind reader....
[10:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: I documented all the internal widget methods on the wiki: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/54092424/Widget
