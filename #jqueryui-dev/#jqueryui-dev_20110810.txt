[02:17:47] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/mask] Mask: Updating visual test - Corey Frang
[02:37:04] <gnarf> jzaefferer: are we using .widget( "value" ) as a raw value, or decorated value
[02:37:08] <gnarf> i saw that commit comment
[02:37:23] <gnarf> cuz in mask, its returning the "unmasked" value
[02:37:34] <gnarf> i don't wanna step on a standard
[02:47:29] <gnarf> hrm
[02:47:33] <gnarf> anyone awake?
[02:54:42] <jzaefferer> gnarf: what does 'unmasked' mean?
[02:55:01] <gnarf> without the mask literals
[02:55:13] <gnarf> so if you had 111-11-1111
[02:55:19] <gnarf> it wouldn't have the -
[02:55:30] <gnarf> if you want the actual formatted value you can just grab it from .val()
[02:55:44] <gnarf> i didn't see much point in implementing that as a public method
[02:55:46] <jzaefferer> sounds like that would match what's proposed for spinner
[02:56:02] <gnarf> yeah id expect a number from spinner
[02:56:04] <gnarf> right?
[02:56:08] <jzaefferer> yeah
[02:56:21] <jzaefferer> is there a value option for mask?
[02:56:30] <gnarf> its the value of the input
[02:57:05] <gnarf> but value method can be called as a setter too
[02:57:30] <gnarf> i hadn't made a value option yet
[02:57:36] <gnarf> do i need one?
[02:58:24] <gnarf> or if you call .mask({ value: "123456789" }) should that be the same as .mask( "value", "123456789" ); ?
[02:58:38] <gnarf> if not, should we adopt that?
[03:01:56] <jzaefferer> makes we wonder why spinner even has a value option
[03:02:00] <jzaefferer> mask doesn't need one
[03:02:04] <jzaefferer> autocomplete doesn't have one
[03:02:45] <jzaefferer> does mask have a refresh method?
[03:03:26] <gnarf> yes
[03:03:36] <gnarf> ill add it to the spec
[03:04:22] <jzaefferer> spinner has refresh, too
[03:04:41] <jzaefferer> so you can always do .val(123).spinner("refresh")
[03:04:53] <jzaefferer> if that refresh is even necessary
[03:05:20] <gnarf> yeah, it is for mask
[03:05:33] <gnarf> or you can .mask("value", 123)
[03:05:58] <gnarf> which basically does a .val( value ).mask( "refresh" )
[03:07:21] <jzaefferer> did another comment on that commit, let's see what Scott has to say about that
[03:09:31] <gnarf> you think we can talk about functional specs for timepicker at some point today?
[03:10:06] <jzaefferer> can do that
[03:10:32] <jzaefferer> though I'm wondering if we and put together a prototype first, that takes the existing timepicker demo and modifies step based on the caret position
[03:10:50] <gnarf> timepicker demo?
[03:10:56] <gnarf> the one that uses 3 spinners right now?
[03:11:19] <gnarf> I'd almost rather just start one from scratch, with a spinner
[03:11:31] <gnarf> and then borrow some mask proto funcs
[03:11:49] <gnarf> the careting is a little different in the timepicker land
[03:11:57] <gnarf> cuz you want left and right to "select" multiple values
[03:11:58] <gnarf> etc
[03:12:36] <gnarf> like when you focus, put the highlight on "07" out of "07:08:09"  -- right arrow highlights 08 right?
[03:15:26] <gnarf> right arrow highlights 08 and changes step to 60
[03:17:17] <gnarf> hrm
[03:17:32] <gnarf> does spinner have a "mod" option?
[03:18:07] <gnarf> like if i go from 59 minutes to 0 minutes it shouldn't adjust hours right?
[03:31:53] <gnarf> afk a bit
[03:51:33] <jzaefferer> was referring to this demo: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/spinner/time.html
[03:51:43] <jzaefferer> broken right now
[03:52:08] <jzaefferer> yeah, overrides _parse and _format to old API
[03:52:40] <jzaefferer> btw. now that mask is mostly complete, could you ask Josh if he could do some testing?
[04:17:14] <gnarf> how do you feel about those two proposed options on mask? the "clear" and "invalidate" are the best names i can come up with atm
[04:25:49] <gnarf> hrm
[04:26:00] <gnarf> this gives me an idea of how to handle "multi character" masks
[04:29:19] <gnarf> hrm, should timepicker be using this $.global ?

[05:15:09] <gnarf> btw, i don't think I'm gonna make the meetings today, not a ton to report on anything right now - would like some eyes on mask if people have time to give opinions on the discussion points in the wiki that'd be nice :)

[05:37:53] <jzaefferer> gnarf: meetings cancelled for today
[05:37:59] <jzaefferer> dunno how to announce that...
[05:39:08] <jzaefferer> gnarf: looking at wiki page now; was also planning to update master to use Globalize, need that for grid-editing stuff as well
[05:42:01] <jzaefferer> gnarf: where do you mention those options on the wiki? don't see that anywhere

[05:43:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid Editing: Remove refresh binding, wasn't ever functional thanks to typo and not needed anyway. - Jörn Zaefferer
[05:52:46] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, looks like you broke pretty much all the demos using $.global
[05:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[05:53:02] <jzaefferer> which may indicate that the spinner unit tests don't cover that at all
[05:53:10] <jzaefferer> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/spinner/decimal.html
[05:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[05:53:43] <jzaefferer> I'm replacing $.global with Globalization, I get the same results as before
[05:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> yes, apparently not covered by unit tests since I made sure they were all passing
[05:53:50] <jzaefferer> so gonna push that anyway
[05:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into right now, unless you're already doing that

[06:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I hate you :-P
[06:15:35] <jzaefferer> wha?
[06:15:47] <jzaefferer> what new reason now?

[06:16:01] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Spinner: Fixed integration with globalize. - Scott González
[06:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> you forgot to update the test to use Globalize
[06:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> took me a while to figure out why the tests were failing
[06:16:41] <jzaefferer> ah, oops
[06:16:52] <scott_gonzalez> ripping out the value option is gonna be interesting
[06:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> I should be able to do that this week though
[06:18:07] <jzaefferer> the time demo is still broken
[06:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> checking now
[06:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, the time demo extends the spinner and changes internal methods
[06:19:27] <jzaefferer> also need to merge https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/426
[06:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> fixed

[08:35:08] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yt?
[08:55:19] <kborchers> ?tell jzaefferer I'll be in another meeting during the UI meeting so may not be able to give an update. TODO's here http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu pretty much sum up where I'm at if you need to give my update. Thanks
[08:55:20] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[10:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> can we just take down jqueryui.com?
[10:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> it's such a pain to fix :-P
[10:33:53] <kborchers> heh
[10:35:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you can download from the CDN and 90% of people don't read the docs so I don't see why not ;)
[10:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> the demos are especially problematic
[10:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> there's a lot of black magic going on
[10:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> fragile black magic
[10:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> which is currently broken
[10:36:19] <kborchers> that sucks ... is that what prompted the meeting cancelation?
[10:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> no, we were just all unavailable at noon
[10:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> check this out
[10:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> go to http://jqueryui.com.local/demos/dialog/#modal-form
[10:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> then click on the Animated dialog link on the right
[10:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> the demo doesn't work
[10:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> and if you view source, the default demo code is loaded
[10:39:46] <kborchers> hmmm, seemed to work for me though your link didn't work so had to get there a different way
[10:39:55] <kborchers> .com.local
[10:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> hah, you drop the .local
[10:40:55] <kborchers> oh, it breaks if you link directly to the demo but if you go to the default page first it works
[10:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, if you start on a specific demo, then switch to the animated demo it doesn't work
[10:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, SVN is so slow
[10:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...this may have been broken for a very long time
[10:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> checking our a revision from April, if it was broken that far back, I'm just gonna leave this alone
[10:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, this has been broken for a while
[10:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> we'll just leave it alone until we get a new site :-)
[10:49:13] <kborchers> doubt too many people link directly to a specific demo anyway
[11:04:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: got a sec for position? is it more enticing if it has to do with flipfit? ;)
[11:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:10:41] <kborchers> check out http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Ca3m5/ and that is my attempt at flipfit. change the second collision to flip to see how they flip first, then change back to flipfit to see where how they are fitted after the flip
[11:11:34] <kborchers> any input on better/more testing or if it's not working the way you envisioned it, please let me know
[11:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> can you add an example where fit alone would work, but flip wouldn't
[11:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> where the element would fully fit within the other element
[11:16:14] <kborchers> yep, just a minute
[11:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> the main use case in my head is: I really want to flip, because that looks the best, but if that doesn't work too well, let's fit
[11:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> which I'm sure is how you coded it
[11:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> but that majority use case for position should/will be elements that actually fit within the within element
[11:18:04] <kborchers> right, when you say "let's fit" is that based on the position before or after the flip ... i went with after so it flips but then does a fit cuz the flip wasn't perfect. am i off there?
[11:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> that should be fine, since it will flip to the optimal side
[11:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> it's not how I originally thought of it, but it's probably how I would've implemented it :-P
[11:20:52] <kborchers> right, ok. building the no flip then fit example now
[11:24:29] <kborchers> ok, updated http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/Ca3m5/ again do the flip to see that it doesn
[11:24:38] <kborchers> 't flip then flipfit to see it fit
[11:24:45] <kborchers> second example
[11:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[11:34:38] <kborchers> cool, thanks! i am going to modify my flipfit visual test to have some more examples and then do a pull request.
[11:36:00] <kborchers> all position unit tests pass as well except the bug 5280 test fails in IE. it looks like a rounding issue. should i not worry about that as i think inukshuk has a PR that addresses that?
[11:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that should be fine
[11:39:27] <kborchers> ok, thanks
[11:40:37] <kborchers> that was a fun one. had to modify a bunch of the tests after i added better collision handling. a lot of flipping/not flipping differences after the changes
[12:04:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, crap! i guess it's not fitting after the flip ... or at least it is but the calculations are based off of the original position. same thing i've been struggling with for a while now. can you take a look at https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/72f5e0c43fab1870e42c432507758ac8a2781464#diff-6 and let me know if you would handle the flipfit differently. doesn't seem to work that way
[12:05:12] <kborchers> tha first replaced each is where to look
[12:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think my brain can handle position code right now :-P
[12:56:08] <kborchers> yeah, i know the feeling ... my brain has been hurting over this one. i'll keep playing with it.
[12:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> could you add flipfit as an actual collision option and just have it delegate out
[12:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> rather than special casing it
[12:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> position seems like it should be so simple to write
[12:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> an
[12:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> and it's actually so painful
[12:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...might release 1.8.16 next week
[12:58:42] <kborchers> i tried it that way first but wasn't getting the delegate out part ... how would you do the flip and fit at that point ... i know you don't want to think it through right now but if i can keep tempting you ... ;)
[13:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> wouldn't you just have something like:
[13:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> $.ui.position.flipfit.left = function() { $.ui.position.flip.left.apply( this, arguments ); $.ui.position.fit.left.apply( this, arguments ); }
[13:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> at least that's what it looks like the current code ends up doing
[13:02:40] <kborchers> ahhhhhh!!! i wasn't bbreaking it out into left and top, just trying to do it with flip and fit. i will try that, thanks!
[13:03:07] <kborchers> makes perfect sense
[13:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> position will do that to you
[13:04:28] <kborchers> i know right? after reworking all of those tests without actually seeing the positioning and just doing the math in my head, i was a little fried when i started on flipfit
[13:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> I had to use a whiteboard the first time I wrote the tests
[13:06:00] <kborchers> i went through a lot of paper
[13:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> once we have everything working, I'd like to try to refactor the code
[13:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> it's always been really hard to follow
[13:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> even just things like simple fitting
[13:06:55] <kborchers> sounds like fun :P
[13:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> at a minimum, we should be able to extract the logic for whether it fits in the within element
[13:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> which is duplicated 4 times, I think
[13:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> maybe even more
[13:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> and probably slightly different each time
[13:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok, finally going to dive into this tabs href matching insanity
[13:10:30] <kborchers> oh wow, that does not sound very fun ... i'll stick with position ;)
[13:23:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: just reworked flipfit and though it's much cleaner, it works the same as what i did. there is still an issue with fitting after a flip, specifically when it's flipping from left to right. time to keep digging. thanks for the clarity on that issue though.
[13:24:17] <kborchers> i should say from right to left ... oh what ever, my head hurts
[13:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:28:05] <gnarf> yeah, position math sucks
[13:31:52] <kborchers> gnarf, no it's fun ... if i keep saying maybe it will come true
[13:32:06] <gnarf> :)
[13:32:45] <gnarf> i'm still noodlin around with that issue for the "scale" effect
[13:32:52] <gnarf> no luck yet
[13:36:53] <kborchers> yeah, effects are fun too
