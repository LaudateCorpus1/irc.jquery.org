[06:54:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7927/files I put getFocusElement() and safelyBlur() into js/helpers.js
[06:54:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... for discussion ...
[06:54:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[06:54:22] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[06:54:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: looking
[07:01:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's not as clean as one would hope, because you can't simply use document and window. You have to pass them in, so the code will work in multi-document, multi-window scenarios.
[07:01:13] <gabriel_schulhof> ... unless you can retrieve the document/window from the element itself.
[07:01:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you can but it involves traversal as far as  i know
[07:02:19] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, that's expensive.
[07:02:55] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: actually https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widget.js#L277
[07:03:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I'll be darned.
[07:03:58] <gabriel_schulhof> So, there's more code that we can copy :)
[07:05:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, wait a sec ... in that code, if the element is the window, then this.document becomes this.window ?
[07:05:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ... unless I'm reading that code wrong.
[07:11:40] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see ... I read it wrong.
[07:12:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats how widgets are able to properly manage cross window / document
[07:13:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, exactly. So, my first guess is I can make the parameters to safelyBlur() optional.
[07:13:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Lessee how the different arities look like and how distinguishable they are.
[07:17:37] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, well, only one other way of calling can be allowed: $.mobile.safelyBlur( x ) (i.e., you either specify all params, or you pass one param - the element).
[07:36:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/3b28c714759a5a146b7b
[09:10:57] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[09:11:59] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[09:12:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[09:12:41] <gabriel_schulhof> In the vein of not losing fixes we've made in mobile, I'd like to make a PR against the UI button branch to check for form= when establishing the radio group.
[09:12:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Otherwise, we have http://jsbin.com/kexoyu/4/
[09:13:36] <gabriel_schulhof> I need some guidance though: a) Is it worthwile? b) If it is, we need to also do the selector escaping in radioGroup()
[09:14:59] <gabriel_schulhof> c) If it's worthwile, do I file an issue first, or can I just make a PR - especially since this is a modification against an as yet unpublished version.
[09:17:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i already added selector escaping i just have not pushed it yet
[09:18:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, sweet! Which branch? button? classes?
[09:19:10] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and sweeter still, we can use it in core, and stop using $.mobile.path.hashToSelector()!
[09:19:15] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean in mobile, not in core.
[09:19:19] <arschmitz> no no 
[09:19:30] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im just using it where needed in the widgets
[09:19:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, that enormous regex?
[09:19:48] <arschmitz> yes
[09:19:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Can we at least put the regex in a common place?
[09:22:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats up to scott_gonzalez but right now im putting it outside the widget and referencing it inside so its only compiled once per widget
[09:22:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's cool.
[09:23:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, so what do you think about the addition? Is it worth it? Against which branch should I make the modification?
[09:23:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i believe scott_gonzalez previously said no
[09:24:11] <arschmitz> and we dont do issues against pr's
[09:25:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK *shrug* 
[09:25:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but ill let him answer for him self on that
[10:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> gabriel_schulhof arschmitz: I'll once again point you to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1761
[10:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> And also: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#the-css.escape%28%29-method
[10:21:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think the question is more about should we support form="some-form" on inputs
[10:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> Did you get an actual bug report about that in Mobile?
[10:22:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not that i have ever seen but gabriel_schulhof^^
[10:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably worth doing something like: $( form.elements ).filter( "..." )
[10:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> It'll even be faster than seraching the DOM and doesn't require as much escaping ;-)
[10:24:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: its more about the opposite i think 
[10:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> Hell, the filter can be a function and then there's no escaping!
[10:25:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: an input outside the form
[10:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about the opposite.
[10:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's outside in the tree, but it's still part of the form.
[10:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's an element of the form.
[10:25:30] <arschmitz> right
[10:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> var form = radio.form;
[10:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> var elements = form.elements;
[10:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> var whatWeCareAbout = elements.filter( isSameName )
[10:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's a lot nicer than doing selectors, actually.
[10:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> We should just do that :-)
[10:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> Unless there is no form.
[10:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> And then we're back to querying the DOM.
[10:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> And escaping selectors.
[10:28:40] <arschmitz> yup
[10:28:55] <arschmitz> because you need to treat the body as the form in that case per the spec if i recall
[10:34:26] <arschmitz> well not body but any other one that also has not parent form
[10:34:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: which is ugly
