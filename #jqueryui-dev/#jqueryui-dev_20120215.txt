[04:03:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Observable: Fix property method in combination with setting array properties. Was missing the oldValues. - Jörn Zaefferer
[04:04:41] <jzaefferer> That last one is based on a case and fix someone send me via email. Took the opportunity to write some basic tests as well, to verify what he was describing.
[04:05:01] <jzaefferer> Observable is a pretty good candidate for thorough unit tests
[05:53:36] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: can you share how the startup/shutdown works? Right now neither scott_gonzalez nor me have any idea.

[06:43:04] <gyzmodo> How can i send a pull request?
[06:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you've never used Git or GitHub?
[06:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved
[06:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> Of course you'll want to fork jquery-ui, not jquery.
[06:45:47] <gyzmodo> I've an account there, but never used :)
[06:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's pretty easy. Just follow the instructions and let us know if you get stuck somewhere.
[06:49:05] <gyzmodo> Okay man!

[08:30:53] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, is there a better way to clear all sessionStorage items with a certain key prefix? https://gist.github.com/016b002ec75f283099b0
[08:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> That's the best.
[08:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> and only
[08:35:09] <scott_gonzalez> Though you could easily merge the two loops
[08:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Just delete inside the first loop.
[08:37:53] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah, originally this was indexed base, but deleting keys while iterating over them is fine
[08:37:55] <jzaefferer> thanks

[09:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_: Can you send me another invite for Basecamp? I'm trying to create a second account.
[09:22:39] <toddmparker_> sure
[09:23:10] <toddmparker_> done scott_gonzalez
[09:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...It sent me a "reset password" link.
[10:22:19] <toddmparker_> wat?
[10:22:36] <toddmparker_> when you click on the link, does it let you in scott_gonzalez
[10:22:51] <toddmparker_> in basecamp, you create your own account
[10:24:42] <scott_gonzalez> It let's me in, but it ties it to the same account.
[10:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> Try sending an invite to scott.gonzalez@gmail.com
[10:45:42] <toddmparker_> try that scott_gonzalez
[10:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> That worked. Thanks.
[10:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> I might be on there twice now.
[10:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> Can you remove sgonzalez@appendto.com to avoid confusion?
[10:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> I apparently only had one Basecamp account before, with a username of scott.gonzalez@gmail.com, but an email address of sgonzalez@appendto.com.
[10:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> Very strange.
[12:00:25] <toddmparker_> ok deleted your apendto account scott_gonzalez
[12:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:00:52] <toddmparker_> just closed 30+ old bugs, flagged at least as many for confirmation to close
[12:01:02] <toddmparker_> man, so much old stuff in the tracker
[12:01:17] <toddmparker_> bugs from alpha and beta
[12:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> Pure CSS accordion is smooth in Firefox, 1px jump in Chrome: http://designmodo.com/demo/accordioncss3/#tab-1
[12:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> At least I assume it's 1px.
[12:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> I love how the author's response to every question is "Use jQuery if you want that." http://designmodo.com/accordion-css3/

[18:26:12] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on node-browserstack by scottgonzalez (57.148s ago): Added client.getLatest() and support for specifying version: 'latest' in createWorker().
[18:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> That should make it easier for browsers we don't track versions of in TestSwarm.
[18:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> For example, just use { browser: "chrome", version: "latest", url: "..." } when calling createWorker()
