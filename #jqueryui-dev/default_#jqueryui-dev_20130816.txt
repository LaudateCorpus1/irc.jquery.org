[05:20:49] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:21:21] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:51:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6148
[05:51:05] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6148 by row1e (1mon 6d ago): Panel feature breaks down and die when scrolling fast in IOS 7
[05:51:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah?
[05:51:33] <uGoMobi> I can easily reproduce on iOS6
[05:51:58] <uGoMobi> scrolling the page or panel closes the panel because it triggers a swipe event
[05:52:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right thats not the issue though
[05:52:24] <arschmitz> they even report they disabled that to see
[05:52:49] <arschmitz> i thought that might be it and commented to that effect
[05:53:17] <arschmitz> but they said that disabling that did not change the only disabling the animation completely fixed it 
[05:53:19] <uGoMobi> right, long thread, I should have read all comments again ;)
[05:53:40] <uGoMobi> we now also have this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347
[05:53:40] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6347 by doomsy (9h 23m ago): Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)
[05:53:50] <uGoMobi> which I can reproduce as well
[05:54:02] <uGoMobi> have to see if there is any relation between the two
[05:54:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not so sure but that is a dup
[05:54:51] <arschmitz> of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6235
[05:54:52] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6235 by jamiepk (2w 3d ago): swipeleft/swiperight seems to lock vertical scrolling on 1.4
[05:55:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah of course
[05:55:35] <arschmitz> 6235 is the real issue but and 6347 is just because panel uses swipe
[05:55:40] <uGoMobi> thanks, will close as duplicate
[05:56:23] <arschmitz> i need to look at #6235 thats high on my priority list
[05:56:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi closed issue #6347: Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)  02http://git.io/uEtLhg
[05:57:11] <uGoMobi> yeah it's a nasty bug
[06:00:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im thinking the change log being ready before 1.4 final should not be a problem
[06:00:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh that would be great
[06:01:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in my day job working with api's like githubs and stuff like this is the #1 thing i do
[06:01:17] <uGoMobi> cool
[06:01:35] <arschmitz> so to parse this out how we want should be pretty easy
[06:02:06] <arschmitz> even if i have to write it from scratch and just make format match ui. since our has to work with github api vs trac
[06:02:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im just going to make it a grunt tack
[06:03:00] <arschmitz> task
[06:03:39] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[06:03:45] <arschmitz> so you can do like grunt changelog --startdate= --enddate= --milestone= type thing to generate a change log for what ever you want
[06:03:50] <arschmitz> and default to current milestone
[06:06:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are we talking about commits or tickets?
[06:06:12] <arschmitz> both
[06:06:17] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:06:18] <arschmitz> ui's uses both
[06:07:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it looks like ui's still gets a bunch of manual cleanup
[06:08:17] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[06:08:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: first they pull commits and pair with issue links
[06:09:10] <arschmitz> then it adds a tsv of tickets marked as fixed
[06:11:36] <uGoMobi> there are so many whitespace, merge, linting, typo commits
[06:11:56] <uGoMobi> have to figure out a way to get only the ones that matter
[06:13:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well to start ill only take ones with a :
[06:13:35] <arschmitz> that sounds filter a lot
[06:13:37] <uGoMobi> yeah that should help already
[06:13:48] <arschmitz> then i can exclude anything containing the words whitespace or lint
[06:14:31] <arschmitz> but really unless these are for things that are already on master we should be rebasing for those and amending the commit in the future
[06:14:54] <uGoMobi> yeah was thinking the same
[06:15:17] <arschmitz> the other thing is not doing tons of commits when its not needed
[06:15:57] <arschmitz> we have places where there are 10 commits in a row on a single file with like changing var x to y
[06:16:18] <arschmitz> should make things like that a single commit of changing vars e
[06:16:56] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:17:09] <arschmitz> just try and have fewer but more meaningful commits
[06:17:43] <arschmitz> espically for things in branches where history can be cleaned up still 
[06:17:45] <uGoMobi> we will have a meeting about "the way we work" when we are done with 1.4 final
[06:18:00] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats a good idea
[06:18:04] <uGoMobi> to discuss these kind of things
[06:18:31] <arschmitz> i think thats a good idea make sure every one is on the same page
[06:18:50] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:19:24] <arschmitz> this is how ui does it already too so another good merge / consistancy thing
[06:26:05] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ping
[06:27:24] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, is there a qunit channel? Do you guys plan to update qunit to become UMD? (currently, it has commonjs wrapper and global)
[07:08:36] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Is the build still broken with that weird jshint error?
[07:08:55] <arschmitz> i had not seen a jshint error let me check
[07:09:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Error: Cannot find module 'jshint/src/cli/cli'
[07:09:32] <arschmitz> oh that one yeah
[07:09:40] <arschmitz> i remember now
[07:09:43] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! Is it ever weird?
[07:10:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: latest is broken i just restarted see if it happens again
[07:10:56] <arschmitz> they all died in ~40 seconds
[07:11:01] <arschmitz> so should know quickly
[07:11:18] <arschmitz> yup busted
[07:11:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I've already restarted it once.
[07:11:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: WTF?! Something wrong with jshint...
[07:11:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it says the module is not found did something in the npm config get changed?
[07:12:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not by me.
[07:12:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It seems an error internal to jshint.
[07:12:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no the task is not found by grunt
[07:12:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like jshint cannot find its constituent bits.
[07:13:02] <arschmitz> i think
[07:13:16] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Not sure.
[07:13:30] <_|Nix|_> I can copy the repo over and do an npm clean/install to see if I can repro locally.
[07:13:58] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#701 (master - d68bb0c : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[07:15:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: last change to npm config was over a weekago
[07:15:24] <arschmitz> and i purged all my modules and reinstalled when the change was made
[07:15:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but we may have directives in there to grab jshint >= min-version
[07:15:32] <arschmitz> and i didnt have any issues
[07:15:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no thats what changed
[07:15:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so we require exact versions?
[07:16:03] <arschmitz> it specifies exact now
[07:16:05] <arschmitz> yes
[07:16:15] <_|Nix|_> I see. Well, then, it should really be stable. WTF?!
[07:16:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/package.json
[07:17:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and another thing. I added the one-module tests for collapsibleset after introducing that deprecated dep on page, and they passed locally, but failed on travis.
[07:17:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really weird.
[07:17:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: usually means a race condition of some sort though there should not be any in that case
[07:19:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, right, and that's exactly why I created jquery.setNameSpace.immediately.js, which does not wrap the namespace setting in a mobileinit listener, since mobileinit will never happen in an init-free build.
[07:19:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I gave that new file to asyncLoad such that it's guaranteed to load after the widget, but before the test suite.
[07:19:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and yet there's that race condition.
[07:20:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was too tired to investigate, so I reverted the whole collapsibleset individual-modules test suite, and then Bam! This jshint error.
[07:20:21] <_|Nix|_> Grrrr!
[07:20:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just a sec ill look real quick see if anything stands out
[07:20:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I reproduced the error locally!
[07:21:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: cp -a jqm jqm-test-npm; cd jqm-test-npm; npm cache clean; rm -rf node_modules; npm install; grunt test
[07:21:55] <arschmitz> weird i did that after the npm change last week
[07:22:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll diff the tree that npm install outputs in jqm-test-npm vs. jqm
[07:23:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait ... how do I get npm to output that tree without doing install?
[07:23:34] <arschmitz> not sure
[07:24:09] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... npm --help is ... no help.
[07:24:13] <_|Nix|_> So many commands.
[07:24:36] <_|Nix|_> list
[07:27:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Versions have changed.
[07:27:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, of course!
[07:27:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: since when? they are hard coded and have not changed since last week?
[07:27:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We may depend on exact package versions, but the packages themselves may or may not.
[07:28:03] <arschmitz> oh good point
[07:28:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So the ground is still shifting under our feet.
[07:28:21] <arschmitz> yup
[07:28:25] <_|Nix|_> :/
[07:28:40] <arschmitz> hmmm
[07:28:51] <arschmitz> so need to look at grunt-contrib-jshint
[07:28:56] <arschmitz> and see what it depends on
[07:29:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ha ha https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint/commit/b0b504b81edac2233e99680621e7b0ce1b13b29b

[07:31:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we need to move up to that version?
[07:32:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah think so
[07:32:56] <arschmitz> because grunt-contrib-jshint uses "jshint": "~2.1.10"
[07:33:04] <arschmitz> so when jshint bumped their version
[07:33:23] <arschmitz> it broke grunt-contrib-jshint 
[07:33:46] <arschmitz> so grunt-contrib-jshint fixed and bumped their version
[07:34:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill take care of it see if it helps

[07:37:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: FIXED!
[07:41:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: WOOOO! massive test failures!!!
[07:41:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Thanks!

[07:42:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[07:42:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, might as well bite the bullet. I'll npm cache clean etc. etc.
[07:42:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm only on jquery git build though
[07:43:00] <arschmitz> so what did they break lol!
[07:43:21] <_|Nix|_> I know, eh?
[07:43:33] <arschmitz> seems like a good time to yell at dave :)
[07:45:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill see if i can see the issue first though :)
[07:47:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Waaay too early to tell, but looks OK so far - locally, I mean.
[07:48:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah this is only one jquery git so wont see locally with normal run
[07:48:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, of course. Understood.
[07:48:39] <arschmitz> all other builds look fine
[07:49:40] <arschmitz> oh and i can reproduce local for sure
[07:49:48] <arschmitz> if i set version to git
[07:49:59] <arschmitz> its like jquery is completely missing
[07:50:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... how can you set the version to git without downloading it and overwriting js/jquery.js?

[07:50:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but where does it grab the version from? http://code.jquery.com/?
[07:51:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I never did take the time to understand how --jqueries is implemented.
[07:51:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: me either im looking now
[07:52:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Some tests pass.
[07:53:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: jquery.tag.inserter
[07:54:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it's using an evil document.write
[07:55:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I see it.
[07:55:50] <arschmitz> well something is massivly broken with jquery git

[07:58:54] <arschmitz> THAT would be to easy
[07:59:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tell me about it.
[07:59:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its all data- attribute stuff
[07:59:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you run the same in Chrome?
[07:59:46] <arschmitz> yes just add ?jquery=version
[08:01:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: found the issue
[08:01:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There are no unhandled exceptions. It's just test failures.
[08:01:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[08:01:19] <arschmitz> its a change in .data
[08:03:03] <arschmitz> hmm maybe
[08:03:33] <arschmitz> it certainly returns differnt things now 
[08:06:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: WOOO!
[08:06:40] <arschmitz> some how with git build you get nested pages!
[08:07:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Say what?!
[08:07:12] <arschmitz> yeah all the content gets wrapped in a page
[08:07:19] <arschmitz> then within that is the normal page!
[08:08:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Probably a change in qunit.
[08:08:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright - I GTG. I'll check in later.
[08:08:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no because all im changing to cause is jquery version not qunit
[08:08:32] <arschmitz> ok later
[08:09:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: SIZZLE!!!
[08:09:16] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/70c9a0a13a56402724590f9450600fabb59e79a8

[08:41:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: gseguin: the failing tests are due to :jqmData() selector no longer working with new version of sizzle it seems 
[08:43:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: gseguin on /tests/unit/button-markup/?jquery=git $("a:jqmData(role='button')") returns zero elements 
[09:04:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: would this be an acceptable solution to give to this guy on github? http://jsbin.com/iretim/3/edit ? (all I did is added a container class to the filedcontain, as he's using 1.3.0)
[09:04:24] <agcolom> if you're ok with it, I'll put that link up
[09:04:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: im looking now give me just a sec
[09:04:42] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[09:04:51] <agcolom> hi Alex and Jasper :-)
[09:05:44] <uGoMobi> is this about that text input width ticket?
[09:05:49] <agcolom> yes
[09:06:23] <uGoMobi> based on the SO post I thought he only wanted an inline text input
[09:06:34] <uGoMobi> but I only had a quick look
[09:07:01] <agcolom> yes, not sure, he added an additional comment with that css so that's what I used
[09:07:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think you need to switch to inline-block
[09:07:25] <agcolom> I have indeed trying to select the wrapper:
[09:07:25] <agcolom> .ui-input-text { width: 70px; display: inline; }
[09:07:26] <agcolom> Has absolutely no effect. Maybe someone could provide a working example?
[09:07:32] <arschmitz> the inputs are cut off otherwise because inline cant have set width
[09:07:53] <uGoMobi> I think that's a selector specificity issue
[09:08:05] <arschmitz> other then that your solution is fine might mention though the real issue is specificity
[09:08:12] <arschmitz> lol yeah like uGoMobi said
[09:09:09] <agcolom> he said: oh, yes, Chrome doesn't get that effect ;-)
[09:09:53] <agcolom> oh, my comments are all messed up! The He said was supposed to go above!
[09:10:40] <agcolom> ok, thanks. by selector specificity issue you mean it's an issue specific to input fileds?

[09:11:30] <arschmitz> actually there is not specificty issue what he posted works
[09:11:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no, the CSS selector used in custom CSS should be more specific than the one we use in the framework CSS
[09:11:49] <arschmitz> well execpt remove display-inline
[09:12:02] <arschmitz> display:inline; cant have explicit width
[09:12:11] <arschmitz> hes making his own rule not work
[09:12:47] <arschmitz> if hes just removes display:inline; it will work as he expects
[09:13:06] <agcolom> right! Ok, oh well, I've sent the message now, he can come back if he's still struggling... but I hate when people say "it really sucks!"
[09:14:38] <agcolom> to all american devs around... when people say that something "really sucks!" how bad is it? (Is it really rude or is it ok?) 
[09:15:09] <agcolom> arschmitz: this one doens't work for me: http://jsbin.com/iretim/4/edit
[09:15:15] <agcolom> (on chrome)
[09:15:37] <arschmitz> what does not work the input is 200px wide? ( im on chrome also )
[09:17:34] <agcolom> yes
[09:17:47] <agcolom> fine of FF
[09:17:51] <agcolom> fine on FF
[09:18:00] <arschmitz> yes its 200px wide  no its not 200px wide?
[09:21:03] <agcolom> on FF it's 200px wide. it's not 200px on Chrome
[09:21:24] <agcolom> it's 200px wide on Safari
[09:21:40] <arschmitz> something is weird there
[09:21:47] <agcolom> I'm on Chrome Version 28.0.1500.71
[09:22:26] <arschmitz> it works fine on my chrome and there is nothing here that should be effected by different browsers and im on 28.0.1500.95
[09:22:34] <arschmitz> so only very slightly different
[09:23:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: does it work for you?
[09:24:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: maybe try clearing your cache just incase? 
[09:25:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/iretim/4/edit?
[09:25:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:25:34] <arschmitz> is the textinput 200px wide?
[09:25:37] <uGoMobi> the first text input isn't 200px there
[09:25:38] <uGoMobi> no
[09:25:44] <uGoMobi> it's 78%
[09:26:00] <uGoMobi> .ui-field-contain div.ui-input-text is more specific than .ui-input-text
[09:26:15] <arschmitz> the one with 178653 in it?
[09:26:16] <uGoMobi> I think we don't see the same arschmitz 
[09:26:28] <uGoMobi> maybe have to click create mileston
[09:26:45] <arschmitz> huh???
[09:26:55] <agcolom> on nope :-( cleared cache, still not 200px wide
[09:27:26] <arschmitz> im truely confused
[09:27:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the only CSS in that JS Bin is .ui-input-text{ width:200px; }
[09:27:31] <agcolom> uGoMobi: but it is 200px wide in FF and Safari with the same url!
[09:27:33] <uGoMobi> so that won't work
[09:27:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is no other width rule specified though
[09:27:53] <arschmitz> at all on that element
[09:28:10] <uGoMobi> there is, for the field container
[09:28:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and its working for me and working for agcolom in FF
[09:28:26] <uGoMobi> or because of the field container I should say
[09:28:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is no width at all on that element in inspector
[09:28:45] <uGoMobi> if that doesn't work, it is a bug in the fieldcontain CSS
[09:29:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats your chrome version?
[09:29:19] <uGoMobi> 28
[09:29:29] <arschmitz> sorry exact
[09:29:53] <uGoMobi> @media (min-width: 28em)
[09:29:53] <uGoMobi> .ui-field-contain input.ui-input-text, .ui-field-contain textarea.ui-input-text, .ui-field-contain .ui-input-search, .ui-field-contain div.ui-input-text {
[09:29:53] <uGoMobi> width: 78%;
[09:29:53] <uGoMobi> display: inline-block;
[09:29:53] <uGoMobi> }
[09:30:02] <arschmitz> ohhhhhh
[09:30:10] <uGoMobi> Versie 28.0.1500.95 m
[09:30:14] <arschmitz> its a media query issue my screen is a different size
[09:30:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:31:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not sure if you caught but tests are 100% busted on jquery git build
[09:32:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, saw that
[09:32:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you talk with Timmy already?
[09:32:31] <arschmitz> iv tracked it further and its actually an event issue
[09:32:36] <arschmitz> im talking to him right now
[09:32:42] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:32:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/jquery.setNameSpace.js
[09:32:58] <arschmitz> no longer works
[09:33:08] <arschmitz> so the namespace is never being set
[09:33:30] <arschmitz> so its not actually sizzle i dont think
[09:34:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: works if you wrap it in a document ready but should not have to 
[09:34:40] <uGoMobi> it's great that we started to test against jquery git build BTW
[09:34:51] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[09:34:58] <arschmitz> catches stuff like this early
[09:35:15] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:35:32] <arschmitz> iv gone through recent commits on core and im stumped 
[09:35:58] <arschmitz> only real change is updating sizzle and not sure how that would cause this 
[09:36:51] <uGoMobi> would be nice if a core commit would also trigger our git build test to run :)
[09:39:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you know that might not be that hard 
[09:39:25] <arschmitz> its just a post commit hook
[09:39:37] <arschmitz> so i dont see why they could not add a hook to core
[09:39:43] <arschmitz> to trigger mobile
[09:40:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can bring it up at dev leads meeting next week maybe?
[09:40:18] <uGoMobi> yeah let's do that
[09:40:33] <uGoMobi> if core people are around ;)
[09:40:38] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah
[09:59:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: gseguin: ok issue fixed by https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/2f985ff826cf55f1fc1fe174716098f758fa5c4d
[09:59:13] <b-ot> arschmitz: Timmy Willison (4m 30s ago): When converting the source to AMD, don't forget to AMD
[10:00:54] <uGoMobi> nice!
[10:02:08] <arschmitz> yeah was a mistake when they implemented amd
[10:03:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see the commit is to 1.x-master branch
[10:03:27] <uGoMobi> not sure how core works with 1.x and 2.x
[10:03:36] <uGoMobi> but shouldn't we have two git build tests?
[10:03:55] <arschmitz> maybe not sure but i know the failing one is 1.x
[10:04:02] <arschmitz> so this will fix it
[10:04:11] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:04:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they have git builds of both
[10:05:30] <arschmitz> so should be easy to add
[10:05:57] <uGoMobi> let's ask gseguin|away to add it
[10:06:18] <arschmitz> sounds good
[10:07:24] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#703 (master - 6b2d34d : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[12:11:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome!
[12:11:53] <arschmitz> just pushed to a branch so i can test easily but 99% its all set
[12:12:09] <arschmitz> it was very aparent what the issue was when i checked the code
[12:12:25] <uGoMobi> yeah, looking at the fix now
[12:12:58] <uGoMobi> nice find
[12:33:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you still need setNameSpace.immediatley? it seems unneeded those tests dont need a namespace at all you should not need that or setNameSpace in those tests.

[14:48:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js and .css now point to 1.3.2. Is that a deliberate choice?
[14:51:14] <uGoMobi> we used this link for a long time in our JS Bin template to load latest code on master
[14:51:45] <uGoMobi> so when looking into old tickets the test pages don't load latest code anymore
[14:59:47] <gseguin> hmm... nope

[15:00:37] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I don't know how the /latest/ or /git/ works on the cdn
[15:00:51] <gseguin> that would be a question for scott_gonzalez or gnarf
[15:01:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks
[15:01:20] <gseguin> uGoMobi: the Jenkins Job is green: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Git/
[15:01:28] <gseguin> so it is copying the files somewhere
[15:01:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thought that you might have discussed that with them when you guys discussed CDN stuff
[15:02:19] <gseguin> wait a minute
[15:03:31] <gseguin> it's supposed to be jquery.mobile-git.js
[15:03:39] <gseguin> there really is something fishy
[15:04:02] <gseguin> uGoMobi: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.js
[15:04:05] <gseguin> that works
[15:04:09] <uGoMobi> yeah, that is the link we use now
[15:04:19] <uGoMobi> so that's all fine
[15:04:38] <uGoMobi> but before we used http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js as our link to latest code
[15:04:38] <gseguin> so the link you sent me before we need to kill that file so it 404s
[15:04:55] <gseguin> yeah that moved to /git/
[15:05:08] <gseguin> though I thought /latest was a symlink to /git
[15:05:16] <gseguin> but apparently not
[15:05:18] <uGoMobi> can we redirect instead of kill it?
[15:05:37] <gseguin> file a ticket in infra
[15:05:37] <uGoMobi> because there are many JS Bins out there with that link in it
[15:06:14] <uGoMobi> of course we can copy paste new links in there
[15:07:14] <gseguin> yeah that's for the infra team 'cause it's not as simple as symlinking /latest -> /git
[15:07:22] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[15:07:26] <uGoMobi> will ask them
[15:08:15] <gseguin> yeah the filename have changed too
