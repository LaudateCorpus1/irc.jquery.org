[13:39:03] <gnarf> nacin: lurking?
[13:39:12] <gnarf> nacin: I'm going to be copying the setup over to the "real" server today
[13:39:23] <nacin> hi gnarf
[13:39:39] <gnarf> nacin: is it still just those two conf files and a mysqldump / import ?
[13:39:53] <gnarf> or are there other things in the filesystem i gotta make sure to copy now too
[13:40:01] <nacin> I need to look at the wp-config.php on jq01
[13:43:25] <gnarf> also - would pulling these things back into puppet put a damper on your workflow?
[13:44:27] <nacin> Not anymore, nope.
[13:44:44] <nacin> All relevant configuration now takes place in web-base-template/config.php
[13:44:55] <gnarf> cool
[13:45:50] <gnarf> building jq01.jquery.com then
[13:46:07] <nacin> I just updated wp-config.php
[13:46:23] <nacin> so you should be good
[13:47:03] <nacin> `ls /var/www/wordpress` should reveal index.php wp-config.php web-base-template/ wordpress/
[13:47:15] <nacin> also gw-resources/, unsure if the creation of that dir would occur via puppet
[13:47:46] <nacin> we should probably create it and set certain permissive permissions on it, but then deny PHP etc.
[13:47:54] <nacin> (deny PHP execution, via nginx)
[13:56:43] <gnarf> right
[13:57:07] <gnarf> thanks
[13:57:13] <gnarf> once I get over this (mt) bullshit
[13:57:16] <gnarf> I'll start on this
[13:57:18] <gnarf> :)
[13:57:31] <gnarf> I just had like the worst experience ever with an admin interface
[13:57:45] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/5f202d10940d8c99d223
[13:58:31] <gnarf> at least their hold music on the phone is cool
[13:58:48] <gnarf> oh - shut up "first in line" lady, let me jam to this bob marley!
[16:30:17] <StayInSkool> hey guys. i'm trying to create a 'fake' scrollbar which basically acts exactly like the regular windows scrollbar, i.e. the container it's in has the position set to fixed, and whenever you drag it it scrolls the entire window. I have it bound to dragstop which scrolls correctly, but when I bind to `drag` it acts very erratically and jumps straight to the bottom of the page.
[16:30:41] <StayInSkool> what could be the cause? is it because there are a lot of `drag` events being fired and i have multiple instances of my handler trying to change the scrolling position?
[16:33:03] <StayInSkool> I've just tried unbinding the handler until scrolling is done and rebinding, and it's still jumpy
[17:12:17] <gnarf> nacin: Warning: fopen(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: No address associated with hostname in /var/www/wordpress/wordpress/wp-includes/class-http.php on line 923 Warning: fopen(http://stage.jquery.com/wp-admin/upgrade.php?step=1): failed to open stream: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: No address associated with hostname in /var/www/wordpress/wordpress/wp-includes/class-http.php on line 923
[17:12:21] <gnarf> should i be worried?
[17:12:44] <nacin> gnarf: short answer: no
[17:13:02] <gnarf> nice short answer
[17:13:04] <gnarf> thanks
[17:13:12] <gnarf> jq01 is up and runnin
[17:13:17] <nacin> longer answer: that warning will be suppressed if WP_DEBUG is off, which it would be if JQUERY_STAGING is false (or if it is set to false)
[17:13:19] <gnarf> 70.32.120.34 jquery.com
[17:13:36] <nacin> gnarf: so, if you have JQUERY_STAGING as "true" in your wp-config for jq01, it should be false
[17:14:31] <gnarf> i assume you meant false and false ?
[17:14:32] <gnarf> define( 'JQUERY_STAGING', false );
[17:14:55] <nacin> yes
[17:15:15] <nacin> but if that is the case then WP_DEBUG should also be false, hiding that PHP warning.
[17:15:16] <gnarf> my login seemd to redirect me to stage.
[17:15:23] <gnarf> or something
[17:15:29] <nacin> yeah, so, I should have warned you, we can't just copy the DB
[17:15:29] <gnarf> i noted that it had been added to my url
[17:15:33] <nacin> it should instead use the install script
[17:15:50] <nacin> if you drop all the DB tables, it'll allow you to run the custom install script
[17:16:03] <gnarf> and that lines everything up with the numbers?
[17:16:19] <nacin> sorry, not sure what you mean, with the numbers?
[17:16:27] <gnarf> the site ids - domain mapping
[17:16:33] <nacin> yes
[17:16:43] <gnarf> in this one case... to keep the users across the sites, can we just tweak whatever DB settings need to be tweaked?
[17:16:51] <nacin> the script actually includes a failsafe to toss a fatal error if something goes wrong
[17:17:28] <nacin> rename the wp_users and wp_usermeta tables, and then when the installation is done, we can drop wp_users and wp_usermeta and move the current ones back
[17:17:36] <gnarf> roger
[17:18:08] <nacin> so, there's a possible second issue (as I said, longer answer) - the server's own /etc/hosts file needs to be configured so it thinks jquery.com is 70.32.120.34
[17:18:22] <nacin> jq01.stage likewise needs the same treatment; I saw this error there too.
[17:19:24] <nacin> that's one possible issue, at least
[17:19:26] <gnarf> makes sense
[17:19:32] <nacin> cause, rather. one possible cause.
[17:19:33] <gnarf> but
[17:19:34] <gnarf> um
[17:19:37] <gnarf> yeah
[17:19:40] <gnarf> that makes sense
[17:19:58] <nacin> well also, some servers are misconfigured to not work regardless. so you can't fire an HTTP request to a URL that loops back to that server - it'll flip out.
[17:20:25] <nacin> and as such, the warnings will continue even in full, launched production
[17:20:28] <nacin> but I doubt that is the case
[17:20:30] <gnarf> seems unlikely in our case
[17:21:28] <nacin> indeed
[17:21:49] <nacin> just wanted to mention it in case someone sees those warnings later
[17:22:20] <gnarf> so um
[17:22:32] <gnarf> is there an easy way to drop wp_*
[17:22:44] <gnarf> my SQL hacking isn't too great :)
[17:22:53] <nacin> do you have any non-WP tables in the DB?
[17:22:56] <nacin> just curious.
[17:23:00] <gnarf> no
[17:23:07] <gnarf> but i want to save these users/usermeta
[17:23:11] <gnarf> right?
[17:23:19] <nacin> yeah.
[17:23:31] <nacin> I have a PHP script lying around I use for this
[17:23:38] <nacin> you can't wildcard drop in mysql
[17:24:04] <nacin> what is SELECT count(*) from wp_blogs?
[17:24:16] <StayInSkool> i've tried setting a boolean flag to ignore all drag events until the handler is done. doesn't seem to work either
[17:24:28] <StayInSkool> sorry. that's in relation for the earlier scrolling question :D
[17:24:42] <nacin> StayInSkool: you're going to want to try #jqueryui, not #jqueryui-dev. This channel is for core development.
[17:24:52] <StayInSkool> oh. strange! i never got it in the search results
[17:24:58] <StayInSkool> apologies fellas!
[17:25:22] <gnarf> stand back - i know bash...
[17:25:24] <gnarf> for table in $( mysql wordpress -e'show tables' -B | grep wp_ ) ; do mysql wordpress -e"drop table $table;" ; done
[17:25:29] <gnarf> StayInSkool: support in #jquery
[17:25:36] <nacin> nice.
[17:25:53] <gnarf> nacin: :)
[17:25:59] <StayInSkool> gnarf: even jquery-ui?
[17:26:04] <gnarf> StayInSkool: yup
[17:26:09] <StayInSkool> ah i see. perfect
[17:26:11] <gnarf> StayInSkool: mobile has its own
[17:26:15] <gnarf> ?channels
[17:26:15] <bot-t> For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev ; Meetings held in#jquery-meeting
[17:26:28] <StayInSkool> let's hope I get heard through the massive wall of "how do I select a class?" questions
[17:26:38] <StayInSkool> i might have to type IN ALL CAPS
[17:26:38] <nacin> my PHP script is a GUI for me to drop individual table prefixes, handle things like dropping an entire multisite network, etc.
[17:28:59] <nacin> gnarf: stepping away for the evening. I can help later on setting up PHP error logging, as well as modifying how WP's internal cron fires.
[17:33:12] <nacin> gnarf: if you run into any issues, leave a note.
[17:33:20] <gnarf> nacin: quick question
[17:33:25] <nacin> sure
[17:33:31] <gnarf> nacin: why don't super admins have all sites by default? :)
[17:33:54] <nacin> it could be unreasonable in a situation where there are hundreds of sites
[17:33:58] <gnarf> i suppose
[17:34:04] <nacin> they still have access to everything; it's just not in the snack menu
[17:34:11] <gnarf> how do i add something to it?
[17:34:18] <gnarf> i forgot
[17:34:24] <gnarf> and ill prolly find it if you walk away
[17:34:25] <gnarf> :)
[17:34:44] <nacin> you can add yourself to a site if you go to some-site.com/wp-admin/user-new.php or jquery.com/wp-admin/network/sites.php
[17:34:57] <nacin> We can make it so all sites get shown for super admins. likely a hook there.
[17:36:40] <gnarf> eh
[17:36:45] <gnarf> i kinda like being able to choose
[17:36:55] <gnarf> now that i think about it
[17:36:59] <nacin> sounds good to me
[17:37:19] <gnarf> is there a link to this network admin somewhere?
[17:37:29] <gnarf> or should i just bookmark and remember?
[17:38:06] <nacin> in the same menu where you found that
[17:38:10] <nacin> My Sites > Network Admin
[17:38:28] <nacin> but it will always be jquery.com/wp-admin/network/
[19:40:37] <rworth> nacin how can we make activation of per-site plugins not manual? Like the static index for some sites. Will that go in something like domains.php? Or part of the install script?
[22:52:05] <gnarf> nacin - we needed a second staging environment
[22:52:19] <gnarf> to test out this "legacy" build that rworth is working on
[22:53:07] <gnarf> I pointed at a different database and ran the install script
[22:53:14] <gnarf> but apparently  things aren't lining up somehow?
[22:53:50] <gnarf> nacin: summary in PM
[22:57:54] <gnarf> I dunno what I did differently on legacy.* than the "live" server
[22:57:59] <gnarf> and live seems okay
[23:59:42] <nacin> gnarf: rworth: I think the old install script had an issue where it duplicated a blog id. You can confirm this by checking the wp_blogs table (seeing this could help me diagnose the issue, either way). Ultimately we can manually tweak the legacy.* DB if we need to rename them to line it up.
