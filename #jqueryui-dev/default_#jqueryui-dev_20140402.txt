[09:32:50] <manus> hello, folks
[09:32:54] <b-ot> manus: You have 2 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[09:33:06] <manus> quick question about dialog
[09:33:11] <manus> `read
[09:33:12] <b-ot> manus: From scott_gonzalez, 2w 4d ago: undefined and not defined should not be treated differently.
[09:33:16] <b-ot> manus: From scott_gonzalez, 2w 4d ago: It's also pretty strange to treat null and undefined differently in a widget.
[09:35:03] <manus> re: dialog: is it normal that one can't by default use the keyboard to scroll overflowed content if it's not tabbable/focusable?
[09:35:06] <manus> example: http://jsbin.com/sizofuse/1/edit?js,output
[09:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> If by normal you mean the way the web works.
[09:36:44] <manus> scott_gonzalez: so it should work the same as any other div with overflowed, non-tabbable/non-focussable content?
[09:37:02] <scott_gonzalez> It should. Does it not?
[09:37:58] <manus> don't think so, but let me double-check
[09:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox will normally let you tab to a scrollable element, but no other browser will.
[09:40:11] <manus> though clicking to a scrollable element should set the focus, no?
[09:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> Did you change that jsbin since you shared it?
[09:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> Because it no longer works.
[09:42:38] <manus> yes
[09:42:42] <manus> it should work again
[09:42:42] <manus> http://jsbin.com/sizofuse/1/edit?js,output
[09:43:02] <manus> (sorry, thought it would make a new version)
[09:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> You should just add a tabindex to the div.
[09:45:34] <manus> I was considering that as a workaround
[09:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we can really do anything about this.
[09:45:59] <manus> do we know the cause?
[09:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's not fully keyboard accessible outside of a dialog either.
[09:46:05] <manus> I think it's the activeElement check
[09:47:15] <manus> the body is the active element, no matter where you click, in this case
[09:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's because browsers do black magic for scrollable elements.
[09:50:13] <manus> understood :] I'm going to test around and see if there's any easy way to fix this issue while not complicating anything or breaking any tests
[09:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[09:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> I wish I had a better answer for you.
[09:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> But scrollable elements just have crazy behavior in browsers.
[09:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> Most people don't even know how to scroll them on iOS.
[09:51:37] <manus> yeah, I saw that bug when researching this one
[09:52:05] <arschmitz> yeah few people know about 2 finger scroll on ios
[09:52:06] <manus> maybe in the meantime I/someone can file the issue to make it known that this is a tricky fix and open for patching
[09:52:26] <manus> (if possible)
[09:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, as something that we don't think we can fix, it'd just get closed as patcheswelcome, so I don't think that's going to help anyone.
[09:53:46] <manus> just to document it
[09:54:01] <manus> would minimize folks like me coming in and asking about it
[09:54:24] <manus> always good to have something to point to
[10:12:37] <manus> at best, it will result in a patch
[10:13:41] <manus> in the meantime, I'll continue my search for an fix that's not annoying

[12:16:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, as I tested it, DB `build-packages` grunt test, as well as jqueryui.com grunt `build-download create-quickdownload` task seems to be working just fine. If you find any problems, please just let me know.

[12:57:59] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, FYI The above simple change will allow jQuery UI's build/release.js to be simplified. I will work on that prob by Fri and will let you know
[12:59:10] <rxaviers> So, for now I only wait you double check if the quick-download (from jqueryui.com) is working as you expect...
