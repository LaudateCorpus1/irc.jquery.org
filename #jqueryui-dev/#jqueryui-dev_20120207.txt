[01:51:32] <_ramo> good morning
[01:52:45] <_ramo> how could i remove the focus from the resultlist when characters are deleted in the autocomplete search field and a new search is invoked?
[01:56:27] <_ramo> the only issue with the provided fix here http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7024 is that, when the mouse focuses an item, on each re-generating of the resultlist the focus is set again. if navigation with the arrow keys, the focus is removed when re-generating the result list

[06:10:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i see in the skype log that you and dan spoke. thought it might be useful for you to see another attempt but looks like it's too big/complex?
[06:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's more clever than useful for us :-P
[06:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> Dan clearly understands the math behind the equations better than I do.
[06:11:58] <kborchers> ok ... yeah i saw it last night and thought it was worth a look, if for no other reason than the math because yes it looked like he had a good grasp on it
[06:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I grabbed his implementation for Expo and saved a few more bytes :-)
[06:12:49] <kborchers> cool
[06:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to come up with a one-liner for bounce, but couldn't figure out a pattern.
[06:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> At one point I thought I could do it with 1/(8^x) and 1/(2^x) for some of the numbers.
[06:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> But I couldn't find a pattern for the numbers that are divided by 2.75
[06:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe Dan's idea of just using an array for those numbers would solve it though.
[06:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> It just seems like having to loop makes the function big again anyway.
[06:15:52] <kborchers> do you have the most up to date code anywhere? repo? gist? i love a good math puzzle. no guarantees but i could look at it for a few minutes
[06:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. I'm keeping https://gist.github.com/e18395f53ceb2e908f2b up to date.
[06:16:53] <scott_gonzalez> We're up to a 54% reduction
[06:17:12] <kborchers> ok, cool. i'll play for a few
[06:39:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: this makes the position math i did look elementary :/
[06:40:04] <kborchers> making my brain melt, and yet ... i can't stop trying to figure it out
[06:40:09] <kborchers> :)
[06:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> I KNOW!
[06:46:53] <kborchers> i do see a pattern with the x - p numbers (the what ever divided by 2.75 numbers) is that what you were looking for? i just can't seem to find a way to one line it
[06:49:42] <kborchers> y = 1 - (x*.54) where x is incremented from 0 so the first if is 1 - (0*.54), second is 1 - (1*.54) ...  the .54 is rounded but it gets the idea across
[06:49:46] <kborchers> does that make any sense?
[06:50:10] <kborchers> so then y would be inserted in the pow like y - p
[15:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I figured out a formula for bounce
[15:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> It adds 4 bytes min+gzip :-(

[17:54:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that's awesome! Too bad it's bigger :(

[19:31:24] <clarkbox> domain is gone?
[19:31:27] <clarkbox> danheberden
[19:34:03] <clarkbox> well domain did not expire...
[19:34:18] <clarkbox> but DNS is fucked
[19:34:27] <clarkbox> at least from where i am at. let me try other NS
[19:35:40] <kborchers> clarkbox: works fine here
[19:36:00] <kborchers> ?down wiki.jqueryui.com
[19:36:04] <bot-t1> kborchers, It's just you. - http://wiki.jqueryui.com is up.
[19:36:43] <clarkbox> ya just me
[19:36:44] <clarkbox> sorry
[19:36:56] <clarkbox> to raise false alarm.
[19:37:14] <clarkbox> my DNS points here 173.203.50.231
