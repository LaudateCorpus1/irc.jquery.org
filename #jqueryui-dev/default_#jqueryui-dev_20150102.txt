[03:43:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like your PR checker Chrome extension isn't working for me anymore. Have you used it recently?
[03:45:01] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: arschmitz: I was having some issues with it recently too
[04:40:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: arthurvr: ill check it out i still use it i noticed a few issues recently on certain pr's too but have not looked into it yet
[04:41:34] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: arthurvr: if you see a PR it does not work on can you send me a link?
[04:42:22] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: arthurvr: i just tried it on several really large ( 70 + commit ) pr's without issue
[04:42:40] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: doesn't seem to be working anywhere for me, the icon doesn't show up at all
[04:43:05] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: Chrome wants to to restart it for an update, but that shouldn't matter, right?
[04:43:05] <arthurvr> for me the icon shows up, but sometimes if i click it nothing happens
[04:43:09] <arschmitz> is it installed and enabled in your chrome extensions?
[04:43:16] <arthurvr> yes it is ;-)
[04:43:24] <arthurvr> It still works sometimes
[04:43:31] <arschmitz> arthurvr: i meant jzaefferer :-)
[04:43:37] <arthurvr> owkkkay
[04:43:49] <arschmitz> arthurvr: but if you find a pr on that it breaks send me the link
[04:44:09] <arschmitz> i found 1 or 2 recently as well but i cant remember what they were
[04:44:26] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/591 currently doesn‚Äôt work for me
[04:44:50] <arschmitz> arthurvr: thanks
[04:45:01] <arthurvr> and restarted chrome, and works again, as always
[04:45:06] <arthurvr> and after a while it stops working
[04:45:11] <arschmitz> arthurvr: odd
[04:45:16] <arthurvr> when I click the icon then it selects the url
[04:45:26] <arthurvr> the extension doesn‚Äôt seem to react then
[04:45:34] <arschmitz> arthurvr: one thing is to make sure your signed into google / gmail
[04:45:46] <arthurvr> yes I am, always
[04:45:50] <arschmitz> arthurvr: odd that issue i have not seen
[04:46:11] <arschmitz> the issue i saw was i found a couple PR's that froze it
[04:46:54] <arschmitz> arthurvr: no the question is is that something in the extension or if its a chrome bug with extensions that show in the URL bar like that 
[04:47:15] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: yes, installed and enabled
[04:47:19] <arschmitz> i dont have ( have never had ) any others that do that even though its a normal thing
[04:47:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: ok
[04:47:59] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I switched the Google account today, to log into some @jquery.com address, maybe that broke it?
[04:48:25] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: I think im going to try and go through and update it this weekend. They have changed a bunch of api stuff in the last year i need to update anyway
[04:48:30] <jzaefferer> though I switched back to my regular address
[04:48:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: shouldnt matter as long as your signed into SOME google account
[04:48:50] <jzaefferer> ok
[04:49:05] <arschmitz> its a public doc but you still need to be signed in to see it for somereason
[04:50:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: your on osx right  and i assume a relatively recent version of chrome?
[04:52:03] <arschmitz> arthurvr: what os do you use?
[04:52:13] <arthurvr> os x
[04:53:27] <arschmitz> arthurvr: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-pr/issues/8
[04:53:47] <arthurvr> Thanks arschmitz!
[04:54:41] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: you said you had a pending osx update right?
[04:54:58] <arschmitz> not osx chrome i mean
[04:55:17] <jzaefferer> Yeah, currently on OSX with Chrome Version 39.0.2171.71 (64-bit)
[04:55:54] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i doubt highly its related but can you just verify its still broken after you update chrome?
[04:58:51] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: arthurvr: i think im actually going to publish it to the google store this weekend so its easier to install and gets auto updates
[04:59:30] <arthurvr> arschmitz: jzaefferer: +1, makes stuff easier
[05:01:47] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: since your here not sure if you noticed but i submitted a whole new pr for classes and closed the old one
[05:02:17] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: yeah, I've got the tab open, will review soon (aka eventually)
[05:02:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: cool just wanted to make sure you saw that i changed it
[05:02:57] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: regarding the extension, where can I install the latest from?
[05:03:06] <jzaefferer> Maybe my copy is just terribly outdated...
[05:03:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the latest is just the git repo 
[05:03:32] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: arschmitz: the github repo https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-pr
[05:03:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: but i have not updated since feb so i doubt it
[05:03:36] <arschmitz> yes
[05:03:44] <jzaefferer> ok
[05:35:47] <arschmitz> arthurvr: jzaefferer: While im working on it any you would like to see added to or changed in jQuery-PR
[05:36:27] <arschmitz> arthurvr: jzaefferer: all ready opened https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-pr/issues/9 because i think that would be useful 
[05:36:42] <arthurvr> yes there is one thing, but let me search the issue
[05:37:19] <arschmitz> arthurvr: yeah seems like you have been using it a lot so anything i can do to make it better for you
[05:37:41] <arthurvr> this thing was weird, still not figured it out https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/511
[05:38:02] <arthurvr> (in the comments)
[05:38:12] <arthurvr> if there are exceptions for people probably it should catch that
[05:38:15] <arschmitz> arthurvr: oh did you read my comment on that already?
[05:38:47] <arschmitz> i commented what the issue was a week or so ago
[05:39:24] <jquicommit> [13globalize] 15stonys opened issue #376: Incorrect decimal rounding by Globalize.format() 02http://git.io/XoZERQ
[05:39:29] <arthurvr> yeah but same thing was with https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/509
[05:39:33] <arthurvr> which was merged
[05:40:20] <arthurvr> I think scott meant it was an exception or so
[05:40:37] <arschmitz> arthurvr: that should not have been merged
[05:41:00] <arschmitz> arthurvr: the cla spreadsheet lists execptions for names with a flag in a column
[05:41:13] <arschmitz> arthurvr: the problem with this person is not their name
[05:41:34] <arschmitz> the problem is that they are using different emails
[05:41:35] <arthurvr> Okay. Good to know. Asking because ‚ÄùYou should see the approval for that in the CLA sheet.‚Äù
[05:41:43] <arschmitz> yes its there
[05:41:48] <arschmitz> but under a different email
[05:41:53] <arthurvr> okay then
[05:42:02] <arschmitz> arthurvr: and emails MUST match 
[05:42:40] <arthurvr> I just couldn‚Äôt really figure it out since I can‚Äôt open the sheet - thanks for the explanation
[05:43:17] <arschmitz> arthurvr: oh you should be able to but yeah would have been clear if you could see the sheet
[05:43:45] <arschmitz> arthurvr: basicly there is a column where you can add comments for name execptions
[05:44:04] <arschmitz> and if ANYTHING is in that column the name check will always pass
[05:44:30] <arthurvr> okay. I‚Äôm not in the team or so, so never saw that sheet ;-) Once again, thanks for the explanation

[12:12:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[12:12:34] <arschmitz> hi
[12:13:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Happy New Year!
[12:13:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Are there any browsers that we support that do not have dynamic base tag support?
[12:14:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7489
[12:14:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont know of the top of my head what ones dont support it so im not sure
[12:15:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We have https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5757 from 2013 where the OP runs into problems with the way we work around missing base tag support.
[12:15:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: At some point I had it on good authority that FF3 was the only one that didn't have dynamic base tag support.
[12:15:51] <arschmitz> which we dont support
[12:16:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, that's why I'm asking whether there are others.
[12:16:20] <gabriel_schulhof> I've tried searching for this info, but I haven't found any obvious lists.
[12:16:27] <arschmitz> i have no idea
[12:17:20] <arschmitz> FF4 was first version to allow relative
[12:18:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Nothing on caniuse.com
[12:18:59] <gabriel_schulhof> It's probably a feature so old there's no more debate as to whether it's supported.
[12:18:59] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1103
[12:19:42] <arschmitz> never mind
[12:19:48] <arschmitz> that was an issue with us not the browser
[12:20:27] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. IE supports it since 7.
[12:22:14] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm pretty sure we're OK with dropping it.
[12:24:19] <arschmitz> i think so
[12:31:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7331 ... we should probably move from $.mobile.dynamicBaseEnabled to $.mobile.base.enabled or $.mobile.base.dynamicBaseEnabled, so the configuration flag is in the same AMD module as the dynamic base update code.
[13:05:04] <arschmitz> yes
[13:18:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. I'll move to the latter.
