[01:25:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[01:25:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, NM. I think I know what the problem is.
[01:27:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I do have a question. I'm trying to do indented and flat sublists with inheritance. So, I have this:
[01:27:57] <_|Nix|_> .ui-listview-flat-sublists .ui-li-static.ui-collapsible > .ui-collapsible-content { padding-left: 0; }
[01:28:01] <_|Nix|_> .ui-listview-indented-sublists .ui-li-static.ui-collapsible > .ui-collapsible-content { padding-left: 1em; }
[01:29:16] <_|Nix|_> So, you add .ui-listview-flat-sublists to a listview and all its children, grandchildren, etc. will be flat.
[01:30:11] <_|Nix|_> So, if you want to turn indentation back on, you add class ui-listview-indented-sublists to one of the children, grandchildren, or whatever. That works fine.
[01:31:02] <_|Nix|_> However, once you'vre turned indentation back on, you can't turn it back off by adding ui-listview-flat-sublists anymore, because it appears earlier in the file.
[01:31:18] <_|Nix|_> So, how can I switch back and forth between indented and non-indented?
[01:35:32] <_|Nix|_> I want this: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/6375633
[01:51:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: To illustrate: http://jsbin.com/irevUNu/1/
[01:51:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess you can't make this back-and-forth work ad infinitum, eh?

[02:05:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[02:09:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[02:09:57] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[02:10:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, there's no way to switch back-and-forth between two inherited properties as you go deeper into the DOM, eh?
[02:11:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking at your example
[02:12:06] <uGoMobi> to see what you try to achieve
[02:12:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I figured I'd ask you since you've been dealing with theme inheritance.
[02:13:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: flat = no padding, indentation = padding-left 1em ?
[02:13:42] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[02:14:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so when I look at this https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/6375633
[02:14:41] <uGoMobi> what LI can't you give the indentation that you want?
[02:15:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think a much simpler example is this: http://jsbin.com/iLIqEG/1/
[02:15:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but basically once you've turned on indentation you can't turn it back off, because the rule to turn it back off is earlier in the file.
[02:16:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the jsbin example it's the same thing but with background colour.
[02:16:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can make that rule more specific
[02:16:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but that will only work for another level.
[02:16:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, for each level where you want to switch back, you have to write a rule.
[02:16:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You cannot express this: Turn all children blue, unless they have a parent that says to turn them red.
[02:17:15] <uGoMobi> that's possible
[02:18:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then can you make http://jsbin.com/iLIqEG/1/edit work so that the squares in the lightblue containers are blue and the squares in the pink containers are red?
[02:18:02] <uGoMobi> .make-all-my-children-blue li { background: blue; }
[02:18:25] <uGoMobi> html .make-my-immediate-child-red > li { background: red; }
[02:18:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but > means only immediate children.
[02:19:05] <uGoMobi> you said parent, not ancestor :)
[02:19:14] <uGoMobi> then leave out the >
[02:19:47] <uGoMobi> it's about the "html" that I added to the second selector
[02:19:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but if you then dive into the red tree and want to start colouring blue again, you need another rule that's more specific still.
[02:19:54] <uGoMobi> could also have been something else
[02:20:40] <uGoMobi> .make-my-immediate-child-red .make-all-my-children-blue li { background: blue; }
[02:20:58] <uGoMobi> two classes is more specific so it will override
[02:21:57] <uGoMobi> ignore the "immediate" in the selector
[02:23:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Look at http://jsbin.com/iLIqEG/1/ now.
[02:23:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I added that rule, and all I got was another level.
[02:24:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It still doesn't go all the way to the center.
[02:24:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the point is that you can't switch back-and-forth with only two rules.
[02:24:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You need as many rules as you have depths where you want to switch colours.
[02:30:19] <uGoMobi> hmm
[02:30:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's like the two rules have to be on the same line in the file. But that's impossible. One has to be before the other :)
[02:46:19] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.6.x core build #394: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/394/
[02:50:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Here's another interesting one: http://jsbin.com/iLIqEG/5/
[02:56:14] <_|Nix|_> OK, I get now why that doesn't work either.
[02:56:32] <uGoMobi> I don't see background colors in that one
[02:56:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. I took them out. The Colours of the squares are important.
[02:57:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. The bottom line is you can't switch back-and-forth between anything that's supposed to be inherited unless you write a rule for each switch you wish to make.
[02:58:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like this: http://jsbin.com/iLIqEG/5/ :)
[03:00:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was hoping I might be able to trick it by using a single class (switch) insetad of two (make-em-red, make-em-blue), but you can't express this: "Make 'em blue after an odd number of ancestors have the class 'switch'" :)
[03:02:08] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess for nested listviews you can either start with indented and turn it off once with a class, or start with flat and turn indentation on once with a class.
[03:06:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you could probably do something with the :not() selector
[03:06:32] <uGoMobi> but no support for that in IE8
[03:07:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I tried things like .make-em-red *:not(.make-em-blue) .i-am-child { background-color: red; } but that didn't help either.
[03:07:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... for the same reason. One of the two rules has to come before the other.
[03:08:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... either because of specificity, or because of location in the file.
[03:10:32] <uGoMobi> ok, I haven't tried to work it out
[03:12:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think it's possible.
[03:12:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, looks like it
[03:17:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: With collapsibles: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/295/

[03:17:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's actually pretty good. You can go pretty deep before it breaks.
[03:20:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, you will have a pretty bad UI before it breaks :)
[03:20:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: :)
[03:21:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so, as far as listview indentation goes, I guess it should be OK, as long as you toggle it only once per outermost listview.
[03:35:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess I should remove all API docs examples that uses swatches d, e, and f, right?
[03:35:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I should change "c" to "a", right?
[03:36:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, we only have A and B
[03:36:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the examples should use theme A
[03:36:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I think I'll do that in a pass.
[03:36:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll finish collapsible and then I'll do that.
[03:37:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: only use theme B in examples that show how to set a theme
[03:37:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome!
[03:37:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[03:38:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess I should change "c" to "a" and "a" to "b", because "b" is the new dark swatch.
[03:46:54] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #368: STILL UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/368/
[03:59:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man! I'm finding so many bugs in collapsible{,Set} as I'm overviewing the API docs for it :)
[04:00:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: like what?
[04:16:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like when I made sure that inset and corners work together correctly (which was a bug) I accidentally left out  this.element.toggleClass( "ui-collapsible-inset", options.inset );
[04:17:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just shows me that I need to test better.
[04:17:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah I see
[04:17:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Tests like these are really fast, because they're synchronous.
[04:18:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So it's worth taking the time to add them.
[04:18:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to update API docs and demos when we add/change a feature, not at the end like now
[04:18:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that's true.
[04:19:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's like when you fix a bug, you add a test.
[04:19:38] <uGoMobi> yeah

[06:03:24] <kborchers> really?!
[06:06:22] <tj_vantoll> Very interesting. The difference doesn't appear to be too drastic though.
[06:06:36] <uGoMobi> interesting and very surprising
[06:08:23] <arschmitz> would be interesting to see for svg vs sprites
[06:08:33] <arschmitz> inline svg vs sprite
[06:15:39] <rxaviers> interesting
[06:22:45] <jlembeck> on the subject of sprites vs. data uris vs. svgs, what he never seems to address is network speed
[06:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't network speed inherintely addressed when talking about 1 additional request?
[06:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> The overhead of 1 more request is likely tiny compared to the data.
[06:25:15] <jlembeck> http://www.mobify.com/blog/base64-does-not-impact-data-uri-performance/
[06:25:23] <jlembeck> His other article
[06:27:12] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: I've been playing around with testing in this regard. If the CSS file size difference is large enough, then it seems to make up for it w/o much of a problem
[06:27:22] <jlembeck> certainly warrants more testing
[06:27:48] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, and the CSS file size is likely to be much larger for data URIs.
[06:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't be surprised if the network cost of dat URIs is higher thant he cost of one additional request.
[06:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, it's going to be one of those terrible typing days.
[06:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> I was up till 2:30a blowing up 400 balloons...
[06:29:16] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: On file size, in the case of PNGs, certainly. In the case of SVGs, probably not?
[06:29:19] <jlembeck> and yeeeeesh
[06:29:21] <jlembeck> birthday party?
[06:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, my wife's 30th.
[06:29:52] <jlembeck> Awesome.
[06:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> Even with SVGs, I wouldn't be surprised if the encoding was still more costly than the extra request.
[06:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> Of course it depends on how many images you have.
[06:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> And how complex they are.
[06:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> But that's just speculation on my part, I don't have any actual numbers.

[08:54:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, still about your "I don't see any changes to the culture files or an import of CLDR files. What's the plan there?" question
[08:54:53] <rxaviers> this is how I see the solution https://github.com/rxaviers/globalize/wiki/Globalize-and-CLDR
[08:55:21] <rxaviers> right now Im coding CLDR (api)
[08:57:30] <rxaviers> A user should be able to `Cldr.load( json data )`. This simple API will take care of figuring out defaults (eg. when user picks `en` locale, figure out calendar = gregorian)
[08:58:30] <rxaviers> And Cldr (json api), will take care of locale inheritances (eg. `en-us` -> `en`, -> `root`)
[08:59:22] <rxaviers> Eventually Cldr will be able to compile a json with inheritances resolved, so user could use a runtime lib (smaller and faster) on the clientside.
[08:59:57] <rxaviers> Im giving this implementation a first shot to see how thing goes.
[09:51:20] <gseguin> uGoMobi: that's not good is it?

[12:00:55] <_|Nix|_> Is it available via npm?
[12:00:57] <uGoMobi> right, but we don't
[12:01:14] <uGoMobi> I mean the TR just includes the same images
[12:01:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah there are tools for that
[12:01:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great, so we can apply the PR and win.
[12:02:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, whenever we modify those binary files, we must always go through all the tools to make sure we get the smallest possible file size.
[12:02:48] <_|Nix|_> ... which is why I was asking whether such tools were within npm's grasp. But I guess these are probably closed source tools.
[12:03:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am not sure if there is one that works best
[12:03:33] <uGoMobi> so I am also not sure if that PR is the best we can do
[12:03:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if it's better than what we have, it's still better than nothing.
[12:04:00] <uGoMobi> true
[12:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> Optimization has to happen after TR generation.
[12:04:20] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Why? Does TR produce gifs/pngs?

[12:14:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suppose we set it like that for a reason
[12:15:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird i commented on that
[12:16:06] <arschmitz> maybe i typed it and never hit the button
[12:16:15] <uGoMobi> aii :(
[12:16:23] <arschmitz> lol iv found open tabs with comments typed but never hit the button
[12:16:36] <uGoMobi> sometimes I have to hit the button twice before it's actually posted
[12:16:45] <arschmitz> anyway we are changing out whole requirejs setup
[12:16:51] <arschmitz> to use the umd approach
[12:17:07] <arschmitz> theres an open issue for it somewhere
[12:17:12] <arschmitz> and core just went amd also
[12:17:32] <uGoMobi> right
[12:19:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/jqueryPlugin.js
[12:19:27] <arschmitz> is what we will be doing
[12:20:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but currently this would break the builder
[12:20:38] <arschmitz> so we need to update that first
[12:21:36] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:22:12] <arschmitz> this is what i had commented there i can do it again and make sure i hit the button this time lol
[12:23:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah would be nice
[12:23:40] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[12:34:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have to add our one rule tabs CSS file before beta
[13:18:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think there is another rule i have to look at from a bug i noticed too
[13:18:21] <arschmitz> but im not sure yet need to look at that one more
