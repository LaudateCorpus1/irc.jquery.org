[05:47:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[05:49:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:49:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think about http://view.jquerymobile.com/7405-more-filterable-selectmenu-demo-fixes/demos/selectmenu-custom-filter/select.custom.filterable.js
[05:49:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We've had it on the feature request list since before 1.0.
[05:50:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D'you think we should add it to the library as a new feature sometime?
[05:50:35] <arschmitz> no
[05:50:43] <arschmitz> we should not add features to select menu
[05:50:52] <arschmitz> unless its just to get us by until ui's
[05:51:03] <arschmitz> and we are already planning on deprecating filterable too
[05:51:19] <arschmitz> frequent is going to take it over
[05:51:57] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... if your third-party-including fork takes off, we'll have a second path towards removing components from the library besides deprecation.
[05:52:11] <arschmitz> it would still be deprecated
[05:52:36] <arschmitz> but this is something you should put in its own repo and point to it from the demos
[05:52:36] <_|Nix|_> Right but after it's removed from the library, it would not disappear into the mysts of time.
[05:53:36] <arschmitz> this should be just like nested lists or datepicker a demo with its own repo i think
[05:53:56] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... what about using your site?
[05:54:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it would still need its own repo though
[05:54:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I could add it to web-ui-fw.
[05:54:31] <arschmitz> i can put it under my name if you want 
[05:54:50] <arschmitz> yeah i just think it needs to be in a repo
[05:54:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool. Can do.
[05:54:59] <arschmitz> so it can have issues and prs etc
[05:55:14] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[05:55:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i got everything working on the sites execpt the post recieve hook to update the builder
[05:55:55] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I saw the discussion you had with gseguin.
[05:56:07] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... this sounds interesting.
[05:57:07] <_|Nix|_> So, how do I go about adding a web-ui-fw widget to uglymongrel.com's version of jQuery Mobile?
[05:57:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have instructions!
[05:57:33] <_|Nix|_> Lay 'em on me, bruh!
[05:57:45] <arschmitz> just a sec let me gist them i need to add a page to uglymongrel.com
[05:59:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/93b0743b7016b41de2b2
[06:01:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "Add project to uglymongrel-jquery-mobile" - what exactly does that mean?
[06:03:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I fork uglymongrel-jquery-mobile, add my stuff to js/, demos/, tests/, and then I create a PR?
[06:06:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ...  or can I add my stuff the way jquery is added, via bower?
[06:06:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: via bower
[06:06:41] <arschmitz> just a sec
[06:06:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thing of it is, we use bower to add the jQM depends on, not for adding things that depend on jQM.
[06:06:47] <arschmitz> ill add line links
[06:07:10] <_|Nix|_> s/the jQM/the things jQM/
[06:07:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does not matter it all works the same
[06:07:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. In that case, I'd rather keep things in the web-ui-fw repo and refer to them via bower.
[06:07:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats the whole point
[06:07:58] <_|Nix|_> I see.
[06:08:46] <arschmitz> people should maintain their own stuff in their own repos
[06:09:00] <arschmitz> this just gives the builder and a single place for api and demos if they want
[06:10:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, ideally, uglymongrel-jquery-mobile will differ from upstream jquery-mobile only in the contents of the bower.json.
[06:10:23] <arschmitz> and a few others
[06:10:31] <arschmitz> package.json
[06:10:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about tests?
[06:10:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess that's up to the individual repos.
[06:10:51] <arschmitz> i dont run peoples tests
[06:10:53] <arschmitz> yup
[06:11:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... that still means that repos need to maintain somekind of infrastructure.
[06:11:43] <arschmitz> not really many small plugins dont have or need it
[06:12:00] <arschmitz> i mean if they want a good one they should have tests but there is no rule they must
[06:12:11] <arschmitz> all im providing is hosting basicly
[06:12:21] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, and build services.
[06:12:38] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:13:21] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... interesting.
[06:13:44] <arschmitz> the big thing is being able to have your plugin included in a custom build
[06:14:21] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. That's definitely important.
[06:17:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do the API docs work?
[06:18:05] <arschmitz> they will use uglymongrel-jquery-mobile full build and you will do it the same as api.jquerymobile.com
[06:18:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, like, uglymongrel-api.jquerymobile.com?
[06:18:45] <arschmitz> nope api.uglymongrel.com
[06:19:03] <arschmitz> because there could potentially be more then JUST jquerymobile on my site
[06:19:13] <arschmitz> that i might use the api for
[06:19:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Will that repo also fold in stuff from multiple places via bower?
[06:19:23] <arschmitz> no
[06:19:32] <arschmitz> you will just add it as a new widget
[06:19:38] <arschmitz> or method or event or whatever
[06:20:01] <_|Nix|_> I ask, because web-ui-fw already has jQM-style API docs.
[06:20:35] <arschmitz> so you could just copy the files and keep in both places if you want
[06:20:47] <arschmitz> or if you wanted to setup something to auto pull them in id be ok with that too
[06:21:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: really what ever works for you im pretty open
[06:22:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The thing with bower is that we'd have to set up the whole updateDependencies bit for api.uglymongrel.com as well, and that'd cause it to diverge from the api.jquerymobile.com build scripts.
[06:23:02] <arschmitz> yup
[06:23:03] <_|Nix|_> Alright. One step at a time.
[06:23:11] <arschmitz> that why i had not been planning on doing it
[06:23:13] <arschmitz> but im open to it

[12:52:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[12:52:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you pinged me earlier today
[12:52:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what's up?
[12:53:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I saw on #jquery-meeting that Hyunsook was asking for next widget to work on
[12:55:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Yeah. The conversation has moved into email.
[12:55:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I just found the email
[12:55:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I was gonna ask about the filterable selectmenu, but I discussed it with arschmitz in the meantime.
[12:55:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you sent it to my old gmail address
[12:55:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Dang!
[12:56:02] <_|Nix|_> Sorry!
[12:56:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ ok, will read back
[12:56:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: np
[12:56:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: checkbox sounds good as next widget
[12:56:45] <uGoMobi> after that maybe collapsible
[12:56:55] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[12:57:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's your preferred email address? The long one at gmail, or the one at your own domain?
[12:57:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about using one PR
[12:58:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's fine but have to be careful with squashing the right commits
[12:59:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: long one at gmail
[12:59:05] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[12:59:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am going to drop uGoMobi completely (including GH username and here on IRC)
[12:59:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see.
[12:59:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think you didn't get the memo ;-)
[13:00:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: posted it in the Google group
[13:00:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I may have gotten it, but I'm really bad at reading email.
[13:00:16] <uGoMobi> no worries
[13:00:23] <_|Nix|_> Oh, Google group? We have a Google group?
[13:00:36] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... so many channels, so little brainwidth.
[13:00:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, the one you posted on as well
[13:01:09] <uGoMobi> jquery-devs-team
[13:01:13] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:01:52] <_|Nix|_> Oh, that one!
[13:02:19] <_|Nix|_> I might've posted to it via email.
[13:04:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it possible to squash a commit in an other commit than the previous one
[13:04:50] <uGoMobi> ?
[13:07:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes. You can rearrange commits however you want, however, you may find that they conflict if applied in the wrong order.
[13:07:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I do that all the time.
[13:08:23] <_|Nix|_> I realize that I made a mistake two commits back, so I make a small commit with a really dumb message like "tmp: tmp", and then I rebase --interactive immediately and squash it into the commit that doesn't look right.
[13:09:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh cool, I have to check that out
[13:10:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can make you a video.
[13:11:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I already have one with editing a bad commit message after there are a few commits on top of it.
[13:11:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that one I know
[13:11:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, this is similar, but you'll be squashing.
[13:12:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe I just have to try it
[13:12:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: until now I only have experience with squashing all or with previous commit
[13:15:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's easy enough if you make an empty repo with a trivial file, like I do in that video.
[13:16:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, actually, it's not that simple, because when you make changes in places that are really close together, it causes merge conflicts.
[13:16:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll try to illustrate that.
[13:16:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool, thanks

[15:30:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can change the order of commits, but you have to remember that, if one commit expects something to be in place which was put in place by a previous commit, then, if the later commit ends up landing before the earlier commit, it will not find that, and will cause a merge conflict.
