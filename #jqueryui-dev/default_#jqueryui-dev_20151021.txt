[07:25:19] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Been thinking about the accessor some more ... If we were worried about performance, we could replace the getter/setter type accessor (get/set) with a data accessor (value/writable) after the setter is called once, giving us the opportunity to install the _getCreateOptions hook.
[07:25:55] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: ... but we shouldn't be worried about performance, I think (http://jsperf.com/property-accessor-setups) ... get/set is only 10% slower than value/writable, and they're all lightning fast.
[09:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I guess that's fine. I don't think we have any dependency on 0.12+, so as long as we're on the latest 0.10.x we should be ok.
[09:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't take too much work to get 4.0 support.
[10:02:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you think it's worth trying to get 0.12 working, or should we just jump back to 0.10 ?
[10:05:28] <gnarf> I'm trying to reinstall eveything on 0.10 now
[10:06:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we should remove simplelog from download tho
[10:10:59] <gnarf> trying deploy all on 0.10 now
[10:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> What doesn't work with 0.12?
[10:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> Just download builder?
[10:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> I thought that was updated, but maybe I'm thinking about when we upgraded it to 0.10.
[10:15:45] <gnarf> jquerymobile's builder is getting this error:
[10:15:46] <gnarf> Running "wordpress-sync" task
[10:15:46] <gnarf> Warning: Unknown XML-RPC tag 'BR' Use --force to continue.
[10:16:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: download builder seemed to work on 0.12 -- it's the version of download inside jqueryui.com that isn't working
[10:16:47] <gnarf> i tried bumping it to the latest (with simple log bump) -- but npm install on a fresh clone doesn't result in a workable grunt deploy on 0.12
[10:16:51] <gnarf> for jqueryui.com
[10:18:13] <gnarf> seems to work fine on 0.10 tho
[10:18:58] <gnarf> okay so the error on the sync on jquerymobile.com is the only outstanding known issue
[10:19:10] <gnarf> I also don't know how to make sure I'm testing the right download servers
[10:19:20] <gnarf> so amd-builder and download builder for UI have not been tested yet
[10:21:31] <gnarf> oh hey
[10:21:31] <gnarf> <b>Warning</b>:  Unknown: POST Content-Length of 10519795 bytes exceeds the limit of 8388608 bytes in <b>Unknown</b> on line <b>0</b><br />
[10:21:55] <gnarf> do i need to increase some flags somewhere for that?
[10:44:04] <gnarf> okay
[10:44:07] <gnarf> that ones working
[10:44:12] <gnarf> all the deployers deploy now
[10:53:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: stage.jqueryui.com/download/ seems to timeout after 90 seconds
[10:53:57] <gnarf> im not seeing anything in the syslogs
[10:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> Is stage.download.jqueryui.com pointing to the right place?
[11:15:25] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #275: 1.9.2 download sets theme scope to "css" 02http://git.io/vWOLv
[11:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> xavier: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/275
[11:25:17] <gnarf> oh - i've been looking for rxaviers this whole time to ping you
[11:25:20] <gnarf> lol
[11:25:55] <gnarf> so - i think the download builder for ui seems okay on the stage
[11:26:13] <gnarf> who knows how to send amd-builder through its tests?
[11:26:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also I think s5fs would kill me if I didn't ask us to write up some testing checklists for this service
[11:28:55] <gnarf> s5fs: scott_gonzalez: arschmitz: interesting command: watch systemctl status download-ui -n 100
[11:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> I actually don't have a checklist, but maybe xavier does.
[11:30:41] <gnarf> it would be cool if there was some automated curl/node thing we could run against it
[11:30:46] <gnarf> but even just a checklist
[11:30:50] <gnarf> is more than we have
[11:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> After the 1.12 release, I plan on doing a full review of download builder.
[11:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> So I could work on a checklist, at a minimum, when I get to that.
[11:31:38] <gnarf> â™¥
[11:37:43] <daradydai> hi guys, I've got fast question
[11:38:11] <daradydai> how jquery ui should be mapped in require js paths config, with or without ui/ folder in path
[11:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> daradydai: Your path should have jquery-ui point to the ui directory.
[11:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/
[11:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> Also, just FYI for the upcoming 1.12 release, we've changed our directory structure.
[11:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> So when you upgrade, you'll need to change your dependency paths, but that'll be clearly documented in the upgrade guide when 1.12 is released.
[11:51:10] <daradydai> scott_gonzalez: thanks a lot!!
[12:34:07] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: missed the meeting, along with Alex. I'm still waiting for reviews of my docs PRs. I made progress on fixing all the DB issues, but there's still a problem with building CSS files.
