[08:08:52] <kborchers> anyone available to work through some of these position unit tests with me. i'm confused as to why the first test that fails is expecting it not to flip but it does and i expect it to flip. maybe it's the improved collision detection but i just want to make sure i'm right before i start changing the tests.
[08:13:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer gnarf ^^^
[08:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> on a call right now, but I can look at it after the call
[08:15:20] <kborchers> cool, thanks. just ping me when available
[09:02:48] <gnarf> kborchers: sup
[09:03:04] <kborchers> hey
[09:03:15] <kborchers> position is melting my brain
[09:03:28] <gnarf> kborchers: is it pushed to your branch somewhere?
[09:04:26] <kborchers> yes, i have found some errors in my math/decision making but i would like the tests to be correct before i try fixing it https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/tree/position_flipfit
[09:04:28] <gnarf> kborchers: my brain got melted by that effects issue yesterday :)
[09:05:17] <kborchers> but you can look at view for the issue that prompted me to ask for help
[09:05:45] <gnarf> i just fetched your repo and checked out the branch
[09:05:47] <gnarf> so...
[09:05:50] <gnarf> unit test?
[09:06:05] <kborchers> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/position/position.html and look at #10
[09:07:26] <kborchers> basically the first one is positioning the elements left top at the window's right bottom
[09:07:47] <kborchers> i don't understand how -10 -10 should be expected there
[09:08:46] <kborchers> that would position it off screen in the other direction
[09:09:56] <gnarf> using window in this test just seems like a bad idea
[09:10:01] <gnarf> but
[09:10:06] <gnarf> i'll move beyond that
[09:10:36] <gnarf> kborchers: does the element have a 10px margin or something?
[09:10:51] <kborchers> nope, height and width are 10px
[09:14:58] <gnarf> okay
[09:15:08] <gnarf> so first of all, what are you expecting out of that test
[09:15:33] <gnarf> cuz as far as i can tell, its using my left top at right bottom of window
[09:15:47] <kborchers> that's right
[09:15:58] <gnarf> collision flip
[09:17:11] <kborchers> when i think flip, i think turning on an axis based on that original position so i would think it would flip to my right top at right bottom see that left/right is ok, then flip to my right bottom at right bottom then all is in bounds positioned in the bottom right corner
[09:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: off my call
[09:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> here's what happens
[09:18:07] <kborchers> cool, jump on in we just got started talking about this
[09:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> my left top at right bottom of window
[09:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> is obviously going to overflow
[09:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> so it flips (in master)
[09:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> which results in my right bottom at left top of window
[09:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> which positions it at -10 -10
[09:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> smart flipping should leave it at window.height/width
[09:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> because they're equally off screen
[09:20:11] <kborchers> hmmmm, ok
[09:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> does that make sense?
[09:20:48] <kborchers> so it shouldn't turn on its axis like i was thinking, it flips based on at instead of my?
[09:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it flips based on both
[09:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> but yes, the axis of the flip is the at
[09:21:48] <kborchers> now i think i'm just confusing myself ... my new code does just that and leaves it at window.height/width
[09:22:05] <kborchers> so the test needs to be updated, right?
[09:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:22:43] <kborchers> ok, i think that helps. i'll see how far i can get updating tests and checking my code and let you know if i confuse myself again ;)
[09:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok :-)
[09:22:55] <kborchers> thanks
[09:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> gonna grab lunch
[09:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[10:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: you around?
[10:09:27] <jzaefferer> kinda
[10:09:33] <jzaefferer> sup?
[10:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> thoughts on using .data() to store previous element attributes?
[10:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> like tabs does
[10:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., header.data( "tabindex.accordion", header.attr( "tabindex" ) )
[10:24:42] <jzaefferer> in general that seems fine, in this particular case, I don't think we care anywhere else about existing tabindex attributes
[10:25:19] <jzaefferer> sorry for the late reply scott_gonzalez
[10:30:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is there any point in cherry-picking the widget demo?
[10:30:52] <jzaefferer> merging manually seems like less waste of time...
[10:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: doesn't matter for the widget demo
[10:32:13] <jzaefferer> k
[10:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> the tabindex is to fix the destroy test failing
[10:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=201&client_id=33
[10:34:29] <jzaefferer> expects −1 but is 0?
[10:34:34] <jzaefferer> or the other way round?
[10:34:52] <jzaefferer> can't we just remove it on destroy? that is, set to whatever value we expect as default?
[10:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> we're already doing .removeAttr( "tabIndex" )
[10:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> doesn't seem to do anything
[10:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> also tried .removeProp( "tabIndex" )
[10:35:52] <jzaefferer> is that an uppercase I?
[10:36:02] <jzaefferer> any difference for lowercase?
[10:36:06] <jzaefferer> *uppercase i
[10:36:33] <jzaefferer> well, it should be tabIndex :/
[10:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, same results either way
[10:45:16] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, what happened here? http://bassistance.de/i/b99584.png
[10:45:19] <jzaefferer> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/widget/default.html
[10:46:04] <scott_gonzalez> umm....a style rule disappeared?
[10:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...it's still there
[10:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> not sure what changed
[10:48:03] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer created widget-demo-1-8 (+1 new commit): http://bit.ly/pCJEvE

[10:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[10:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> stupid 1.6
[10:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> prop bullshit
[10:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> apparently you can't pass className during element construction anymore
[10:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: just change className to "class"

[10:59:06] <jzaefferer> here we go scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/421
[10:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> land it
[11:03:06] <jzaefferer> done
[11:34:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yer pick on the speakers list is cute
[11:34:24] <gnarf> :)
[11:34:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm still curious how you beat the alphabetization ;)
[11:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> hah, not sure how Timmy and I jumped to the top
[14:03:05] <kborchers> anyone know if in position, should a margin cause the element to flip or fit, or should it just be when the element itself has a collision?
