[04:36:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Why is the default value for the pane theme "a"? Why doesn't it inherit from the page?
[04:36:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hi!
[04:36:27] <_|Nix|_> :)
[04:37:01] <_|Nix|_> Oh, NM ... you're flying ...
[04:44:29] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: http://api.jqueryui.com/jquery.widget/#method-_trigger "The option with the name equal to type is invoked as the callback." Shouldn't that be "method" instead of "option"?
[04:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Nope.
[04:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> .autocomplete({ focus: function() { ... } })
[04:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's an option.
[04:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> The value of the option is a function.
[04:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not a method on the widget.
[04:59:06] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15jakubcjusz opened issue #163: 504 Gateway Time-out while download  02http://git.io/iw-pDA
[05:01:11] <tj_vantoll> So in autocomplete if I do this._trigger( "focus", etc );
[05:01:47] <tj_vantoll> What's the difference between .autocomplete({ focus: function() {} }) and $( "mything" ).on( "autocompletefocus", function() {} );
[05:05:33] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I guess I'm confused why the function assigned as an option is designated as a "callback".
[05:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> Because of old underlying APIs.
[05:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> You used to be able to trigger an event and provide a callback.
[05:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Core dropped that signature.
[05:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> But it still exists in the widget factory.
[05:07:54] <tj_vantoll> From a documentation standpoint does it matter to the end user?
[05:08:20] <tj_vantoll> I think the docs would be a lot clearer if _trigger just said that it would invoke all event handlers, assigned as an option or otherwise.
[05:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's not really an event handler when set as an option.
[05:10:49] <tj_vantoll> True, but it'll be invoked as if it was.
[05:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but not at the expected context.
[05:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> For example, many people think that setting the option actually binds an event handler.
[05:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> And then they wrongly assume that it's executed at the same time as any other event handler bound to the element.
[05:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> When in fact it executes after the event has bubbled all the way up.
[05:12:56] <tj_vantoll> I see. Ok I can see why I was confused now.

[05:54:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Good morning
[06:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: So you think we should keep value() the way it is?
[06:39:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm good with that.
[06:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually very likely that the current implementation is based on the HTML spec.
[06:40:21] <tj_vantoll> Yeah. I would expect the current behavior.
[06:42:31] <tj_vantoll> Maybe we could have a valid() method? I don't think we should be encouraging people to change users input on blur, but they might need to know whether the value is valid so they could flag it for the user to fix.
[06:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we could add an isValid() method.
[06:43:42] <tj_vantoll> +1
[08:42:58] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: so I can land the spinner docs PR as-is?
[08:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, looks good to me.

[08:48:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: also, any thoughts on this? https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/172 should I use the dialog example to document it?
[08:48:29] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #172 by jzaefferer (17h 47m ago): Widget: Multiple option arguments can be passed
[08:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's fine.

[09:14:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, yeap I've busy these days. Hopefully by eow and will let you guys know
[09:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yup. I remember when you tried to implement it.
[09:18:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: eow? meow? http://prntscr.com/1poo62
[09:25:55] <rxaviers> lol, no I mean end of the weak :P

[09:26:01] <rxaviers> ops
[09:31:22] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I know, but its funny :-) I also don't really like abbreviations like that. I suspect it takes me much longer to parse them than it would take you to write the three words...
[09:32:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you explain to me (once more, I guess) what jQuery versions UI supports, and when that changes? (maybe we should write that down somewhere, too). Regarding https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/141 which says "When we drop jQuery 1.6 the wording can be cleaned up."

[09:32:19] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:35:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: also, is this still worth implementing? https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/116 were there people that had trouble upgrading in the last six months?
[09:35:30] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #116 by jzaefferer (5mon 1w ago): Add deep links to upgrade guide for API changes
[09:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Maybe just for the versions in which there are major deprecations and removals?
[09:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> But at this point, I'm not sure how many people that will be helping.
[09:43:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[09:45:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what about the UI/Core versions?
[09:47:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[09:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> What UI/Core versions?
[09:48:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that PR from hyunsuk looks good to go
[09:48:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually extend is being used totally improperly in both cases and never should have been there really
[09:49:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so its not even a performance issue the way it is now just does not even make sense
[09:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Might as well just add random bits of code between lines.
[09:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> NaN === NaN
[09:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> 1 + 2
[09:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> "I <3 useless code"

[11:02:36] <tj_vantoll> ? That page is live http://api.jqueryui.com/color-animation/.
[11:03:13] <tj_vantoll> And links to jquery-color's GitHub docs https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color#readme
[11:21:47] <jzaefferer> Looks like we just forgot to delete the branch?
[11:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> Very possible.
[11:34:34] <jzaefferer> aaaand its gone
[11:39:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just rm-rfed node_modules, npm-installed fresh and ran grunt, and I get the same error as travis
[11:39:50] <jzaefferer> let's see who screwed this one up
[11:40:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: unrelated, but nice: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint/commit/95aee7ba76bfe8f04c2b23814d6c98e7e9d5b1b6

[11:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[11:41:20] <jzaefferer> apparently jshint broke this, gonna update to latest grunt-contrib-jshint: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint/commit/b0b504b81edac2233e99680621e7b0ce1b13b29b
[11:41:20] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Kyle Robinson Young (3w 19h ago): Fix cli module location. Fixes GH-92. Bump v0.6.3
[11:42:49] <jzaefferer> master is already on 0.6.3, so maybe just need to merge that update to the datepicker branch?
[11:43:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[11:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-ui/builds/10712410 was in fact the first master build to pass.
[11:44:19] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: have you been rebasing the datepicker branch?
[11:44:38] <jzaefferer> wondering if I should do a rebase or just a merge, like we do on the selectmenu branch
[11:44:52] <tj_vantoll> I believe I was the one to update master to 0.6.3 after hitting the same issue. Didn't think about the branches.
[11:45:00] <tj_vantoll> I haven't been rebasing.
[11:45:12] <jzaefferer> well, but then the new branch is pretty fresh
[11:45:36] <tj_vantoll> Yeah these 3 commits on top are it I believe https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/datepicker
[11:45:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we have a bunch of merge commit on the selectmenu branch that we probably can't get rid of anymore. But we don't really want those anywhere else, right?
[11:45:49] <tj_vantoll> Most of the changes I made are on the dead branch.
[11:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, long lived branches are gonna end up with merge commits. I don't think we're going to get around that.
[11:48:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: yeah i had to update that on mobile a couple weeks ago with jshint
[11:52:00] <jzaefferer> Well, I can rebase as long as its still fresh. I suppose the test will be if rebase works without conflict
[11:52:14] <jzaefferer> Once it starts conflicting, while a regular merge doesn't, we can stop rebasing

[11:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi arschmitz: I have filterable widget and "make widgets work outside pages" as things to mention in the keynote.
[11:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> Anything specific you want me to say about either of them?
[11:57:14] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: hmmm for filterable just that its a new widget
[11:57:20] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: could you help me out with this one? A simple example would be great. https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/issues/50
[11:57:21] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #50 by jzaefferer (35s ago): Document how to use QUnit with AMD
[11:57:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah no problem
[11:58:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: filterable now does a 250ms delay by default, which the old listview filter didn't have. That's a pretty nice improvement from the user perspective
[11:59:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and for widgets outside pages it would just be that this has 2 main advantages 1 it allows people to use just the widgets with out the whole library and page model
[11:59:45] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and second for common navigation elemements like toolbars, panels, popups it allows you to include them only once instead of on every single page to speed up page initalization and rendering
[12:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:00:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: but ill be talking about that in my talk about jquery mobile performance
[12:00:11] <arschmitz> so you probably dont need to much detail
[12:01:18] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/tests/unit/button
[12:01:28] <arschmitz> thats probably a good example for how we are doing it\
[12:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Have all of the widgets been updated to work outside of pages?
[12:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or is it still a work in progress?
[12:13:09] <arschmitz> they all work
[12:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:13:19] <arschmitz> no problem
[12:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> No docs for filterable yet :-/
[12:32:29] <arschmitz> there should be 
[12:34:32] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well i thought _|Nix|_ already did filterable api docs but i guess not but here is the demo page at least http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/filterable/
[12:37:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I haven't gotten around to it yet.
[12:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:37:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats fine i just thought you had
[12:37:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the docs are needed I can get on 'em right now.
[12:38:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think uGoMobi wants everything like that done before beta so people can test
[12:38:29] <arschmitz> so if you get a chance this weekend it would be awesome
[12:39:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess I've been treating the whole business as one big chore, but some parts of the chore are more important than others.
[12:40:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I still need to re-work that whole fixedToolbar + header + footer -> toolbar thing.
[12:40:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking that fixedToolbar.xml as a whole needs to be deprecated with a link to toolbar.
[12:41:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... explaining that the toolbar widget now provides it via an extension.
[12:41:17] <arschmitz> yeah 
[12:41:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Same with dialog.
[12:42:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although TBH the dialog extension is not a true replacement for the dialog widget, because the former has nav special casing whereas the latter does not.
[12:42:17] <_|Nix|_> s/former/latter/
[12:42:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup its not intended to be a direct replacment
[12:42:32] <_|Nix|_> and s/latter/forme/ at the same time :)
[12:42:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but then we cannot truly deprecate the dialog widget.
[12:43:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there will never be a direct replacment
[12:43:20] <arschmitz> its just going away
[12:43:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aaaah, OK.
[12:43:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[12:44:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess it /was/ kind of a kludge. It looks like it's sitting on top of the page, but it's really not.
[12:44:30] <arschmitz> yup and the nav for it was always buggy
[12:45:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's true, and I think part of the problem was that the nav was making special cases based on properties of the active page, like .is( ".ui-dialog" ) and stuff like that.
[12:45:37] <arschmitz> yeah 
[12:46:25] <arschmitz> same thing with popup and its because they ae not truely part of nav they are kinda fudged in 
[12:46:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to separate the decision as to whether something is deep-linkable or not from the implementation of (non-)deep-linkability.
[12:46:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then we can mix and match.
[12:46:45] <arschmitz> so i think these are issues that need to be addressed in nav not in the widgets
[12:46:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, 100%.
[12:47:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway ... I'll get on the filterable and the other widget refactors.
[13:01:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What's the canonical way of linking to jQuery plugins? I wish to link to .val() from one of my widgets. Should I just <a href="http://api.jquery.com/val/">.val()</a>?
[13:03:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I've noticed that the <type> has some special handling where the "name" attribute is prefixed with "http://api.jquery.com/Types#" to produce the link to the type documentation. I'm wondering if there's a similar specially handled construct for in-body links.
[13:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> The val link is correct.
[13:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> There's no special handling for links in random content.

[14:28:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Would it be possible to add signal to the widget factory that gets triggered whenever a widget is (re)defined?
[14:28:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Like, maybe <widgetName>define?
[14:29:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The reason I ask is that having such a signal would be an excellent opportunity for modifying the default values of options for the wiget.
[14:29:53] <_|Nix|_> In mobile, we have mobileinit, but that signal is not emitted if the library is built without an init module.
[14:30:18] <_|Nix|_> ... which is the case if you just want one or more of the widgets.
[14:31:04] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If you wait for <widgetname>create, then the default option values will already have been applied, and setting the option to some other value would cause unnecessary code execution.
[14:33:04] <_|Nix|_> I suppose you could write an extension that simply changes the value of the option ... though that seems like swatting a bug with a sledge hammer.
[14:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I have no idea what you're talking about.
[14:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by "whenever a widget is (re)defined"?
[14:39:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: When you call $.widget, after it sets up the widget, it triggers <widgetname>define
[14:40:11] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Then third parties can go in and modify the prototype.
[14:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> You mean $.widget( "foo.bar", $.foo.bar, { ... } ) ?
[14:40:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah.
[14:40:32] <scott_gonzalez> Why would you ever want to do that?
[14:41:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Well, for example if you are unhappy with the default value for an option as provided by the widget.
[14:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> Then change the value.
[14:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> What does that have to do with extensions?
[14:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> You're the developer. You know when things are loaded (hint: always before any widget is initialized)
[14:42:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still confused about the use case you have in mind.
[14:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> I honestly can't wrap my head around when this would ever matter.
[14:43:13] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. You're right. If you have no autoinit then it really doesn't matter.
[14:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> Even with autoinit it doesn't matter.
[14:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> autoinit has to always be at a later point than what you're talking about right now.
[14:44:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but it's part of the library load process. That's why we have mobileinit.
[14:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter.
[14:44:30] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: mobileinit is when the library has finished loading, but before it has done anything to the DOM.
[14:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> Right, which is a point at which you should have already made whatever changes you want to the default values.
[14:45:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right, and if your custom build does not include the init module you have to run the plugins yourself anyway, so you can modify vallues before you start doing that.
[14:46:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, NM :)
[14:47:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks for helping me achieve some clarity.
[15:16:48] <ryanflorence> anybody know if jQuery ui plans to support AMD anytime soon?
[15:47:35] <_|Nix|_> ryanflorence: It does, AFAIK.
