[05:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[05:34:42] <tj_vantoll> Cool, thanks. Hopefully it'll cut down on the comments on that ticket.
[05:36:11] <scott_gonzalez> Doubtful :-P
[05:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> But hopefully it'll cut down on the number of people who think UI is broken and never bother looking at tickets.
[05:37:18] <tj_vantoll> We can hope at least.
[05:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Why is this a video? Who finds this stuff useful? https://codeproject.tv/video/6938576/video-8-in-learn-jquery-ui-widgets-button-other-theme-elements
[05:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, are you supposed to pay a dollar to see the rest of the video and find out how to download jQuery UI and call .button() ?
[05:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> This is crazy.
[05:54:39] <tj_vantoll> o_O Looks like the site allows anyone to upload and charge for stuff...
[05:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome. Maybe I can charge half her rate and show the same content :-P
[05:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be interesting to see stats on how many people pay for that video series.
[05:56:07] <tj_vantoll> Indeed.
[05:56:44] <tj_vantoll> That business model is getting kind of popular so I always wonder how successful they are.
[05:57:09] <tj_vantoll> I can't imagine who would actually pay a buck for that but the internet is crazy.
[06:13:41] <frequent> uGoMobi: around?
[06:31:13] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:32:28] <frequent> uGoMobi: afternoon & thanks for tabs feedback.
[06:32:42] <frequent> I was playing around with textinput and saw was wondering:
[06:32:47] <uGoMobi> frequent: np
[06:33:22] <frequent> textinput  can be generated with a plain <label></label>, but other elements like checkbox or select require <label for="foo"><select id="foo"></select>
[06:33:44] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:33:53] <frequent> would plain labels also suffice?
[06:34:04] <frequent> so one could skip the id attribute on the element?
[06:35:01] <uGoMobi> frequent: in both cases you can wrap the element in a label
[06:35:12] <uGoMobi> if you don't wrap you should use id/for
[06:35:12] <frequent> cool
[06:35:58] <frequent> nice! Thx.
[06:36:08] <uGoMobi> yw
[06:36:30] <uGoMobi> let me know if it doesn't work, because that would be a bug
[06:36:54] <frequent> ok. I have a big form, so I will try some variations. 
[06:37:07] <uGoMobi> I remember I tested it once with checkboxes, not sure if I ever tried it with selects
[06:37:46] <frequent> ok
[07:30:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|__: Morning
[07:30:42] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[07:49:56] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:50:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: morning
[07:50:18] <gseguin> arschmitz, uGoMobi, _|Nix|__: http://getclank.com/
[07:50:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: i saw your link to that earlier
[07:50:55] <gseguin> wasn't sure you would scroll up that far
[07:51:06] <arschmitz> lol yeah 
[07:51:10] <arschmitz> its very minimal
[07:51:37] <gseguin> it is
[07:52:37] <arschmitz> about 1000 lines of js total
[07:53:33] <arschmitz> and about 2000 lines of css
[07:54:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: did you also notice all about like 75 lines of the js is actually ratchet?
[07:54:38] <gseguin> didn't look at the details
[07:55:04] <arschmitz> yeah id assume about the same for the css 
[07:55:13] <gseguin> just thought it was interesting and some of the approach is very similar to jqm on the markup side
[07:55:34] <arschmitz> yup
[09:14:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its been eerily quite in issue tracker since alpha 2
[09:15:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I think I am the one who opened most tickets ;)
[09:17:37] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #6356: Theme: new default theme and icons tweaks  02http://git.io/o3U0XQ
[10:35:41] <RWhitbeck> I've been working on a project and switched to Alpha 2 and haven't found any issues so far. 
[11:01:05] <rxaviers> gseguin, arschmitz, uGoMobi, _|Nix|__, current Mobile source files are AMD. The goal is to distribute them wrapped via UMD, right (http://goo.gl/8mZvy3). What's the plan? Change the source files to become UMD, or make the build UMD via download builder (keeping the source as it is)?
[11:01:24] <rxaviers> (or something else :P)
[11:12:16] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15frequent opened pull request #6357: Collapsible: fixed typos (06master...06typos)  02http://git.io/cJgBlQ
[11:21:54] <gseguin> rxaviers: wrap everything in a UMD wrapper at build time. We already do that
[11:22:06] <gseguin> check the build/wrap.* files
[11:22:18] <gseguin> we just have these to adjust if needed
[11:23:02] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: that's good news!
[11:24:15] <rxaviers> gseguin, at build = download builder via site?
[11:24:26] <gseguin> both
[11:24:33] <gseguin> release build and download builder
[11:24:40] <rxaviers> ah ok
[11:24:54] <rxaviers> if user `bower install jquery/jquery-mobile`, he will get AMD source only right?
[11:25:43] <gseguin> rxaviers: no idea, do we have to do something to publish to bower ?
[11:25:58] <rxaviers> no, not that it's right or wrong.. Im just checking
[11:26:00] * gseguin is ignorant about bower
[11:27:20] <rxaviers> but, you answered me already ;). it gets fully UMD at build. ;) thks
[11:27:31] <gseguin> you're welcome
[11:27:34] <rxaviers> :D
[11:28:06] <gseguin> yeah so bower does a git clone (it looks like) so the user will have to build it afterward
[11:28:12] <gseguin> using grunt 
[11:28:50] <rxaviers> how do you build with `grunt release`?
[11:29:18] <gseguin> grunt dist:release
[11:49:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do we have any open tickets on surface or windows rt that you know about?
[11:50:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5558
[11:50:53] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5558 by sachinbambal (6mon 2w ago): Windows Surface Tablet sends base url to server when we click on element having href = "#" attribute
[11:51:18] <arschmitz> oh yeah that one
[11:52:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill look into it 
[11:53:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thankfully on surface rt you can still get developer console
[11:55:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: gota love having the right tools
[11:55:33] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:58:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: CLOSED!
[11:58:23] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #5558: Windows Surface Tablet sends base url to server when we click on element having href = "#" attribute  02http://git.io/3GPXNQ
[11:58:26] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:58:42] <arschmitz> there is no request they are just seeing the little url popup
[11:58:53] <arschmitz> just like you get in almost every browser in the bottom corner
[11:59:34] <arschmitz> i clicked over and over and there was never any requests sent ( not to mention changing a hash should never send a request in any browser )
[13:40:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still around?
[13:40:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[13:40:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i made a repo for that datepicker wrapper i wrote a while back and updated to use latest / autoinit
[13:41:16] <arschmitz> there were some new datepicker comments so i figured it was worth giving it a real home
[13:41:23] <uGoMobi> nice
[13:42:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-datepicker-wrapper
[13:42:30] <arschmitz> also this way its an actual file they can use not trying to pull stuff out of a jsbin :)
[13:43:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im lazy though kept my example usage in a jsbin :)
[13:43:35] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:44:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: made even worse by the fact that i have a website thats pretty much a set of demos of widgets and plugins iv written
[13:44:25] <arschmitz> but thats more work lol
[13:45:26] <arschmitz> someone also commented about my swipefix plugin needing to be updated for 1.4 which im not surprised by will have to look into that
[13:45:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: might also be the place to make the changes from that 
[13:45:51] <arschmitz> PR we had to close because of ios4 and opera
[13:46:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv actually had 2 people file issues on that and a few people mention it in jqm issues lol
[13:48:26] <uGoMobi> what PR was that?
[13:48:38] <arschmitz> hold on ill find it 
[13:50:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6144
[13:50:00] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #6144 by pastudan (1mon 1w ago): fixing vmouse start/stop events to use clientX/clientY rather than pageX/pageY
[13:50:15] <uGoMobi> ah right, that one
[13:50:35] <arschmitz> im thinking ill implement that change in the swipefix plugin
[13:51:02] <arschmitz> because frankly i dont care about ios4 and opera mini or whichever one it was 
[13:51:03] <uGoMobi> yeah, think that's a good idea
[13:51:10] <arschmitz> :)
[13:51:45] <uGoMobi> well we have to care about it, but if the fix is not part of the library you can just add comment
[13:51:51] <arschmitz> then we can at least point people there until we do drop support for those and can implement change in the library 
[13:51:59] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:52:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly yeah when speaking on behalf of JQM i care but in my plugin in my repo i dont 
[13:52:46] <uGoMobi> didn't check Opera Mini marketshare for a while but use to be quite big
[13:52:56] <arschmitz> yeah not sure anymore
[13:53:25] <uGoMobi> maybe that's in a market you don't have to care about
[13:53:57] <arschmitz> 9.42% world wide so yeah pretty high
[13:54:18] <arschmitz> thats only among mobile / tablet users though not everything
[13:54:19] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:54:51] <arschmitz> if i recall most of that is in like africa and places like that
[13:55:28] <uGoMobi> yeah, markets with lot of feature phones
[13:55:33] <arschmitz> yup
[13:55:44] <arschmitz> which are not going to support swipe most likely
[13:56:02] <uGoMobi> right :)
[13:58:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh wow the opera family as a whole has now fallen to last place among browsers
[13:58:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: less then 1%
[13:58:37] <uGoMobi> we have to work on improving C-grade experience, add some styles or something
[13:58:59] <arschmitz> yeah i have really mixed feelings about c grade
[13:59:06] <uGoMobi> then I think an Opera Mini user might be more happy with C-grade then A-grade
[13:59:30] <arschmitz> because we lump things in there that i dont really feel should be full no JS
[13:59:52] <uGoMobi> full no JS? what do you mean?
[13:59:59] <arschmitz> like ie7
[14:00:11] <arschmitz> can run basicly any of the js no problem
[14:00:21] <arschmitz> its only our css that gives it any real issue
[14:00:22] <uGoMobi> ah you mean we should have something in between
[14:00:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[14:00:49] <arschmitz> same thing with like old firefox
[14:00:52] <uGoMobi> have been thinking about that too
[14:01:19] <arschmitz> stuff where css3 support is really the only issue
[14:02:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont know something to think about 
[14:02:55] <uGoMobi> maybe we should let go of A, B, C grade system
[14:03:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think its something to talk about in austin maybe
[14:03:24] <arschmitz> with the ui guys
[14:03:38] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:04:08] <uGoMobi> maybe we have to look at browser support for each widget
[14:04:31] <uGoMobi> and better fallback than plain HTML
[14:04:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah or maybe just have almost like a fallback theme
[14:04:52] <arschmitz> simpliefied but similar and functional
[14:05:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, have been thinking about using A swatch for C-grade style
[14:05:57] <arschmitz> I don't know i honestly dont know the best answer but i dont think what we have not is it
[14:06:11] <uGoMobi> or maybe offer it in a separate file for both A and B swatch
[14:07:18] <arschmitz> yeah that would not be bad but then still leave it on the dev to try and determin which to load when
[14:07:20] <uGoMobi> problem with IE7 was the icons
[14:07:33] <uGoMobi> we would have to generate a span
[14:07:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah no before and after
[14:07:46] <uGoMobi> yup
[14:08:32] <uGoMobi> anyway, some stuff to discuss
[14:08:44] <arschmitz> yup
[14:14:49] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15mitchp opened issue #6358: More on <label><input></label>  02http://git.io/A1CnsA
[14:24:39] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6358
[14:24:39] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6358 by mitchp (10m 7s ago): More on <label><input></label>
[14:24:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[14:25:01] <uGoMobi> "I have 100 or more checkboxes/radio buttons on some forms" :/
[14:25:38] <_|Nix|__> uGoMobi: Dang!
[14:25:48] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|__ 
[14:26:01] <uGoMobi> had a nice birthday party yesterday?
[14:26:56] <_|Nix|__> uGoMobi: Yeah, it was awesome, thanks!
[14:27:03] <uGoMobi> great
[14:27:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, like, I don't get it. The markup in that issue is incorrect.
[14:29:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait ... you don't actually need a </input>, eh?
[14:31:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: input is self-closing yeah
[14:31:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but he has that in his markup
[14:34:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I can't repro, but then he didn't provide a test page either ...
[14:35:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I just throw that markup into a page and link in core 1.10.1, it works fine.
[14:37:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, same with 1.10.2
[14:46:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I had a thought: Anyone using .find( "ui-btn-text" ).text( "New Label" ) fails to support C-grade browsers. So, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[14:48:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The reason I mention this is that in our last web-ui-fw meeting the Samsung guys said they were running into difficulties taking advantage of the 1.4.0 performance improvements because they were committed to supporting the old structure. I tried to dissuade them from making such a commitment, telling them that it would tie their hands and encourage bad practices.
[15:00:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's why we have refresh methods (or should have)
[15:01:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and things like <a href="wherever"><span id="somethingByWhichICanGrabThisSpanIfIWantToChangeTheLabel">Old Text</span></a>
[15:01:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This latter works on all grades.
[15:02:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, .find( ".ui-btn-text" ).text( "New Label" ) is not even PE.
[15:02:29] <uGoMobi> true
[15:04:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another thought: Now that we have the enhanced option, we will be formally documenting the internal structure of all our widgets. So, in a sense we can no longer remove a div without a version's worth of deprecation.
[15:05:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... because in our API docs we will be documenting that that div /will/ /be/ /there/.
[15:06:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and people actually using the enhanced option will definitely need a release cycle's worth of time to adapt.
[15:06:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, good point
[15:06:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: should we document it like that?
[15:06:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have to - otherwise how will people know how to take advantage of the enhanced=true option.
[15:06:54] <_|Nix|_> ?
[15:06:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or just say, add markup yourself whatever that markup would be if you would set enhanced to false
[15:07:28] <uGoMobi> code inspector? demo center?
[15:08:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking more like: **NOTE**: We reserve the right to add/remove divs without a deprecation period.
[15:08:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno though ... I kinda wanna give people that time.
[15:08:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: at the other hand, we only added that option in reviewed widget
[15:08:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, we can make the release cycle shorter.
[15:09:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can have a tiny release that does nothing but remove divs.
[15:09:16] <uGoMobi> not sure if we it's very likely we make markup changes in there
[15:09:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I mean a minor version release, but still a tiny one.
[15:09:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure if that's a good idea
[15:09:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I guess we have crunched the markup as hard as we could.
[15:10:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't think we make devs happy when they have to update markup every 2 months
[15:10:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: True, however, we only make those changes if the performance benefits are worth it, right?
[15:11:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IIRC from Hyunsook's analysis we improved by ~30% with data-enhanced="true", right?
[15:11:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I guess this may not be such a big driving factor.
[15:12:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... at least for the widgets she analyzed.
[15:12:35] <uGoMobi> I don't recall the percentage, and it was only a test of two widgets
[15:12:50] <uGoMobi> right
[15:15:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The subject of her email was "The performance difference between enhanced and non-enhanced"
[15:16:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The checkboxradio case doesn't make sense ... 184.24 ms improvement on desktop, but only 10.75 ms improvement on mobile o_O?
[15:16:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah looking at the results now
[15:16:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Those were ms, not % ...
[15:16:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My mistake.
[15:16:52] <uGoMobi> yeah I know very strange
[15:19:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: collapsibleset looks solid.
[15:23:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you look at checkboxradio on pc you see very big differences between each test
[15:24:52] <uGoMobi> maybe she can retest it
[15:25:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I went through all documentation, demo center, web site content and looked into what is where now and where does it belong
[15:26:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will share a document tomorrow
[15:28:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so I guess there really /is/ something in that weird difference.
[15:29:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Strange that checkboxradio bogs down the PC more than it bogs down mobile o_O
[15:29:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll asl.
[15:29:36] <_|Nix|_> I mean ask.
[15:30:39] <uGoMobi> cool thanks
[15:32:32] <_|Nix|_> Bam!
[15:33:47] <_|Nix|_> OK ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6357 is weird! I'm surpised collapsible hasn't well, collapsed O_o
[15:33:48] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Pull request #6357 by frequent (4h 21m ago): Collapsible: fixed typos
[15:40:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, almost makes you think we don't need that code :/
[15:41:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We do. It's for setting options on the fly.
[15:41:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hard to test, too, because it works, it just doesn't remove the old class.
[15:41:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That'll even work correctly when you replace an icon declared earlier with one declared later.
[15:42:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise, though, it will break, because setting an icon declared earlier in the CSS will have no effect.
