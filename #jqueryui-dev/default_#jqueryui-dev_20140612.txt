[00:25:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[00:25:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[00:26:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could you please give https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/305/ the :+1:? I need to link to it from an issue (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6881). I was about to refer the OP to the API docs, but then I realized that I'd want them to see the particular part about copying code and external widgets.
[00:30:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what part about external widgets?
[00:31:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that PR only adds this "If your application includes widgets shared by multiple pages, such as for example a global navigation menu contained in a popup, then you must make sure that each page contains a copy of the popup's markup, so that the first page that is loaded defines the popup and makes it available to subsequent pages loaded into the DOM
[00:31:12] <uGoMobi> via Ajax.", right?
[00:32:02] <uGoMobi> just checking because the PR title is a bit confusing
[00:32:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[00:32:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Ok
[00:32:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: "such as for example"... isn't that the same thing twice?
[00:32:52] <_|Nix|_> I've removed the demo from the PR. It now consists solely of the addition of external widgets to the blurb about needing to replicate.
[00:33:23] <_|Nix|_> Good point. I'll remove it.
[00:33:33] <_|Nix|_> I'll keep "such as"
[00:34:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I'll give it a üëç after that
[00:34:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't forget to squash ;-)

[00:39:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, could you please have another look at it. I've moved the ID to the <p> instead of the <ol> because it shows both if you link via /pagecontainer/#ajax-implications
[00:39:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise, you just see a list, and that's pretty terse.
[00:40:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I'll look
[00:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks, and sorry 'bout the double-:+1:
[00:49:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: This is a bit inconsistent. We don't use IDs in the API docs except for the QuickNav
[00:50:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I don't think we should add an ID to a paragraph in a section just to be able to link to it in a specific ticket

[02:19:26] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15JcDenton86 reopened issue #7481: iOS 8 issues 02http://git.io/V-FqaQ
[04:29:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I didn't add the ID specifically because of the ticket, but because we need to use it often.
[04:29:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not sure if we have a construct that automatically generates IDs, like <h2> or something..
[04:29:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In a document as complex as pagecontainer, we really nede to be able to break things up.
[04:30:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I checked, but we don't add IDs to headings in the docs
[04:30:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know. It's because it's plain HTML. The xsl doesn't really transform the HTML at all.
[04:31:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We add IDs for each example/method/event/option though.
[04:31:41] <uGoMobi> yeah, for the QuickNav
[04:32:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if I would add an ID I would add it to a heading, not to a paragraph
[04:32:17] <_|Nix|_> Right, but it's really awkward to have to say "go to http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/ and look for "implication"
[04:32:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: breaking things up is fine if it makes things more clear
[04:32:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually, that's what I do all the time
[04:33:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I agree it would be nice if the headings have IDs
[04:33:27] <_|Nix|_> Absolutelt!
[04:33:30] <_|Nix|_> y
[04:34:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: any reason why we shouldn't add IDs to headings in the API docs?
[04:36:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we should add IDs as necessary. We should agree on the element which may receive an ID, such as, like, <h2> or <h3> or any heading, but we shouldn't make a task out of adding them to all entries.
[04:36:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This way, the most important and most-often-needed headings will get IDs first, and, eventually, they will all have IDs.
[04:37:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I agree
[04:37:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it will also help us break up the pages by concept.
[04:37:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or do one widget at the time
[04:37:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you add it to one heading on a page, do it for all headings
[04:38:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess, otherwise we'll have a lot of PRs as time goes on.
[04:38:08] <uGoMobi> not subheadings
[04:38:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We have <h2>s and <h3>s in the API docs.
[04:38:37] <_|Nix|_> By "headings", do you mean the <h2>s?
[04:39:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[04:39:14] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... OK.
[04:39:45] <uGoMobi> I mean that not every heading needs to have a heading, but if you add it to a heading of one section, do it for all sections on that page
[04:40:06] <_|Nix|_> Well, shucks ... pagecontainer has exactly one <h2>, and it kinda acts like a title.
[04:40:47] <_|Nix|_> But I can fix that.
[04:42:18] <_|Nix|_> I guess the <h3>s in pagecontainer can be made into <h2>s.

[04:50:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looks good
[04:51:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: It was already there, but why do we use terms like "HTTP-analogous"?
[04:52:29] <_|Nix|_> Because it looks like HTTP, but it's Ajax.
[04:52:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, but half of our users doesn't understand that word
[04:53:07] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I guess it is a bit esoterical.

[04:53:18] <_|Nix|_> :)
[04:53:23] <uGoMobi> esoterical ?!?
[04:53:24] <uGoMobi> lol

[05:51:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:51:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: pong!
[05:51:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:52:04] <_|Nix|_> So, I'm checking with master, and it's the same thing.
[05:52:24] <_|Nix|_> I also don't get why retrieving alertevents.php from my local Web server takes so long.
[05:52:27] <arschmitz> what exactly are you doing to get it?
[05:52:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its pulling the entire api docs xml
[05:52:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Browse to demos/page-events, and click the second button (the one that takes you to alertevents.php)
[05:53:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it works fine for me
[05:53:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, that would explain the slowness.
[05:53:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is it pulling the API docs from localt?
[05:53:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope from live site
[05:53:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I haven't checked my error_log yet.
[05:53:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: otherwise it would need to be updated
[05:54:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should cache after first request
[05:55:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i need to check with ryanneufeld to make sure it will cache on demos site and view
[05:55:47] <_|Nix|_> Ummm ... Name or service not known
[05:55:58] <_|Nix|_> It looks like its failing to look up api.jquerymobile.com
[05:56:12] <arschmitz> that sounds like an issue on your end
[05:56:29] <_|Nix|_> ... which is weird, because I can access it just fine.
[05:56:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe my PHP is restricted from making arbitrary HTTP accesses.
[05:56:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe 
[05:57:06] <arschmitz> i just use mamp and it works fine 
[05:57:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: let me push some changes to the branch and we can try on view
[05:57:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Either way, it might be prudent to not assume that the API XML retrieval will succeed.
[05:59:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and what just throw and error?
[06:01:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, just alert the name of the event without the information from the docs.
[06:01:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the names come from the docs
[06:01:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and all I had to do was restart Apache.
[06:01:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but the name is also present in the event structure. After all, how do you index into the docs?
[06:02:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just alert( event.type ) if no further info is available.
[06:02:04] <arschmitz> pull out all the entries of type event
[06:02:17] <arschmitz> and all the events from widgets
[06:02:24] <arschmitz> its quite easy
[06:03:01] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, all I had to do was restart Apache. That's not reassuring.
[06:03:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that way the tool never needs to be update if we add an event its automatically added to the debugger 
[06:03:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not very reassuring in your Apache instance 
[06:03:49] <_|Nix|_> Nope :/
[06:04:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anyway the whole point is the debugger holds no data
[06:04:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then you can even use it with ui if you want just point it to ui api docs
[06:05:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and its a debugger speed is not my biggest concern
[06:05:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, totally agreed. My only concern is that it totally breaks if it cannot reach the API site, right?
[06:05:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but also why i want to make sure its cached 
[06:06:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes it relies on the api site
[06:06:29] <arschmitz> there is no way around that
[06:06:50] <arschmitz> besides including the entire api xml which i do not think is a good idea 
[06:07:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I totally don't get it. Why can you not fall back to alert( event.type )?
[06:07:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what event would i bind to listen to
[06:07:40] <arschmitz> ??
[06:07:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ooooh ... now I get it.
[06:08:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah there are no event names stored in the debugger to even know to listen for
[06:08:50] <arschmitz> and you dont pass it individual events that would make no sense why wouldnt you just bind your self and alert it 
[06:09:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it sets groups like all events for a specific widget or all touch events or layout events
[06:10:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that way you can find the event your looking for even if you dont know what it is
[06:10:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, that's really awesome! I've often been in a situation where I didn't know to which event to attach.
[06:11:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly many people came to me at confs with that problem
[06:11:12] <arschmitz> not knowing which page event they needed
[06:11:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so with this you just set page:true
[06:11:42] <arschmitz> and you get all of them in order with descriptions warnings and data
[06:12:07] <arschmitz> and the alert option means you can pause execution to see actual page state
[06:12:22] <arschmitz> vs log where you can inspect in more detail after
[06:12:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: alert also good for things lacking a console
[06:13:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i put quite a bit of thought into this from feedback from people at conferences 
[06:14:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv been slowly VERY VERY slowly working on this for over a year lol
[06:14:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it can also act as an event upgrade tool
[06:14:59] <arschmitz> with the deprecated option
[06:24:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking good. I've also been thinking about writing an integration test for the event sequence.
[06:27:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cant hurt
[06:27:28] <arschmitz> since we did mess it up once already apparently 
[06:27:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: even though it seems im the only one who noticed so far lol
[06:31:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... looking at the console output, I'm noticing a few things: Why is it that you get a pageinit before anything else? Are we re-enhancing the source page?
[06:31:42] <_|Nix|_> ... and we need to deprecate pagebeforehide
[06:31:52] <arschmitz> thats in the apidocs pr
[06:32:02] <arschmitz> unless i missed it somehow but i dont think so
[06:32:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I should grunt wordpress-deploy from the PR and point the debugger to local.
[06:32:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah we can also push the pr to stage
[06:32:52] <arschmitz> and point to stage
[06:33:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: let me push some updates to the demo pr first though
[06:33:44] <arschmitz> i added some bad links for showing the error events
[06:33:50] <arschmitz> and added a popup and a select
[06:33:59] <_|Nix|_> OK. Interesting. I switched to the PR, and now I'm no-longer getting pageinit before anything else.
[06:34:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh i probably fixed it 
[06:34:35] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll start working on the event sequence integration test.
[06:34:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there were a bunch of small issues i fixed in that pr i found
[06:35:10] <arschmitz> so pointing to master still finds those issues
[07:35:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When you replaced .trigger() with _triggerWithDeprecated(), you introduced some new pagecontainer events which weren't really meant to come into existence, like the second pagecontainerbeforechange (the one with the jQuery object containing the new page).
[07:35:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IIRC, pagecontainerbeforetransition was supposed to replace that.
[07:35:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[07:35:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I'll test for its presence in the sequence, but I guess we'll never document that, right?
[07:36:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: let me look an see if i can avoid it easily 
[07:36:32] <arschmitz> other wise yeah we jsut wont document
[07:36:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think that's good enough.
[07:37:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, with pagecontainer*, we can simply pick and choose which to document.
[07:37:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[07:37:11] <_|Nix|_> ... in addition to what's already out there.
[07:37:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The array of expected events which I'll pass to deepEqual looks remarkably like your initial spreadsheet :)
[07:37:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should lol
[07:38:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess ui.nextPage is also deprecated, right, in favour of toPage?
[07:38:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah we probably should
[07:38:58] <arschmitz> as it serves no purpose any more
[07:40:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[07:42:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: pagecontainerbeforehide and pagecontainerhide are the only two events of concern, because they inherit the non-undefined nextPage from their deprecated counterpart.
[07:43:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we need to make sure that the documentation for those two events makes no mention of nextPage or, if it did, then we must deprecate that mention.
[08:05:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... I'm not finding pageload in the sequence. It's deprecated, but it shouldn't be removed.
[08:06:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: fixed
[08:06:35] <arschmitz> it was triggering pagepageload
[08:09:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK :)
[08:11:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the first sequence test has just passed.
[08:11:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll push right before the meeting, because I have to go home now.
[08:11:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok
[08:14:44] <antlong_> would anyone be interested in helping me with a bug, free lunch in exchange. 
[08:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> antlong_: Have you reduced it to a bug in jQuery code?
[08:29:12] <antlong_> scott_gonzalez no, just taking a shot in the dark here for help.
[08:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then you want #jquery.
[08:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> This channel is only for development of jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile.
[08:30:03] <antlong_> scott_gonzalez im using jquery ui, i just havent figured out if thats what the bug is in
[08:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> #jquery is where you want to be.
