[11:51:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: any progress on those units for autocomplete?
[11:51:54] <kborchers> wanted to check before i started working on it again
[11:51:55] <scott_gonzalez> nope :-(
[11:52:02] <kborchers> ok, i'll keep looking
[12:00:20] <kborchers> ok, so i can't get it to fail now :(
[12:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> FML
[12:02:52] <kborchers> i don't know what to do
[12:03:01] <kborchers> unless i do something that would obviously break it
[12:03:04] <kborchers> it works
[12:03:22] <kborchers> but i know it was failing earlier with the exact same code
[12:43:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think it got it!!!
[12:43:52] <kborchers> s/it/i
[12:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> what was it?
[12:48:27] <kborchers> https://gist.github.com/1507628 line 71-73
[12:48:40] <kborchers> need a delay because change wasn't always firing
[12:49:39] <kborchers> so then start() wasn't called
[12:49:50] <kborchers> thus no error but it just hangs
[12:50:13] <kborchers> probably explains inconsistency too
[12:50:45] <kborchers> ie6 might just get delayed sometimes with simulate and things go out of order
[12:50:50] <kborchers> that's my guess at least
[12:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> that's crazy
[12:52:07] <kborchers> yep
[12:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> and it doesn't really make sense
[12:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> that's the annoying part
[12:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> I had tried putting a timeout after the focus call
[12:52:35] <kborchers> no it does not
[12:52:39] <kborchers> i tried that as well
[12:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> I split line 66
[12:52:46] <kborchers> me too
[12:52:47] <kborchers> heh
[12:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> that change at least makes sense
[12:52:56] <scott_gonzalez> since focus is async
[12:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> at least in IE
[12:53:11] <kborchers> i started moving start() around and that is how i came up with this
[12:56:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: it actually looks like a 1ms setTimeout is enough to get it working right ... though 50 may be safer
[12:56:31] <kborchers> stupid IE
[12:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> ok, well I'm going to see if I can track down why that delay is needed
[12:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> thanks for figuring it out :-)
[12:58:16] <kborchers> no problem
[12:58:21] <kborchers> and have fun with that :P
