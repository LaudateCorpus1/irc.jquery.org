[17:33:05] <Pashka> hi guys. I am not sure I am competent enough, maybe you can help me. as I saw autocomplete widget when accepting JSON data assume that there are two fields should be there to use it as label and value for dropdown list, so if some API request do not contain such fields there is only one way to handle "non-standard" format - to make AJAX-request manually and handle response items by remap values
[17:36:39] <Pashka> so I thing maybe there is some way to redefine or extend some internal core function of autocomplete widget, some sort of plugin or whatever - probably, it is possible to add some additional parameters and functionality that autocomplete start handle it automatically just usong some config variables?
[17:37:49] <Pashka> i am not familiar how to reach such goal but I guess there some techniks exist how to realize it
[17:38:58] <Pashka> or maybe I just can fork branch and redifine source codes and use only such branch for myself? what is the best practice?
