[19:36:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: around?
[19:39:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: when around, can you verify (or ask for verification of) what i think is a bug. MSPointerMove reports button: -1, buttons: 0 but I would expect button: 0, buttons: 1 since there is a pointer down. could be related to the hover/move issue?
[19:48:16] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: if you're around, same question? ^
[19:49:12] <DaveMethvin> kborchers is this the move that fires before the down?
[19:49:56] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, over fires before down
[19:50:26] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: seems like every move
[19:51:20] <DaveMethvin> but for a finger there is no button? I dunno how they do that
[19:51:39] <DaveMethvin> let me read the spec a bit
[19:51:52] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: the way i read the spec though, touch should be 0/1
[19:52:20] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html#chorded-button-interactions
[19:52:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah, active buttons state is when "For touch, this is when there is physical contact with the digitizer."
[19:53:23] <DaveMethvin> so it does seem button should be set
[19:54:58] <kborchers> that makes me feel less crazy :)
[19:55:01] <kborchers> thanks
[19:55:35] <DaveMethvin> clearly this is an under-tested area :)
[19:56:00] <kborchers> well i'm doing lots of that now :)
