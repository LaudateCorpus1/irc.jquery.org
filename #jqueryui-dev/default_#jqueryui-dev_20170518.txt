[06:11:31] <gimbar> Hey there! I'm trying to use the datepicker in my SPA (navigation by anchor), but when I click on any date my anchor gets reset to "#" forcing my application to "end".
[06:11:45] <gimbar> Already found this bug https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8403
[06:44:10] <gimbar> Is just the log broken or is this entire channel dead? https://irc.jquery.org/%23jqueryui-dev/
[10:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> gimbar: The logs are broken.
[10:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> You're one of two people, literally out of millions, that has had this problem.
[10:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> We cannot reproduce this.
[10:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you can provide a reduced test case, there's nothing we can do.
[10:48:51] <gimbar> one of the two people who cared enough to report. just removed "href='#'" from my local version and everything works fine....way easier than reporting, building a testcase
