[10:16:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Draggable tests: Fixed typo. - Yi, EungJun
[10:31:24] <danheberden> nacin1 were there any security issues in 3.3.1 that would allow someone to possibly empty or modify a template?
[10:31:56] <nacin> there haven't been security issues like that in probably 7 years
[10:34:05] <danheberden> thats... hmmm
[10:34:23] <danheberden> so, like, no weird content injected or anything - just our index.php page in the theme directory was empty
[10:34:36] <danheberden> also the sidebar.php i think
[10:35:01] <nacin> danheberden: did you confirm it was zero bytes?
[10:35:05] <danheberden> ya
[10:35:24] <nacin> was this wp-content/themes/index.php, because I am pretty sure that is a blank page in the repo
[10:35:39] <danheberden> it's actually wp-content/themes/jqueryui/index.php
[10:35:47] <danheberden> jqueryui being the 'theme'
[10:35:52] <nacin> very weird
[10:35:58] <nacin> this on jq01.stage?
[10:36:00] <danheberden> ya, felt weird
[10:36:04] <danheberden> this is on blog.jqueryui.com
[10:36:13] <danheberden> *was, i restored a copy of the original theme
[10:36:17] <danheberden> and upgraded to 3.3.2
[10:36:31] <danheberden> and changed the dir from 0777
[10:36:36] <danheberden> why on earth it was 777 is beyond me

[10:36:53] <nacin> danheberden: if you can drop in my ssh key from jq01.stage, I'll scan the access logs and elsewhere for anomalies
[10:36:56] <danheberden> but the fact that no ads or spam or.. that part boggles the noodle

[12:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Can you ask Maggie or Scott if there's any reason not to add overflow: hidden to tabs to fix http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5601 ?
[12:22:12] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone have node installed on Windows?
[12:27:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: Win-whatnow?
[12:27:11] <kborchers> :P
[12:36:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I have
[12:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a zip program that you can run from the command line?
[12:41:52] <jzaefferer> nope
[12:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> Can you install one?
[12:42:08] <jzaefferer> maybe
[12:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to know if you can successfully run a build right now.
[12:42:13] <jzaefferer> watcha looking for?
[12:42:18] <jzaefferer> ah
[12:42:37] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously we still want to get to the point where the zips are handled purely in node.
[12:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> But it seems like it might be possible to run a build on Windows right now.
[12:43:43] <jzaefferer> well, the program would have to be named zip and be in the PATH, which isn't the case by default
[12:43:49] <jzaefferer> let's see if I can get that set up...
[12:48:41] <jzaefferer> waiting for npm to install dependencies...
[12:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy: http://timkadlec.com/2012/05/wtfwg/
[12:53:17] <danheberden> yay for srcset!
[12:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> "That same day it was recommended to the list that they take a look at all the discussion that had taken place in the community group." <-- that was me :-)
[12:53:40] <jzaefferer> Really annoying that you have to run grunt as `grunt.cmd`
[12:53:53] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:53:59] <jzaefferer> otherwise it gets executed via JScript host crap
[12:54:14] <jzaefferer> but that's about it
[12:54:16] <jzaefferer> works fine
[12:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like we can close this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8085
[12:54:37] <danheberden> i opened terminal, but cmd.exe isn't working
[12:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's workable.
[12:55:12] <jzaefferer> just put zip.exe from http://stahlworks.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip on your path, install node.msi (includes npm), done
[12:55:30] <jzaefferer> we may want to document the whole gruntiness though
[12:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though that's a separate issue.
[12:55:56] <jzaefferer> yep
[12:56:00] <jzaefferer> it always is :p
[12:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> Closed the issue.
[12:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll start documenting grunt in the readme.
[12:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can we close this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5885
[12:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29 is looking better every week :-)
[12:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> Look at all that bright green!
[13:04:09] <jzaefferer> I'm fine with closing #5885, though once core lands support, we should revisit the issue, talk to Chad about it
[13:05:26] <jzaefferer> One of the autocomplete tickets is close to getting fixed :-)
[13:05:34] <jzaefferer> the only blocker
[13:05:46] <jzaefferer> Just waiting to hear back from Everett now
[13:06:14] <jzaefferer> Though even without his feedback, its a lot better now then before
[13:06:33] <jzaefferer> aria-autocomplete=list just doesn't do anything useful as this point

[13:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> nice :-)
