[00:31:31] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #24: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/24/
[00:31:32] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Menu tests: Removed test for key handling when the element doens't have focus (illogical test).
[00:31:32] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Slider tests: Minor cleanup: added expect() calls, fixed left-over slider that was appended to body.
[00:31:33] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Slider tests: Fixed style checks for orientation test.
[00:31:33] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Datepicker: Modified _updateDatepicker to not update display if updated instance is not current instance. Fixed #6814 - datepicker('setDate') incorrectly overwrites current display with two datepickers.
[00:31:34] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Datepicker: Deleted z-index style on hidden input. Fixed #7449 - Datepicker dialog has a negative z-index.
[00:31:34] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Datepicker: Fixed position problem when input is in a fixed element. Fixes #5626 - DatePicker doesn't work inside fixed div.
[00:31:35] <i-hate-dave> * Scott González: Update project description.
[07:05:02] <rworth> scott_gonzalez latest web-base-template has richa's plugin details PR merged
[07:05:25] <rworth> I'll have designers work on incorporating gravatars into comp
[07:06:43] <rworth> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/foo/ :)
[07:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Looks good :-)
[07:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> What's up with the related plugins section?
[07:21:34] <rworth> it was just stubbed
[07:21:49] <rworth> I guess we yank it
[07:22:31] <rworth> unless we can figure out an easy way to list top plugins with in-common tags
[07:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> Not for the initial release.
[07:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> Just drop it.
[07:23:31] <rworth> ok
[07:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> There will be no "top plugins" logic on release.
[07:23:59] <ajpiano> wahey, looks great!!
[07:24:12] <ajpiano> also pygments is almost dead guys
[07:24:16] <ajpiano> i think ;)
[07:25:08] <rworth> yanked
[07:25:16] <rworth> so awesome ajpiano
[08:04:03] <jzaefferer> rworth: getting 404 for tags: http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/tag/bar/
[08:05:05] <rworth> scott_gonzalez any ideas?
[08:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably seaching posts, not jquery_plugins.
[09:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone have anything in grunt-wordpress that they need added/changed?
[09:33:00] <rworth> where are we at with users
[09:33:26] <rworth> scott_gonzalez have you had a chance to test https://github.com/beaucollins/node-wordpress-user-sync ?
[09:33:43] <rworth> oh, that's node-wordpress, not grunt-wordpress, huh
[09:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: That's grunt-wordpress.
[09:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> I guess you didn't see my email from 2 weeks ago?
[09:34:25] <rworth> oh it is
[09:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the problem is that it's not actually grunt-wordpress.
[09:34:49] <rworth> I saw your email where you asked him to do a new thing and I saw this is his new repo (your email links to the old one)
[09:35:23] <rworth> haven't looked beyond that. Has it not actually been reworked?
[09:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I didn't know he changed the repo name.
[09:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> No, it hasn't been changed.
[09:35:43] <rworth> ok
[09:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> That won't live inside grunt-wordpress anyway though.
[09:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be an extension.
[09:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard a word from anyone about this since I sent my email two weeks ago.
[10:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf danheberden: Can we go into the trac DB and change the 1.9 version to 1.9.0?
[10:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, 1.9 milestone.
[10:19:39] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: 1.8 is still 1.8
[10:19:42] <danheberden> do you want that changed too?
[10:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> No, that one is fine.
[10:20:11] <danheberden> k updated
[10:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> I just need 1.9.0 to match the version that we're going to tag with so that the new release script will search for the correct things.
[10:20:58] <danheberden> do you want tickets updated too?
[10:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: yeah
[10:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> The tickets are what I was concerned with.
[10:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't want to generate 2000 emails...
[10:22:58] <danheberden> ha
[10:23:28] <danheberden> i haven't written a sequel statement in like a year
[10:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> It literally would've sent 1,831 emails to everyone :-/
[10:23:33] <danheberden> this is hillarious
[10:23:37] <danheberden> that's nuts
[10:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, people would not be happy.
[10:23:51] <danheberden> HAPPY EMAIL BOMB DAY!
[10:24:54] <danheberden> 1831 tickets now 1.9.0
[10:25:09] <danheberden> that took 384ms? that poor box
[10:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> Now time to test the release script :-)
[10:25:47] <danheberden> hawtness
[10:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[10:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> This upgrade guide and changelog are going to suck to write.
[10:38:05] <gnarf> hey
[10:38:07] <gnarf> sorry i missed meeting
[10:38:11] <gnarf> Trying to track down the irc logs now
[10:40:24] <gnarf> Krinkle: re jq03 you should have sudo
[10:40:27] <gnarf> whats the error?
[10:40:42] <gnarf> if its asking for a password, you set it
[10:40:50] <gnarf> unless you didn't change it
[10:40:58] <gnarf> in which case I'll pm you your password
[10:43:30] <Krinkle> gnarf: I didn't set a password. Do I have LDAP or something?
[10:43:35] <Krinkle> it is indeed asking for a password
[10:43:49] <Krinkle> thx, got it
[10:43:54] <gnarf> Krinkle: please change your password
[10:44:06] <Krinkle> I will

[16:29:18] <nacin> gnarf: hello
[16:29:31] <gnarf> nacin - 1 sec, typing out explaination in issue
[16:30:28] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/55
[16:30:29] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[16:30:43] <gnarf> your keys should exist on that machine too
[16:30:49] <gnarf> but
[16:30:52] <gnarf> i have one thing to check
[16:32:20] <gnarf> think i might have it
[16:32:26] <gnarf> xsl wasn't enabled
[17:03:59] <gnarf> hrm
[17:04:05] <gnarf> okay this problem is css related
[17:04:07] <gnarf> and wacky
[17:41:51] <gnarf> nacin: that was one of those moments when by the act of explaining the issue you have like 3 ideas of how it could be fixed that completely escaped you 2 minutes before :)
