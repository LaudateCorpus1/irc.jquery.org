[04:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think what we want to test is that an actual animation doesn't break other functionality
[04:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> we already know that immediate show/hide works from the non-animation tests
[04:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> and we know that the _show/_hide methods on $.Widget work, because they're tested
[04:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> for individual widgets what we want to know is that the animation occurs and the end result is what we expect
[04:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> so for tooltip that could be checking the position after the animation
[04:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> for dialog, it could be checking the position and that the correct element has focus
[05:32:47] <jzaefferer> hey kflorence, are you around? wondering if you're going to do more on globalize, your help is certainly very welcome

[09:15:32] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tests: Created a composite test suite. - Scott González
[09:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> WHOO!!!
[09:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> you can now run the full test suite from a single page
[10:16:21] <jzaefferer> except that its not yet on http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all.html
[10:16:31] <jzaefferer> slow or broken cronjob danheberden?
[10:16:48] <danheberden> jzaefferer huh?
[10:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> I just added a new file and it's not showing up on view.
[10:17:13] <danheberden> i think it's every 5-10 minutes right now?
[10:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> it's been an hour since the commit
[10:17:17] <danheberden> hmm
[10:17:26] <danheberden> clarkbox is gone for a few more days
[10:17:31] <danheberden> lemme hop in and see if he made it easy to pull
[10:17:55] <danheberden> the mt boxes are awful at crons
[10:17:57] <danheberden> so he probably set it up
[10:18:03] <danheberden> and its not running
[10:19:38] <jzaefferer> surprise surprise, a broken cronjob
[10:21:25] <danheberden> hmm, so the script is python
[10:21:27] <danheberden> i don't know python
[10:21:33] <danheberden> and it's having errors
[10:24:06] <scott_gonzalez> well, who knows python?
[10:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh, let's just tweet "@diveintomark come fix our broken shit" and see if that works :-P
[10:24:57] <danheberden> well, i think i see how it's supposed to work
[10:25:02] <danheberden> but, not sure where he put everything
[10:25:05] <danheberden> hmm
[10:25:11] <danheberden> ( still looking)
[10:28:49] <danheberden> jzaefferer how about now
[10:29:00] <danheberden> is it that one url?
[10:30:09] <danheberden> weird, it copied but didn't pull
[10:33:02] <danheberden> there you to jzaefferer
[10:33:07] <danheberden> it was only pulling on the last branch
[10:33:09] <danheberden> not each branch
[10:34:29] <jzaefferer> teh works: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all.html
[10:34:37] <jzaefferer> enable Hide passed tests, then reload once its done
[10:34:44] <jzaefferer> reruns the broken suites first :-)

[11:38:40] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu tests: Removed console.log() call. - Scott González
[11:39:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, sorry i think that console.log() call was me when I was adding and testing those new tests.
[11:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh, no problem
[11:40:22] <scott_gonzalez> noticed it from the composite test suite :-)
[11:40:35] <kborchers> that is really cool btw!
[11:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> that previous commit was me fixing a place where I put expect() outside of a test() :-/
[11:40:54] <kborchers> oops
[11:48:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: then i'm not really sure what to expect out of those animations, I assumed we were just looking to make sure that the animations were called, executed properly
