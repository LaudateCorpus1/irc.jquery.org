[05:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Will WordPress redirect to force HTTP_HOST to be consistent?
[06:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> www.foo.com vs. foo.com
[06:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> get_option('siteurl') seems potentially better
[06:00:50] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: same thing. you'd just need to chop off the protocol in that case
[06:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> Though I assume that could have directories, though we could parse it.
[06:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if siteurl isn't going to do any more normalization than HTTP_HOST, I'll just use HTTP_HOST.
[06:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can setup redirects for /resources to /wp-content/gw-resources/HTTP_HOST
[06:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> rworth, gnarf: Does this sound good?
[06:06:48] <rworth> sounds good to me
[06:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Should I even support this? $resource_path = get_option( 'gw_resource_path' );
[06:14:10] <bot-t> (6 hours 55 mins ago) <nacin> tell scott_gonzalez When setting up a multisite, the first site is going to be in wp-content/uploads, and the rest in blogs.dir. Hence $main_override. WP_CONTENT_DIR would not be site-specific. WP_CONTENT_URL (or rather, content_url()) would be. So I would do /resources/HTTP_HOST. Note that if you plan to have multiple app servers at one point, you may want to consider a separate VPS purely for serving static 
[06:14:38] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I don't see why I'd bother. Just hardcoded it at /resources; it's going to be hard-coded in the repo already.
[06:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the corresponding upload_path about configuring URLs, huh?
[06:16:09] <nacin> You could use that too.
[06:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> I was originally thinking it was about configuring where the data is stored on disk, but I'm realzing now they're tied together.
[06:16:18] <nacin> Yeah.
[06:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll just drop that.
[06:16:28] <nacin> You could do a rewrite underneath of course.
[06:16:36] <nacin> but that's no fun either.
[06:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> I just switched to defining a constant.
[06:19:19] <scott_gonzalez> That shouldn't cause any problems for multisite, right?
[06:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> Each run will only be for one site.
[06:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> define( 'GW_RESOURCE_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/gw-resources/' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '/' );
[06:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> (dropped the trailing slash)
[06:21:06] <nacin> seems fine to me.
[06:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I think the WordPress portion is done. Time to implement this in grunt-wordpress :-)
[10:47:39] <phpkiddy> im am a simple question
[10:48:10] <phpkiddy> when a browser download an image yellow.png for this image tag:
[10:48:56] <phpkiddy> <img src='/yellow.png'>
[10:49:22] <phpkiddy> does it send the cookie along to apache, when you are logged in using php sessions for example/
[10:49:24] <phpkiddy> ?
