[13:47:25] <mikesherov> anyone home?
[13:49:34] <agcolom> Hi mikesherov!
[13:49:44] <mikesherov> how's it going?
[13:50:01] <agcolom> Good! I'm on my own so deep into JQM and API docs!
[13:50:10] <agcolom> you?
[13:50:22] <mikesherov> coolâ€¦ sitting in a hotel lobby, scavenging internet
[13:50:41] <agcolom> Have you been badly affected by Sandy?
[13:50:46] <mikesherov> I needed wifi to publish my latest pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/808/files?w=1
[13:50:50] <mikesherov> Um, not terrible.
[13:51:30] <mikesherov> No power, no heat, no internetâ€¦ been staying with friends and at hotels. But my home is intact, and just waiting for the power to come back on
[13:52:15] <mikesherov> so, it's kind of weird, because I been working. So I go to the city during the day, which has everything, and then I come home and it's like darkness till I get to a friend's place
[13:52:20] <mikesherov> kind of surreal
[13:52:26] <agcolom> It's all over the French news if that can comfort you... Glad your home is intact and you're safe! Apparently evenings have been really cold as well....
[13:52:39] <mikesherov> yeah, and there is another storm coming Tuesday!
[13:52:47] <mikesherov> Hopefully I get power back before then!
[13:52:48] <agcolom> On French TV they said all power should be back by Monday I think!
[13:53:03] <agcolom> Must be terrible!
[13:53:20] <mikesherov> yeah, for Manhattan, Long Island and the other new york islands different story
[13:53:29] <mikesherov> it's pretty crazy
[13:53:44] <mikesherov> like, some people I know are just fine, some people I know are now literally homeless
[13:53:56] <agcolom> I think it's impossible to imagine!
[13:54:11] <mikesherov> well, you know what, this happens every day
[13:54:19] <mikesherov> there is suffering always somewhere in the world
[13:54:32] <mikesherov> most days, people choose to ignore it because it's not close to them
[13:54:40] <agcolom> oh yes that's true!
[13:55:08] <mikesherov> joy and suffering come in and out of our lives, and you just have to take it all in
[13:55:32] <agcolom> Lets hope for better days now :-)
[13:56:37] <mikesherov> yes
[13:56:45] <mikesherov> I'm in good spiritis
[13:56:57] <agcolom> Excellent!
[13:57:03] <mikesherov> I've been programming most of the time anyway :-)
[13:57:13] <mikesherov> giving me a chance to focus on the tasks at hand
[13:57:54] <agcolom> Exactly! That's part of the feel good factor! (for me it is)
[13:58:26] <mikesherov> yeah, for sure!
[14:00:25] <mikesherov> agcolom: how long have you been working on the project?
[14:00:52] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/808/files?w=1
[14:02:37] <agcolom> I joined the team in Oct 2011 but started following Oct 2010 and contributing around March 2011... maybe before...
[14:03:13] <agcolom> How about you?
[14:03:29] <mikesherov> Contributing since May 2011
[14:03:56] <agcolom> so about the same then :-)
[14:03:59] <mikesherov> yeah
[14:04:12] <mikesherov> exciting project to work on
[14:04:19] <mikesherov> tons of smart people
[14:04:30] <agcolom> yes! indeed!
[14:04:45] <gnarf> Jan 2011?
[14:05:00] <agcolom> hey gnarf !
[14:05:15] <agcolom> how's your presentation going?
[14:05:56] <gnarf> finishing touches
[14:06:00] <gnarf> the demos
[14:06:08] <agcolom> when are you flying?
[14:06:12] <gnarf> and watching some previous events talks to see if i missed anything
[14:06:14] <gnarf> friday
[14:06:42] <gnarf> kswedberg's boston talk had some good gotcha's i wanna repeat for instance
[14:07:16] <gnarf> however, I've learned to not animate two balls for any reason or i will be unable to describe the animations :)
[14:07:30] <gnarf> thanks kswedberg :)
[14:07:31] <kswedberg> ahahahaha. hey gnarl!
[14:07:38] <kswedberg> *gnarf
[14:09:09] <gnarf> kswedberg: had me laughing pretty hard at that one, if only i had been following along with slides :)
[14:09:22] <mikesherov> hey gnarf!
[14:09:48] <kswedberg> yeah, that was totally unintentional. caught me off guard. but had fun with it anyway. :)
[14:10:09] <mikesherov> gnarf: if you feel like a mindless code review: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/808/files?w=1
[14:10:36] <mikesherov> ^ puts MOST of the finishing touches on my test cleanup
[14:11:06] <gnarf> mikesherov: everything still passing?
[14:11:34] <mikesherov> gnarf: no NEW fails, but the same fails as before
[14:11:51] <mikesherov> I only refactored, no fixes
[14:12:09] <mikesherov> once this lands, I can actually do cleanup and fixes
[14:12:19] <gnarf> less globals seems solid
[14:12:32] <mikesherov> yes, no globals :-)
[14:12:52] <gnarf> you're responsible to fix it if scott_gonzalez yells about something ;)
[14:12:59] <mikesherov> key tenet of good testing is isolationâ€¦
[14:13:11] <mikesherov> yes, I introduced a fail of two earlier this week
[14:13:16] <mikesherov> I will fix it all :-)
[14:13:24] <mikesherov> fail or two*
[14:14:29] <mikesherov> petersendidit: hi! Thanks for starting in on sortable triage
[14:14:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] gnarf37 pushed 1 new commit to interactions: http://git.io/sAFcCQ
[14:14:35] <jquicommit> jquery-ui/interactions 884c020 Corey Frang: Merge branch 'master' into interactions...
[14:14:40] <gnarf> damnit
[14:14:53] <mikesherov> lol
[14:15:24] <gnarf> fast forwarded that commit
[14:15:54] <gnarf> and I force pushed the interactions branch back to wehre it should be scott_gonzalez - don't worry
[14:16:13] <gnarf> mikesherov: 3df9ea2 landed
[14:16:14] <petersendidit> mikesherov: np
[14:16:22] <mikesherov> thanks gnarf!
[14:16:40] <mikesherov> petersendidit: I'm going to work in on those tickets as wellâ€¦ any idea on how to split them up?
[14:16:55] <mikesherov> I can take even numbered tickets, you take odd?
[14:17:43] <petersendidit> That or you start at the top I start at the bottom
[14:18:04] <mikesherov> I like doing old tickets :-)
[14:18:20] <mikesherov> so I can start at lowest, or at even, your choice!
[14:18:28] <mikesherov> yeah, let's meet in the middle
[14:18:32] <mikesherov> I'll take lowest
[14:18:57] <petersendidit> Ok, I will work on the newest
[14:19:07] <gnarf> ?ts
[14:19:08] <bot-t> That's Sexualâ„¢
[14:19:16] <mikesherov> WAT
[14:19:22] <mikesherov> ?WAT
[14:19:22] * gnarf shrugs
[14:19:22] <bot-t> Boom! Did you are unimpressed? and now? http://bit.ly/i2SDjX
[14:19:44] <mikesherov> I just like that bot-t has a response to WAT
[14:19:49] <mikesherov> WAT

[14:25:08] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #757: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/757/
[14:25:09] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Dev: remove globals from tests and moved test helpers to correct location - Fixed #8770 Dev: Remove globals and Standardize Test Suite
[14:28:42] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: when/how do you decide that a method signature goes in an include? (e.g. https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/includes/animation-signature-options.xml)
[15:11:16] <petersendidit> mikesherov: what do you think about http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8407
[15:11:36] <petersendidit> seems more like a problem with what he is trying to do with the styling
[15:12:02] <petersendidit> other than his fix this seems to work to: http://jsfiddle.net/petersendidit/gtKtE/277/
[16:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: If it's used more than once.
[16:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'm home!
[16:31:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi!
[16:31:42] <agcolom> Did you drive?
[16:32:02] <agcolom> I've got another pb with the index page...
[16:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> flew
[16:32:54] <agcolom> much better! (less tiring)
[16:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> You should remove index.php and have a page.php that's like UI's.
[16:33:45] <agcolom> ok, thanks. That's in web-based-template? (is it as I described in the issue?)
[16:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[16:34:43] <agcolom> Ok, will do that tomorrow (safer as quite late right now ;-) )
[16:34:55] <agcolom> So you're changing time tonight?
[16:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[16:36:26] <scott_gonzalez> Google is awesome
[16:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1C373z321P1Y
[16:38:02] <agcolom> Indeed! I've just started documenting methods in the api docs!
[16:38:38] <agcolom> Still lots to do....
[16:39:06] <agcolom> I need to win the lottery to have more time!
[16:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[16:40:36] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I spotted something in the api.jqueryui.com
[16:41:57] <agcolom> the "About" tab is missing from the Blog selection
[16:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, the blog is a pain because it's not web-base-template.
[16:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get that fixed.
[16:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[16:43:05] <agcolom> np :-)
[16:43:22] <agcolom> hope you had a relaxing time...
[16:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> Somewhat relaxing. I think the only relaxing I get done is when I'm nowhere near electricity :-P
[16:46:26] <agcolom> Yep! I do that in France... no Internet... then you have to relax!
[16:46:57] <agcolom> Can I get your opinion on something? I need to document these methods:
[16:46:58] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/methods.html
[16:47:31] <agcolom> should I use $.mobile.changePage() or changePage() as method name?
[16:48:18] <agcolom> (I'm wondering because they are not all with  $.mobile.xxxx)
[16:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.mobile.changePage
[16:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage
[16:49:06] <agcolom> ok Thanks.
[16:49:23] <scott_gonzalez> And methods like $.fn.jqmData() are just jqmData (http://api.jquerymobile.com/jqmData/)
[16:49:55] <agcolom> Great! I was just going to ask ;-)
[16:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> If it's $.fn., then it's dropped, if it's anything else, the prefix stays.
[16:52:25] <agcolom> perfect!
[16:59:39] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've changed the name to jQuery.mobile.changePage (see http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/changepage/) but I should also change the filename to jQuery.mobile.changePage.xml or is changepage.xml ok?
[16:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> Change the filename too.
[17:00:07] <agcolom> ok. thanks!
[17:09:44] <agcolom> I think that's it from me for today.... (as it is already tomorrow here! )
[17:10:17] <agcolom> Have a good evening, and a good weekend...
