[02:18:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: tooltip as is works, but we could as well get rid of the buttons and just display the tooltip on the input, it'll then show up on focus as well, seems more useful to me
[02:20:40] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: scope works as expected

[02:42:48] <_zoggy_> yeah, dont like that dialog box for the tip
[02:42:55] <_zoggy_> as you have to click the close button to get rid of it..
[02:43:04] <_zoggy_> cant even click outside of the dialog to close

[04:16:54] <rxaviers> _zoggy_, hehe
[04:17:07] <_zoggy_> :)
[04:17:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, alright, will change
[04:26:49] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how about we drop the header for those two inputs and always show them?
[04:27:29] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #46: STILL FAILING in 25 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/46/
[04:27:56] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, dropping "CSS Scope" and "Theme Folder Name"?
[04:28:14] <jzaefferer> no, keeping those inputs, just dropping the header "Advanced Theme Settings"
[04:28:20] <jzaefferer> or keeping that, but without the toggling?
[04:28:37] <rxaviers> ah! alright

[04:59:48] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/tooltip] Get rid of Advanced Theme Settings header - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[04:59:53] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, removing the Adv Theme Settings header ^
[05:28:20] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: how about moving the scope option below the other input? would make more sense to group the select and theme name
[05:30:18] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, shift css scope vs. theme folder  name?
[05:30:32] <rxaviers> (swap)
[05:32:55] <jzaefferer> swap, yeah

[05:35:42] <jzaefferer> <strong>Please Note:</strong> If you provide a CSS scope, you will not get an example page included in your download.
[05:35:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, seems more logical
[05:35:55] <jzaefferer> actually not true, we include it anyway, but its not styled
[05:36:23] <jzaefferer> can we make the tooltip font-size bigger, and remove some of the top/right/bottom padding?
[05:38:24] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: also we could put the inputs next to the labels, to save on vertical space
[05:38:41] <jzaefferer> originally the were in a narrow column, we don't have that restriction anymore
[05:38:56] <jzaefferer> could also put the select next to the Theme header
[05:39:04] <jzaefferer> then the "select the theme…" text below that
[09:28:16] <jzaefferer> gnarf: can we integrate botio with https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api
[09:43:26] <jzaefferer> gnarf scott_gonzalez: shouldn't http://themeroller.com/ redirect to jqueryui.com/themeroller ?
[10:44:09] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: how would you feel about registering the widget factory as its own bower package?
[10:44:43] <timmywil> ajpiano: ^^
[10:46:03] <timmywil> help minimize the setup for plugins that actually use it
[11:03:49] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, In DL builder, we're using to the following versions: jquery (1.7.2), jqueryui (1.9.0-rc.1). Shall we update jquery version to 1.8 or remain in 1.7.2 anyway (since it's supported)?
[11:12:38] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez or jzaefferer: is selectmenu a real part of jQuery UI's API?
[11:15:59] <kswedberg> nvm
[16:02:47] <nacin> http://wordpress.org/news/2012/09/wordpress-3-5-beta-1/ - includes "jQuery UI 1.9 (and it’s not even released yet)"
