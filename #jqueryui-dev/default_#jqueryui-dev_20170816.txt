[15:19:17] <Robsdedude> Hi, I've encountered a bug I guess: Creating a dragable and chaning the helper's size in the start callback leads to an outdated containment (it's calculcated before). So the drag helper will collide with invisbile walls if it was bigger before.
[15:19:31] <Robsdedude> Any idea?
