[05:39:10] <rxaviers> hi scott_gonzalez, have some time to talk about the blog post?
[05:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: sure
[05:59:40] <rxaviers> We have served 1,730,000 downloads so far. I'm updating the numbers there...
[05:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[05:59:56] <rxaviers> Every single percentage of the post have changed. Some of them are not simply a copy/paste from splunk. But, aggregated stats, which I manually did to make the numbers easier to read and to make more sense. Eg. custom component selection. It doesn't make sense to simply list the components rank without taking into account the dependency across them. If we look at the plain rank, we see the winners are: core, widget, mouse, position, etc. But, Datepicke
[05:59:56] <rxaviers> r is actually the custom component winner, which comprises of two user selections: (a) datepicker and its dependencies, plus (b) Datepicker, mouse and position.
[06:00:09] <rxaviers> I'm ok re-calculating them. But, only if you really think it's important. Because, if we look at it tomorrow, it wont be the same numbers again. Plus, the important thing, which is the rank, is still the same. I mean, the order of the most-chosen-things are still the same (although the percentages have changed).
[06:00:14] <rxaviers> This is the latest-blog-post preview: http://blog.jqueryui.com/?p=1127&preview=true
[06:01:35] <rxaviers> I remember you saying you want that graph of downloads per time. Im adding that.
[06:01:40] <rxaviers> wanted*
[06:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:01:59] <rxaviers> what do you think?
[06:02:07] <rxaviers> overall
[06:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[06:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's ready to go.
[06:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if jzaefferer or ajpiano wanted to review.
[06:08:56] <rxaviers> cool
[06:09:19] <rxaviers> they have done so in the past.. But, let's wait for them to say so ;)
[06:09:34] <ajpiano> hi
[06:10:40] <ajpiano> rxaviers: can you change "At the current date" to "As of today"
[06:10:52] <ajpiano> change Javascript to JavaScript
[06:11:43] <ajpiano> and change "so you can share it" to "so it's easy to share or go back and modify a custom theme."
[06:11:51] <ajpiano> otherwise, seems pretty good!
[06:14:38] <rxaviers> ajpiano is the guy. I wish I could think/speak english using those much nicer expressions
[06:14:40] <rxaviers> hehe
[06:14:56] <ajpiano> i wish i could speak portuguese................at all
[06:14:57] <ajpiano> so
[06:14:58] <ajpiano> you win
[06:14:58] <ajpiano> :)
[06:15:14] <rxaviers> lol
[06:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Let me know if you want me to go over the tests with you.
[06:24:53] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez sure if you have a sec
[06:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> Skype?
[06:28:08] <DaveMethvin> sure
[07:33:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/138
[07:33:32] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #138 by jzaefferer (2w 2d ago): Link to this issue tracker on /downloadand and /themeroller
[07:33:39] <rxaviers> where's the best place to link you think?
[08:40:37] <rxaviers> ajpiano, I've added a chart and one more note sentence "Although, we still have a significant amount of 1.9.x downloads after the 1.10.x release, splitting the total as chart below shows." on the 5th paragraph. Could you please pass your ajpiano-transform-filter in it too?
[10:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> yay, blog post is live: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2013/04/1000000-custom-downloads-in-four-months/
[10:58:08] <rxaviers> :)
[12:46:12] <petersendidit> sorry I missed the meeting, first time I have gotten back to my desk all day.
[12:47:01] <petersendidit> Read through the stuff about the classes option talk. So we want to move things like ui-widget and ui-widget-content out of the "optional" classes, correct?
[12:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: yeah
[12:54:57] <scott_gonzalez> I could've sworn you pointed out a pain point with the current implementation.
[12:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> But there are no comments on the PR.
[12:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> So one place mixins would be really nice is being able to mix ui-helper-reset and ui-helper-clearfix into ui-tabs-nav.
