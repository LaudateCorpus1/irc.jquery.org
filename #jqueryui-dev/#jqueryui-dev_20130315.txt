[08:57:50] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: good call on disabling the qunit task on Jenkins. Also on updating grunt-contrib-csslint.
[08:58:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any thoughts on enabling Travis for jQuery UI? Would run that qunit test for our own commits, on all branches, as well as for all PRs
[08:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[08:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> That's what we're moving everything to eventually, right?
[09:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-contrib-csslint was interesting. I had a feeling there wouldn't be support for .csslintrc, then I saw that it was just added.
[09:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> I was fully expecting to have to file an issue and send a PR.
[09:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> CSSLint doesn't mention it in their docs.
[09:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> I had actually expected to be filing an issue against CSSLint.
[09:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> But I read through the code and found that it had existed for a while.
[09:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> Just wasn't documented.
[09:19:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: its actually documented on the wiki somewhere at the bottom of some config-related page
[09:19:52] <jzaefferer> That's where Sebastian (@asciidisco) found it
[09:20:09] <jzaefferer> Also there's now another PR that changes the format to what CSSLint actually expects in the .csslintrc
[09:20:14] <jzaefferer> Which is a pretty terrible format
[09:22:26] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-csslint/pull/6
[09:22:26] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Pull request #6 by stevenbenner (1h 41m ago): Changed .csslintrc file support to use CSSLint specification
[09:25:29] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: the support is mentioned pretty close to the bottom here: https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/wiki/Command-line-interface
[09:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, didn't look there :-P
[09:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's pretty shitty.

The same code works fine in 1.9.2.  Here is a fiddle that works against 1.9.2: http://jsfiddle.net/murdog/sysPX/12/  and the broken one against 1.10.2: http://jsfiddle.net/murdog/sysPX/10/  - thx!
