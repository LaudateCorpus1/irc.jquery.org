[00:23:08] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: it's still super raw in terms of where the site is, but .... zeee nanoc, she iz dead
[00:24:30] <ajpiano> i had been reluctant to pull the trigger without getting every single thing that was working in nanoc over to node, but then i was just like, we have to be done with ruby and we'll triage what's broken atomically
[00:24:43] <ajpiano> and that is what i will commence
[00:24:47] <ajpiano> tomorrow
[00:24:59] <ajpiano> but thought you would enjoy waking up to the news that the ruby is no more
[02:23:40] <_zoggy_> Those people are in for quite a few changes with Opera 12.10, the latest beta of which was released today: Retina Display support in OS X, touch support in Windows 7 and Windows 8, and a smattering of new APIs and Web standards are all included in the new browser, which is available here.
[02:24:51] <_zoggy_> In the Web standards department, it also adds support for "unprefixed" CSS3 gradients, transitions, animations, and transforms, meaning that developers will no longer need to add a special -o- prefix to get this code to render properly in Opera, reducing the amount of browser-specific testing that must be performed. Support for the latest draft of the Fullscreen API, the Page Visibility
[02:24:52] <_zoggy_> API, the Web Sockets API, and ICC color profiles has also been added.

[04:55:56] <scott_gonzalez> FML
[04:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The site errors out in IE.
[04:57:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, noticed that. I guess that's a little too harsh
[04:59:22] <jzaefferer> _zoggy_: What does "users" mean here? Is it relevant for jqueryui.com? I don't think so
[05:01:31] <jzaefferer> _zoggy_: IE versions on jqueryui.com in the last 30 days: http://bassistance.de/i/9fec2b.png (no idea how accurate that is though)
[05:03:44] <jzaefferer> Those numbers are visits, not page views
[05:15:28] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, majority of IE have been 9 and 8 then. better
[05:16:36] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I didnt have time to look at the whole bug list yet.
[05:18:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, as far as I see, TR is very buggy on IE for two things: layout (display table for tabular display, I plan to roll it back to float:left like the current side panel is implemented); And js is halting in IE <- I dont know yet where it fails
[05:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure what it fails either. I'll be looking into it in a little bit.
[05:26:08] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #54: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/54/
[05:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> Can anyone reproduce this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8587
[05:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing the described behavior.
[05:38:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i do not see it in FF in ML but do on Windows via Browserstack :/
[05:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> ?!?
[05:38:26] <kborchers> right
[05:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: What about /4/ ?
[05:38:42] <kborchers> tested both via Browserstack to make sure and same result
[05:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> I added a console.log( document.activeElement )
[05:38:45] <kborchers> checking now
[05:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> Because some browsers will keep the button focused after click.
[05:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> And if it's focused it looks the same as if it's hovered.
[05:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> So the behavior would be correct in that case.
[05:42:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: how do i get that firebug panel in jsfiddle? if i right click and show the console for the full window i'm not getting anything logged
[05:44:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: got it and yes activeElement is the button
[05:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll close the ticket.
[05:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[05:44:28] <kborchers> np
[05:45:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: still weird that it only does it on windows
[05:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> It might just be a difference in how the OS handles focus.
[05:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> Though that wouldn't explain why some browsers behave differently in OS X.
[05:47:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm just going to pretend i didn't notice :P
[05:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[05:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna get ready, then I'll look into that TR issue with IE.
[05:54:10] <rxaviers> Anyone want to discuss how to layout TR using float:left? Currently, if you look at http://stage.jqueryui.com/themeroller/ in FF or chrome you'll see the dynamics I wanted for TR. It is: (TR app)  : (A) : (B) panels, where (TR app) and (B) have fixed size, and (A) fills the remaining space. But, if you make window small enough, (A) and (B) will both go to (TR app) bottom
[05:55:08] <rxaviers> Im having a hard time to implement this using floating divs, because of the (B) auto width. If I make all three fixed sizes, it works. But, when you have big window you waste space.
[06:03:09] <rxaviers> i think I have an idea..
[06:13:40] <rxaviers> this is what I think and will implement to fix TR on IE: http://jsfiddle.net/S3CKu/
[06:16:34] <rxaviers> tested and works on IE6 and IE7, \o/
[06:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Please use media queries for the layout change.
[06:19:42] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah! media queries tells css what layout to use depending of the width right
[06:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/css/base.css#L2690
[06:20:52] <rxaviers> excellent! ok I will then
[06:20:53] <rxaviers> thks
[06:21:07] * rxaviers needs to leave now
[06:21:14] <rxaviers> brb in 3h30
[06:34:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I just opened TR in a local IE7 VM and a local IE8 VM and it worked fine.
[06:36:28] <rxaviers> mm really?
[06:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's still totally busted in BrowserStack though, no idea why.
[06:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> Hard to debug something that crashes :-/
[06:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[07:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm slowly making progress on this.
[07:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's fun when your debugging cross three repositories :-P
[07:29:27] <scott_gonzalez> I think I tracked down all the problems.
[07:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> Now time to implement fixes.

[07:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> SUCCESS!
[07:59:08] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, about the build.. what ive seen people do before is that all you do is run a script that calculates each widget size and pass that off to the ui.. so when it displays what all widgets it shows the bytes there.. then theres is a simple js that takes all the checked off byte value and adds them up.. convert to human readable format and display
[07:59:29] <_zoggy_> so its not like its being computed on the fly all the time or anything
[07:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: That's bad. I'd rather not show values than show source values.
[08:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> The only value that matters is the minified + concatenated + gzipped size.
[08:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> I say this because we'll just get lots of complaints about how bloated UI is.
[08:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm tired of hearing this nonsense :-P
[08:02:14] <ajpiano> s/'ll//

[10:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think the proxies are caching files for jqueryui.com
[10:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically http://jqueryui.com/download/jquery-ui-1.8.24.custom.zip needs to be refreshed.
[10:40:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[10:41:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the old proxies?
[10:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:44:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: curious, old.jqueryui.com suffer from same problem?
[10:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Let me check.
[10:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:47:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: okay, cuz I don't think proxy is caching anything
[10:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> Let me confirm that I deployed the fix.
[10:48:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: to the old site?
[10:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> This was last week, the day that I did the 1.8.24 release.
[10:50:27] <gnarf> i'm a lil confused about whats going on with /download url - I don't see anything special in the apache/nginx for it, but there isn't a folder named download - I assume this is handled by something in the wordpress?
[10:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> This is the old site. No WordPress.
[10:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're talking about stage.jqueryui.com/download
[10:55:05] <gnarf> no
[10:55:10] <gnarf> jqueryui.com/download
[10:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> It turns out I never merged this fix into the production branch.
[10:55:30] <gnarf> root@ve01:/srv/jqueryui.com/htdocs# ls -al download
[10:55:30] <gnarf> ls: cannot access download: No such file or directory

[10:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> .htaccess
[10:57:35] <gnarf> aha
[10:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, so I still had the terminal tab open, with the svn merge command fully typed out.
[10:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> Never hit enter.
[10:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> But I did redeploy to both servers.
[10:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> Not so useful without actually doing the merge :-/
[10:58:06] <gnarf> heh
[10:58:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this permission issue?
[10:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> Seeing that reminded me that this was the issue we were having with the download script.
[10:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> It was trying to build and failed.
[10:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, jqueryui.com is now serving the fixed zip.
[11:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It seems like the script just isn't running as the correct user, right?
[11:00:24] <gnarf> as of now, it should be running correct
[11:00:28] <gnarf> as jqdeploy
[11:00:34] <gnarf> and things should be owned by jqdeploy
[11:00:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: at least on stage
[11:00:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: btw, did you see my screenshot last night about the node-gyp error with syslog?
[11:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yup
[11:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> I thought that was what we were talking about just now :-P
[11:02:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[11:02:28] <gnarf> okay
[11:02:30] <gnarf> now its working

[11:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> We will damnit actually release.
[11:06:38] <gnarf> yup

[11:36:32] <rxaviers> will test using browserstack too
[11:36:35] <rxaviers> thks
[11:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Bump it up to 230px fixed it.
[11:36:51] <rxaviers> Im rewriting the layout now to use that floating approach
[11:36:52] <rxaviers> Ok
[11:37:02] <rxaviers> will rewrite and use 230px then
[11:37:21] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thanks for fixing the other stuff

[12:33:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, are we doin this?
[12:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on the changelog right now.
[12:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> This will probably take about 15 more minutes.
[12:35:10] <gnarf> k
[12:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> Once that's done, we should be good to go.
[12:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Taking much more than 15 minutes :-/
[12:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> so many changes
[12:53:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no prob

[13:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well if we don't get it done tonight, it can wait till Monday.
[13:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> At a minimum I'm going to get the repos all updated and I'll get 1.9.0 on our CDN and notify Google and MS.

[13:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> It really is.
[14:40:55] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im having a hard time with the layout. The way I thought it would work (tested via jsfiddle above) is not. I have found this approach http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/ultimate-3-column-blog-style-pixels.htm
[14:41:15] <rxaviers> If you have anything against it please just let me know. I'm implementing this right now..

[18:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> That's in bytes?

[18:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check it in IE 8, if it looks good, we'll deploy.
[18:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I still need to update the CDN.
[18:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm going to get a bit more done tonight, but I think we should wait till Monday to deploy the sites.
[18:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> Not really worth doing a big deploy and announcement at 10:00p on a Friday.

[18:57:20] <jquicommit> [jqueryui.com/master] Update release date for 1.9.0. - Scott González
[19:37:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: agreed
[19:46:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: although it would be pretty awesome to actually release that today :)
[19:46:44] <gnarf> maybe google/microsoft CDNs will actually have it when we release? :)
