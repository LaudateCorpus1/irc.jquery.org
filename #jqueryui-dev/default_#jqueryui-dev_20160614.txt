[08:12:56] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[10:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> gabrielschulhof: Can you please set the correct version for https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14984?
[10:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> Surely this exists in at least one of the pre-releases.
[13:23:54] <gabrielschulhof> scott_gonzalez: Actually, I don't think so, because arschmitz only recently added this. The problem was introduced at only master~8.
[13:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> oh...
[13:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> So this is from the fix for the other bug you reported?
[13:24:24] <gabrielschulhof> scott_gonzalez: I'm currently watching controlgroup /very/ closely, because I need to integrate it with mobile's selectmenu.
[13:24:31] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[13:24:34] <gabrielschulhof> It's a refinement.
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> got it
[13:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[13:24:40] <gabrielschulhof> NP!
