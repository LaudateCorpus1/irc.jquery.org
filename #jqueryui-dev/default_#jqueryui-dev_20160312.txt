[22:38:08] <mr_kitten> Hi
[22:40:52] <mr_kitten> The native select menu button idea listed under GSoC '16 page - the task is to create a customized version of the native select button right?
[22:43:31] <mr_kitten> Since the menu part of native select widget cannot be stylized, the current version was created using list items, if I'm not wrong 
[22:45:34] <mr_kitten> So the task at hand is to preserve the native select menu, but only change the appearance of the select button
[22:46:16] <mr_kitten> Similar to what is already present in jquery-mobile : http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/selectmenu/
[22:46:33] <mr_kitten> Please correct me if I'm wrong
[22:49:23] <mr_kitten> arschmitz, you seem to be the mentor for this project. could you please help me out with this?
[22:50:33] <arschmitz> mr_kitten: yes that is correct
[23:44:05] <mr_kitten> Great. How do you suggest I start working on it?
[23:47:12] <mr_kitten> Should I make some Js mockups perhaps?
[23:48:02] <mr_kitten> How do I go about drafting a proposal for the project?
