[05:43:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: will land right now
[05:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[05:43:35] <arschmitz> if your stil ok with it
[05:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:43:43] <arschmitz> i forgot all about it 
[05:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> I figured :-)
[05:56:12] <gabriel_1chulhof> arschmitz: Tests are now green.

[06:01:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_1chulhof: thanks
[06:01:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_1chulhof: i have no idea what that jsbin is suposed to be showing
[06:01:23] <gabriel_1chulhof> arschmitz: Swipe left on a list item.
[06:01:29] <gabriel_1chulhof> It's cool. It's swipe-to-reveal.
[06:01:39] <arschmitz> oh thats a direct copy of the new ios
[06:02:06] <gabriel_1chulhof> Not sure if we wanna make an extension about that. I mean, it's easy enough to implement, as the bin itself shows. Might be a nice feature though.
[06:02:21] <gabriel_1chulhof> A lot of degrees of freedom though, so I dunno ...
[06:02:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_1chulhof: does not really seem like a good use case for listview
[06:02:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_1chulhof: its much more generic for that
[06:02:54] <arschmitz> it does not even seem like you really need it to be a widget
[06:02:57] <arschmitz> since its just a reveal
[06:03:08] <arschmitz> it could just probably be a plugin
[06:03:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I meant an extension to listview.
[06:03:33] <arschmitz> or a widget byitself maybe
[06:03:36] <arschmitz> it still has state
[06:03:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right what im saying is i dont see it being specific to listview
[06:03:56] <arschmitz> andthing can be swiped to reveal potentially
[06:03:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, I see ...
[06:04:06] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI build #1516: SUCCESS in 4 min 26 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI/1516/
[06:04:07] <doesallmagic2> arschmitz: Theme: Disabled elements can still be focused with a click
[06:04:34] <arschmitz> and i dont see it as part of the lib really but it does seem to work really nice
[06:04:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Whew! That's a lot of widgets though if we go per-list-item.
[06:04:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, for sure.
[06:05:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Not sure how we could provide any useful abstraction.
[06:05:12] <arschmitz> maybe a demo 
[06:05:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, not a bad idea.
[06:05:48] <arschmitz> when we re-write lists
[06:05:58] <arschmitz> we can look at most common ways they are used at that time
[06:06:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Man ... sooo much on our plate ...
[06:06:09] <arschmitz> and decide from there what makes sense for extensions to include
[06:06:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: always
[06:07:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i also would not consider anything involving touch right now
[06:07:30] <arschmitz> until we finish pointer events
[06:07:34] <arschmitz> and pull in interactions
[06:07:48] <arschmitz> because draggable will be the key to making things like that properly
[06:08:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait, is it? This is canned animation, not open-ended.
[06:08:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the real thing is actually draggable with tolerances
[06:08:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[06:08:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, then definitely.
[06:09:37] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... I think my DNS service just broke. I might have to restart my router :/ Don't be surprised if I drop off the face of the Earth :)
[06:10:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you live in finland
[06:10:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: didnt that already happen :-)
[06:10:45] <arschmitz> isnt that why its so cold?
[06:22:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Temperatures are still a smidgen above 2.7K :)
[06:23:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so we're still hanging on ...
[06:23:44] <arschmitz> rocking -6 right this moment here
[06:24:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, then gotcha beat. We're above freezing.
[06:24:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thats ok sfrisk just WALKED to work lol
[06:24:40] <arschmitz> im inside all nice and warm still in my pj's lol
[06:24:46] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[06:25:08] <sfrisk> Is it -6?
[06:25:13] <sfrisk> I thought it felt warm today
[06:25:15] <arschmitz> thats what it says 
[06:25:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I guess -6 around your place is much worse than -6 around here, given that humidity here is, like, non-existent.
[06:25:26] <arschmitz> sfrisk: Celcious
[06:25:35] <sfrisk> indeed.
[06:25:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: is in finland
[06:25:43] <sfrisk> -6 Celsius is warm.
[06:25:46] <arschmitz> so i convert
[06:26:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I was reading about the 10 anniversary of Huygens landing on Titan yesterday. I looked at the footage of its descent, and noticed the temperature was -180Â°C ... I thought to myself: "Not too bad".
[06:26:18] <gabriel_schulhof> What's that, like, 25Â°F ... off the top of my head ...
[06:26:35] <arschmitz> 22
[06:26:39] <arschmitz> pretty close
[06:27:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we have recent been in the -20c range
[06:27:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Then we must be edging towards 40Â°F ...
[06:27:39] <arschmitz> today is warm compared to what its been recently
[06:28:43] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... where o where did our dear vortex go. It hath truly deserted us *sniff*
[06:28:55] <arschmitz> i can tell you where it went
[06:28:57] <arschmitz> RIGHT HERE
[06:29:00] <arschmitz> lol
[06:32:12] <gabriel_schulhof> https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Hn-enjcgV1o#t=61
[06:33:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyhoo ... no use moping ... might as well implement some classes options as a consolation ...
[06:34:54] <sfrisk> When it was around -24 Celsius the other day I wasn't thrilled about walking to work
[06:34:59] <sfrisk> especially since it was really windy
[06:49:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Brrr ... I cuddled up into my armchair just reading that ... 
[06:59:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What did we say about classes like ui-corner-all and ui-shadow? There was talk of not placing those on the right hand side of a class key. How then will I translate data-corners="true" into classes?
[06:59:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... just need a reminder.
[06:59:45] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose those can go in the extras param, right?
[07:12:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no those are 100% values
[07:12:47] <arschmitz> those are like the only things that are lol
[07:15:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. Understood. In other news, I'm looking at ui-1-12-tests, and I'm not seeing the new APIs in external/jquery-ui/widget.js
[07:15:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[07:15:29] <gabriel_schulhof> Re: Them being values.
[07:15:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Like cat external/jquuery-ui/widgets.js | grep _addClass is empty.
[07:16:00] <arschmitz> hmm
[07:16:04] <gabriel_schulhof> widget.js, I mean.
[07:16:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... my branch ui-1-12 has diverged ... WTF?!
[07:16:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: just a sec let me check something
[07:19:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I think when you rebased ui-1-12, you forgot to rebase the commits for some of the PRs that were against ui-1-12 you had approved. That's why they diverged.
[07:19:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but I'm not sure.
[07:21:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, NM. I found the _isLocal() fix, so the other commits are probably in there as well.
[07:23:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh shoot i know what i did
[07:23:09] <arschmitz> i didnt change the ui branch name
[07:23:23] <arschmitz> so when i updated dependencies it pulled them from the old branch
[07:23:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[07:23:47] <gabriel_schulhof> No worries. Just slap the new files on top of ui-1-12-tests, and we're all good.

[07:31:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: after Scott piled on over 100 comments on the classes PR, it gets pretty difficult for me to see updates from you regarding my part of the review. I'm not sure how to deal with that :/
[07:32:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i updated everything you mentioned i think except anything i may have commented back about though its likely lost in the torrent now
[07:35:22] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay, I think I got all your comments before Scott started and replied where needed, so it should be fine
[07:35:33] <jzaefferer> I'll take another look once you've addressed everything...
[07:35:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: on the bright side about 95% of what he commented on was purely formatting
[07:35:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: and pretty much everything that was not was related to tests
[07:35:54] <arschmitz> so the api should be stable
[07:39:15] <jzaefferer> alright
[07:39:26] <jzaefferer> really need to get jscs running for tests/

[07:42:45] <arschmitz> our old code is HORRIBLE
[07:42:54] <arschmitz> we cant run jscs right now
[07:43:21] <jzaefferer> use what?
[07:43:24] <jzaefferer> esformatter?
[07:43:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:28:45] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: landed some more of the jQuery style guide in jscs 1.10

[11:11:48] <FMB> Hi there, when I build jquery-ui locally using "grunt concat" it just concatenates all files with all AMD modules. But when I download jquery ui from the site, it has a single "define" call. How could I build jquery-ui locally the same way it is provided for download in the site? Where is the code that generates the released file with a single "def
[11:11:48] <FMB> ine" call, is it public?
