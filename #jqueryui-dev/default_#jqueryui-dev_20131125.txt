[01:43:23] <Akbert88> hello somebody can speak Spanish?
[01:44:25] <Akbert88> nobody here?
[01:53:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[01:53:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[01:53:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Looking at https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/152 ...
[01:53:44] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #152 by gabrielschulhof (38m 7s ago): Javascript error when moving from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0-beta.1
[01:54:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It seems that "global-icon-disc-alt" is undefined when going from 1.4.0-beta.1 to 1.3.2, and that's why it's failing.
[01:54:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we have global-icon-disc-alt in 1.4.0?
[01:54:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lemme check
[01:55:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You check that in css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css, right?
[01:55:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[01:55:50] <uGoMobi> line 164: /*{global-icon-disc-alt}*/
[01:55:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[01:56:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait ... the JS error happens when moving from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0-beta.1 ...
[01:56:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I don't understand why that's failing
[01:56:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll have to see where it drops the value.
[01:58:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we didn't have it in 1.3.2
[01:59:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, so that would explain it.
[02:00:04] <uGoMobi> yup
[02:00:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So then, when moving to 1.4.0, you have to copy the other icon colour.
[02:00:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, rather the other disc colour.
[02:00:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we already had regular and alt icon disc bg color in 1.3
[02:00:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you couldn't set the alt version with the TR
[02:01:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see ...

[02:01:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suggest  for now we leave it as it was, meaning we remove the /*{global-icon-disc-alt}*/ comment from the default theme
[02:01:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, but was the alt version labelled in the CSS with the special comment?
[02:01:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[02:02:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I think we'll have to do that.
[02:02:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Meaning that the alt disc colour will continue to not be editable via TR, right?

[02:03:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[02:03:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can open a ticket for it, so we can see if we want to fix it later
[02:04:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but not for 1.4
[02:05:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/150#issuecomment-29189410
[02:05:32] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #150 by uGoMobi (3d 9h ago): Make changes to comments/order in the default theme in the JQM repo (if needed)
[02:06:01] <uGoMobi> I just added a comment there
[02:09:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I removed it and the error is still happening, so I'm a bit confused.
[02:09:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do I need to remove it from 1.3.2 as well?
[02:10:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, we can't make any changes in already released versions
[02:10:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wait ... it also appears in jqm.starter.theme.css
[02:10:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was about to say that
[02:10:58] <uGoMobi> it is confusing, I know
[02:11:37] <_|Nix|_> OK ... we're good.
[02:12:01] <uGoMobi> great
[02:14:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I closed https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/152>
[02:14:37] <uGoMobi> ok
[02:15:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and pushed the change that gets rid of the comment.
[02:16:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But there's still a problem ... when moving from 1.4.0-beta.1 to 1.3.2 the global-icon-set is undefined.
[02:16:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So the preview for 1.3.2 shows no icons.
[02:17:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I think it's because global-icon-set is not defined in 1.4.0.
[02:17:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we need to keep the original value when going from 1.4.0 to 1.3.x.
[02:17:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct, that one is gone
[02:17:58] <uGoMobi> but how can that break 1.3.2?
[02:18:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It breaks when you move from 1.4.0 to 1.3.2 because it tries to migrate the value, but there is no value to migrate.
[02:18:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we only have to look at going from 1.3.2 to 1.4, downgrading is not option
[02:19:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK, because you can move arbitrarily between versions using the dropdown.
[02:19:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, we should show a dialog or an alert or something when someone tries to go down from 1.4.0.
[02:19:51] <uGoMobi> yeah, maybe something we can improve later
[02:20:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:20:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not a high priority if you ask me
[02:20:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: who makes a 1.4 custom theme and then switch to 1.3.2 ?
[02:20:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Then I'll close https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/153 without any fix.
[02:20:59] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #153 by gabrielschulhof (1h 3m ago): Icons missing and corners broken when moving from 1.4.0-beta.1 to 1.3.2
[02:21:05] <uGoMobi> but yes, it's possible with the select dropdown menu
[02:22:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you could leave it open and just remove the milestone
[02:22:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:22:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe later we can add something so things don't break
[02:22:47] <uGoMobi> we can make changes to the TR in between releases
[02:23:27] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[02:23:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Although we also have to keep in mind that an entirely new TR is on its way ...
[02:24:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man ... so many moving parts ...
[02:24:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes exactly
[02:24:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: now we only do the minimum to make it work with 1.4 and upgrading from 1.3 to 1.4
[02:24:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll take https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/147, OK?
[02:24:54] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #147 by uGoMobi (3d 10h ago): Themeable active state
[02:24:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: after that we can fix issues but only if it's not taking too much time

[04:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> Going through the history to figure out what to cherry-pick is gonna suck, but I think it needs to finally happen.
[05:00:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay
[05:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll start working on that today.
[05:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> Might take a while.
[05:20:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Argh! The panel is initialized before the version of TR is established!
[05:21:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ohw :(
[05:21:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe we can add a version class to the panel container and just hide 1.4 stuff with CSS
[05:22:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know, not really neat solution
[05:22:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can read an element in the DOM to find out the version, but that element is so far getting read in exactly one place - to set the value of TR.version ...
[05:22:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It is the current solution.
[05:22:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We must also show stuff in 1.4 we do not show in < 1.4 ...
[05:23:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I'll read the same DOM element in initPanel() that is used to establish TR.version ...

[05:49:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, thanks for the link. I havent started  handling CSS dep. implementation. Any due date in mind for the ui+mobile db thing? Just let me know if we should prioritize that
[05:52:07] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: ASAP for UI 1.11, which includes AMD support
[05:52:23] <rxaviers> it's not a requirement for 1.11
[05:52:50] <rxaviers> although, it's better, it's not mandatory. Right?
[05:53:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez wants to ship 1.11 with AMD support, that makes it mandatory
[05:54:15] <rxaviers> one thing is AMD, another is this CSS handling thing
[05:54:22] <rxaviers> I had reopened https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/151 to make sure DB supports 1.11
[05:54:23] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #151 by rxaviers (5mon 3d ago): Support jQuery UI 1.11

[07:49:04] <JamesMGreene> Good morning/afternoon/evening/night, jQuery compatriots
[07:49:36] <JamesMGreene> Can someone tell me what CSS theme is included in the default (non-custom) stable build of jQuery UI?
[07:52:57] <JamesMGreene> arschmitz gseguin scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll jzaefferer kborchers RWhitbeck rxaviers et al: What CSS theme is included in the jQuery UI "stable download"?
[07:53:58] <tj_vantoll> JamesMGreene: smoothness by default
[07:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> smoothness
[07:54:27] <rxaviers> ui-lightness
[07:54:39] <JamesMGreene> rxaviers: You
[07:54:45] <JamesMGreene> rxaviers: You've been outvoted
[07:54:51] <rxaviers> hehe
[07:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:55:20] <JamesMGreene> thanks guys
[07:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> ui-lightness is the default theme, but the stable build contains smoothness.
[07:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> The stable build just uses what's in the repo.
[07:55:48] <JamesMGreene> kinda confused ;)
[07:55:50] <JamesMGreene> err
[07:55:52] <JamesMGreene> confusing*
[07:56:15] <JamesMGreene> ui-lightness = popular, smoothness = barebones?
[07:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's not the actual smoothness theme :-P
[07:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> smoothness = processed base
[07:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> So it's the exact same look, but it's gone through download builder and has all the token replaced.
[07:57:10] <scott_gonzalez> The stable build is just the base theme, so it still has all the tokens in it.
[07:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure who decided we should use a different theme for the default in download builder.
[07:57:44] <scott_gonzalez> Probably FG.
[07:59:16] <JamesMGreene> Who's FG?
[07:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> Filament Group
[07:59:40] <JamesMGreene> oh, sure, was trying to associate it to a single person
[08:00:14] <JamesMGreene> Anyway, that's more than enough info for today's endeavor. Thanks again!

[09:04:55] <_zoggy_> anyone have any experience with them.. using latest version of jQuery, which i thought was suppose to detect and adds the appropriate vendor prefix to make it work. it works in chrome/ff/safari.. 
[09:08:16] <jzaefferer> _zoggy_: what IE version are you looking at? Looks like you need -ms for IE9, no prefix for 10: http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d
[09:12:54] <_zoggy_> jzaefferer, tried IE11
[09:26:56] <jzaefferer> That shouldn't need any prefixing
[09:30:33] <_zoggy_> right
[09:38:17] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Wow. That was quick/awesome https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/commit/b0d545b9b431e733a63f2bcabfcdec2e033f671e

[12:58:58] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/061-4 14d543318 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: slider: converted the example from xhtml to html
[12:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: We were told (years ago) that programmatic focus should be async in certain situations for accessibility.
[13:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> We discussed this in Amsterdam. We want to remove it from the places where we do it and test in all of our supported browser/AT combos.
[13:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> See if we can just get rid of it completely and remove the .focus() override in UI core.
[13:01:03] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: hi, anyone around? 
[13:01:18] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[13:01:24] <agcolom> Hi Jasper!
[13:01:44] <agcolom> quick question... in 1.4, what should people use to get a slider?
[13:01:55] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Ok cool. In this case in particular there are two async things the test must wait for, so I have to use an arbitrary number like 10 milliseconds to make sure the test works.
[13:02:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: still same slider as before (range input)
[13:02:14] <agcolom> (we say in the docs that slider is deprecated)
[13:02:31] <agcolom> we say the slider widget.
[13:02:37] <agcolom> is deprecated
[13:02:41] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, so we are free to replace/change it in 1.5

[13:03:03] <agcolom> ok. 
[13:03:18] <agcolom> and what is the plan? (what do we replace it with? the UI one?)
[13:03:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that widget needs a complete rewrite so that's why we deprecated it all together
[13:04:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when we develop a new widget it should be for both UI and Mobile
[13:04:19] <agcolom> I'm confused.... ;-) (ok I easily get confused ;-) )
[13:04:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What's up?
[13:04:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the UI slider isn't based on a form element
[13:04:47] <agcolom> I thought when we say something is deprecated it is so that people stop using it...
[13:05:10] <agcolom> but actually what we're saying is we're going to change it....?
[13:05:15] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Exactly. 
[13:05:17] <agcolom> Hi Gabriel !
[13:05:21] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hey!
[13:05:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you are right that normally the new feature is already available when we deprecate the old one
[13:05:50] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: "Stop using it, but don't worry, we won't leave you high and dry. A new one is coming!"
[13:06:05] <agcolom> right...
[13:06:28] <agcolom> and the new one will also be based on input type="range" ?
[13:06:33] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yes.
[13:07:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: In fact, I don't think people should notice much, although the API may end up different - which is why we're covering our collective behinds with a period of deprecation.
[13:07:17] <agcolom> ah! great. So actually, the code written by the say front-end dev will remain the same? 
[13:07:26] <agcolom> (or similar... 
[13:07:33] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if it will still be the range input
[13:07:35] <agcolom> so maybe just some options will differ)
[13:07:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We dunno for sure - hence the deprecation.
[13:07:54] <agcolom> ok... 
[13:08:08] <uGoMobi> because we change the range input into a number input
[13:08:15] <uGoMobi> during enhancement
[13:08:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There's a thorny issue with the range input because we cannot suppress the native slider. We convert it to a number input by /deleting/ the range input and create a replacement number input.
[13:08:36] <agcolom> oh... 
[13:08:41] <_|Nix|_> s/and/and we/
[13:08:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, real invasive.
[13:09:05] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, we may just hook the new one up to a number input.
[13:09:09] <agcolom> ok, so in a way it'd make more sense to get a number input from the start...?
[13:09:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep.
[13:09:20] <agcolom> yes ;-)
[13:09:30] <agcolom> Thanks :-) I guess that answers my question :-)
[13:09:41] <agcolom> Thanks a lot and have a great evening :-)
[13:09:58] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I guess devs could manually replace all their range inputs and add a selector to the slider initSelector and they'd be on board for the new way.
[13:10:15] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: In fact, you may want to add that to the slider docs.
[13:10:54] <agcolom> yes, that's a possibility... 
[13:11:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: "If you want to prepare yourself for the future, replace your range inputs with number inputs and add a class or some other distinguishing thing to those number inputs you wish turned into sliders, and add that distinguishing thing to the slider widget's initSelector during mobileinit."
[13:11:34] <agcolom> Well, I suppose we can always add the new way to the 1.4 docs once we know what it is..
[13:11:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Real eloquent, aren't I?
[13:11:40] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:11:50] <agcolom> Wonderful ;-)
[13:12:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, yeah, but in the meantime, this should cover the transition period.
[13:12:54] <agcolom> I'm wondering whether this is not going to just raise more questions... 
[13:13:14] <agcolom> are we sure we're use number inputs?
[13:13:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, yeah ... I guess that's not entirely settled.
[13:13:55] <agcolom> ok, what I'll do is open an issue so we know we need ot add something...
[13:13:56] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The bottom line is though that people already have a lot of flexibility with initSelector and mobileinit.
[13:14:04] <agcolom> and we can add it when we know for sure...
[13:14:16] <agcolom> How does that sound?
[13:14:25] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sounds like a plan.
[13:14:35] <agcolom> excellent :-)
[13:14:57] <agcolom> Thanks all :-)
[13:26:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: NP!
[13:26:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got the per-swatch active state partially working.
[13:26:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/
[13:27:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, on swatch A it does not affect the active radio button in the horizontal controlgroup, and if you set a different active colour on swatch C it shows up on swatch A.
[13:27:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suspect this may something to do with the order of the rules in the default/starter theme ...
[13:27:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Have a look at the above URL, and tell me if you want me to push what I have.
[13:28:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You may be able to take the fix the rest of the way a lot faster than I.
[13:31:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another problem: Except for swatch a, when you hover over the active radio button in the horizontal controlgroup, the hover state is applied. However, in the demos, no hover state is applied to an active radio button in a horizontal controlgroup.
[13:32:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I'll push what I have because as it stands, all the pieces are in place except for the final glue.
