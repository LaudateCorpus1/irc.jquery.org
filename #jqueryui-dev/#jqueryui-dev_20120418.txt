[06:23:11] <jstroem> @gnarf: do you have any news to the pull 185?
[06:40:29] <gnarf> jstroem: not yet - gotta talk to scott_gonzalez about it once again
[06:41:01] <gnarf> I still think its pretty solid, it could probably use a rebase
[06:43:25] <gnarf> I still would like to see us land them
[06:43:37] <gnarf> dunno how scott feels about it
[06:43:47] <jstroem> yep. a rebase should be easily..
[06:44:53] <jstroem> i saw in the note on the the open pull requests that the following was needed: on hold, waiting for a big block of time to review new set of effects and would rather get existing code cleaned up first?
[06:45:13] <jstroem> are the other effect features cleaned?
[07:11:57] <gnarf> tbh - i've been so far from it in the last month or two that i can't say
[07:12:01] <gnarf> which means it probably isn't
[09:06:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: meeting?
[09:41:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what do you need from me to try getting any of these sites up and running?
[09:42:18] <gnarf> jq01.stage.jquery.com is now running all multi-site thanks to nacin
[09:42:31] <gnarf> you can fake out your /etc/hosts/ to get any of the sites
[09:43:20] <gnarf> nacin: btw, what did you have to say about stripping stage. from the front of the domain?
[09:43:28] <nacin> gnarf: yes, working on the stage.jquery.com aspect now. which DB should the staging site use?
[09:43:35] <gnarf> cuz if we could do that, we could get those staging envrionment setup
[09:43:51] <gnarf> nacin: so, there will eventually be another wordpress box just like this one, that isn't staging
[09:44:01] <gnarf> so for now, that machine is actually all the "staging" domains
[09:44:11] <nacin> got it
[09:44:20] <gnarf> but you might as well let it answer to the real domain too
[09:44:22] <nacin> they are in the format of stage.blog.jquery.com, yes?
[09:44:40] <gnarf> nacin: they do not currently exist, but that is the format that makes the most sense to me
[09:44:46] <gnarf> unless someone has an idea
[09:44:54] <gnarf> stage.api.jquery.com
[09:44:55] <gnarf> etc
[09:45:05] <nacin> personally, I would stick to /etc/hosts
[09:45:43] <gnarf> nacin: at some point we will probably setup the public domains
[09:45:43] <nacin> It plays nicer with WP (especially multisite). for your use case, it is probably plenty.
[09:46:05] <nacin> gnarf: you can do that too, but I wouldn't make those be the primary staging access point
[09:46:24] <gnarf> nacin: i kinda want to avoid having someone have to edit their /etc/hosts
[09:46:53] <gnarf> nacin: one less step for the "consumers" or "site-maintainers"
[09:47:31] <gnarf> whats the issue with stripping /^stage\./ from the HTTP_HOST header?
[09:47:45] <nacin> gnarf: fair points. URLs for individual sites live in the DB, so as long as staging is not using a live DB, then your setup is fine.
[09:48:03] <gnarf> nacin: ahhh yes
[09:48:05] <nacin> gnarf: we use live DBs in development so /etc/hosts is a much better solution
[09:48:10] <gnarf> nacin: the "base url"
[09:48:20] <gnarf> nacin: yeah, the stage has its own mysql too
[09:48:26] <nacin> so this is not a problem
[09:48:37] <nacin> citadel will deploy to both servers, yes?
[09:48:42] <gnarf> yes
[09:48:54] <nacin> puppet will have a flag for staging versus prod?
[09:49:14] <gnarf> and i can write a if ( $::environment == "stage" ) case
[09:49:17] <gnarf> yeah
[09:49:19] <gnarf> puppet knows
[09:49:39] <gnarf> end user code can probably know via environment variable
[09:49:48] <gnarf> i can write a setenv into the nginx config
[09:50:20] <nacin> or an http header
[09:50:40] <nacin> setenv sounds fine. WP will want to know as well, probably.
[09:50:52] <gnarf> nacin: whichever is easy
[09:51:06] <nacin> a JQUERY_STAGE constant in wp-config.php will make some things go smoothly.
[09:51:14] <gnarf> lets do that then
[09:51:16] <gnarf> define it now
[09:51:32] <gnarf> and then i can make the erb that generates it only include that in stage
[09:52:00] <nacin> okay. the assumption now is that the current mysql db is the staging db, yes?
[09:52:15] <gnarf> nacin: yes, that machine is a staging envrionment
[10:19:58] <nacin> gnarf: http://stage.jquery.com (when mapped to 205.186.144.58)
[10:20:22] <nacin> site is detected properly; all URLs are rewritten
[10:21:34] <gnarf> nacin: coo
[10:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I don't want any new effects until the existing ones are cleaned up.
[10:52:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: k
[10:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> Did you review that clip PR?
[10:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> err...I guess it wasn't a PR...

[14:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Am I missing something here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js#L677
[14:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't that just be self.currentItem.height() ?
[18:20:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: in menu, i am checking for ui-state-disabled to determine if selecting an element with click or enter is allowed. works with mouse and keyboard in visual test. trying to write a unit test. simulating the key event seems to do something weird and it's passing the ui-state-disabled check. ever seen anything like that?
[18:20:55] <kborchers> sorry for the novel
[18:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[18:21:54] <kborchers> really weird
[18:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> Could screenshare right now if you want.
[18:22:48] <kborchers> sure just a min let me find headphones
[18:24:40] <kborchers> ok, ready when you are
[19:06:52] <kborchers> I think i just entered the twilight zone ... unit tests pass in all non IE browsers and IE9 and ... IE6?!? IE7 and 8 fail ... i don't even
