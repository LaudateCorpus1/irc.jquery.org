[01:02:33] <WalterTamboer> When using sortable; Is it not allowed to manipulate the list with sortable items *after* started sorting?
[01:02:43] <WalterTamboer> Because I'm noticing some flickering
[01:02:52] <WalterTamboer> And sorting becomes impossible
[01:06:26] <WalterTamboer> Notice how dragging "Chapter 2" goes wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/4E2BR/1/ while it works correctly here: http://jsfiddle.net/4E2BR/
[09:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you unmute #jquery-meeting?
[09:06:41] <kborchers> nobody around that can unmute?
[09:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> seems that way
[09:07:53] <kborchers> i just asked in mobile
[13:42:17] <zeejy> Is anyone in here pretty familiar with the sortable code?
[13:43:07] <gnarf> zeejy: was lookin for some help tracing a bug in how it detects which sortable the dragged thing is hovering
[13:43:36] <gnarf> its kinda black magic to me, so i thought someone else might be more familiar
