[04:30:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer: let me know what you guys think about this http://gyazo.com/f1586d51def2b62887dba5ea08301f6e.png?1343042136 and this http://gyazo.com/c2bc1cc4473204178e1ff31c583c569a.png?1343042196 so far
[04:59:50] <agcolom> kborchers: just in case I'm allowed to give my opinion as well ;-)  I like the 1st one (a lot!). I'm not sure about the 2nd one (the four rows of dots looks a bit big, but maybe if it was thinner?).
[05:00:07] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #31: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/31/
[05:02:15] <kborchers> agcolom: your opinion is definitely welcome! i can easily slim it down, i was just going off of this mockup http://gyazo.com/8a973bea956589d5ea1e98bfea42cc8b.png?1343044594
[05:02:26] <kborchers> i probably need to make the dots less pronounced as well
[05:05:49] <agcolom> yes, I agree a divider is needed...  maybe if the dots are less pronounced as you say, it could work nicely...
[05:07:11] <kborchers> agcolom: thanks for the feedback :)
[05:08:37] <agcolom> you're welcome :-) I'm off to take the kids to see ice age 4! I'll check back later to see if there are more pretty pictures to comment on...
[05:37:20] <kborchers> here is the divider with less pronounced dots http://gyazo.com/ab5a73deefe0e0527a52c2bb1b83362a.png?1343046243
[05:37:26] <kborchers> i like that better, thanks agcolom

[06:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Looks good. Do we not have that image already in web-base-template?
[06:09:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure, i didn't look. i did that with css radial-gradients on the background of an hr and it just falls back to a grey if not supported.
[06:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[06:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> I would think there would be something in the repo already, since that's a common element across all sites.
[06:10:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, i'll look. just thought css would be cooler :P
[06:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I would be happy if that was the solution. I just want to make sure we only have one solution in web-base-template.
[06:12:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, i'll look around for an image and might just remove it :)
[06:12:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also, i'll need some help finding where some of these classes get
[06:12:21] <kborchers> applied to elements
[06:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:13:00] <kborchers> i need to add another class to the page that lists the widgets, etc.
[06:13:46] <kborchers> right now, the class that puts the rounded edged grey background around each of those also puts it on the actual entry when you drill down too
[06:14:28] <gnarf> sorry, im using release coverage to test something
[06:15:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not sure if that rambling made sense but you can see here that the background is on the actual entry http://gyazo.com/9082cd6b1db484322d11836ae6a5f90d.png?1343049066
[06:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I got it.
[06:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: http://getcloudapp.com/ :-)
[06:21:15] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: does that work with screenshots or just files? i like being able to just drag over a section of the screen and it's instantly an image online
[06:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> both, you can set it up to autoupload screenshots.
[06:22:42] <kborchers> gotcha … i think i actually have it installed and ended up still using gyazo
[06:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2a1K1T3r0f3C
[06:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: You might find our new release script interesting. It uses shelljs: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js
[06:36:13] <ben_alman> whenever i see a queue management abstraction for running code sequentially it makes me really, really sad
[06:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[06:37:46] <ben_alman> because it's something the language should support with a proper syntax
[06:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's coming.
[06:38:18] <ben_alman> yes, maybe not to node.js though
[06:38:32] <ben_alman> but spidermonkey already has generators and yield
[06:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: Once it lands in v8, it'll be in node.
[06:39:30] <ben_alman> also see this https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/devel/docs/api_util.md#gruntutilcallbackify
[06:40:38] <ben_alman> basically, it returns a function that if called with more arguments than the original function's length, treates the last argument as a callback that receives the original function's return value
[06:40:40] <ben_alman> super simple
[06:41:53] <ben_alman> does your release.js work on windows too?
[06:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> It should, though I'm not concerned if it doesn't.
[06:42:32] <ben_alman> and what is exec?
[06:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> sync child process.
[06:42:54] <ben_alman> where is that from?
[06:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> shelljs, it's really clever: https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs/blob/master/shell.js#L1291
[06:43:21] <ben_alman> where does it get defined
[06:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> It reads and writes to a dummy file to block :-)
[06:44:21] <ben_alman> hmmn so it doesn't actually test to see if its random file doesn't already exist
[06:44:21] <ben_alman> yay
[06:44:23] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #33: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/33/
[06:44:58] <ben_alman> wow, i'd love to use something like shelljs in grunt
[06:45:01] <ben_alman> that'd be great
[06:46:33] <ben_alman> maybe i'll do that for 0.5
[06:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's been pretty good to work with.
[06:47:00] <ben_alman> any issues?
[06:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> Two things I ran into.
[06:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> If you use the shelljs binary, it kills stdin.
[06:47:31] <ben_alman> so that wouldn't be an issue for me
[06:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> That wouldn't be an issue for grount through.
[06:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> The other is that echo( "- hi" ) outputs an empty line.
[06:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> I the string starts with a dash, then shelljs thinks it's an flag.
[06:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes sense for the other methods, but not for echo().
[06:48:23] <ben_alman> what if you do echo("-- - hi")
[06:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> same thing
[06:48:33] <ben_alman> ok
[06:48:53] <ben_alman> a common thing in unix is -- tells a program to stop processing flags
[06:48:59] <ben_alman> so it might be a nice feature to add
[06:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> He has an abstraction for unix features: https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs/blob/master/shell.js#L1021
[06:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> Notice line 1035.
[06:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> That probably also wouldn't affect grunt though, since you'd probably just continue doing your existing logging.
[06:50:32] <ben_alman> yea

[07:35:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how would you feel about splitting "Release Coverage" into 3 jobs?
[07:35:31] <gnarf> git / 1.7 / 1.6
[07:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Seems fine to me. jzaefferer thoughts?
[08:08:37] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #35: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/35/
[08:23:42] <agcolom> kborchers: thanks yes, that's definitely better! I'm still wondering... could we try with just 3 rows and 2 rows instead of 4? (unless this is a standard that is used elsewhere...) I am thinking 3 might be ideal... just an idea if it's not too difficult... and if you have time...
[08:25:26] <kborchers> agcolom: i can try that … it's actually a pixel height on the hr so it's not necessarily 4 rows but i can play with it to get 3
[08:29:13] <agcolom> ok, great, thanks! so it is all in css then?
[08:29:26] <kborchers> agcolom: yep :)
[08:30:23] <kborchers> agcolom: it's just a grey bar if the browser doesn't support radial-gradient
[08:31:38] <agcolom> kborchers: excellent! That's a really good idea.

[13:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ping
[13:06:56] <ajpiano> hey there
[13:06:59] <ajpiano> on a call, whats up
[13:07:17] <ajpiano> if you're going to ask about plugins site docs, the answer is i didn't do them yet >:)
[13:07:28] <ajpiano> got sidetracked with this syntax highligting stuff, etc.
[13:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, It's related, but not that :-P
[13:07:44] <ajpiano> sup
[13:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> We were going to have the docs at the root, right alongside the plugins.
[13:08:00] <ajpiano> ok
[13:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> That was going to be safe because plugin names were required to start with "jquery."
[13:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> But now that we've dropped the prefix, we need to create a directory for the docs.
[13:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> Do you think we should go with /docs/, /about/, or something else?
[13:09:29] <ajpiano> docs would be good, /help/ or /how-to/ might also make sense
[13:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've already got it using /docs/ locally. I'll stick with that unless you have a strong desire for something else.
[13:15:08] <ajpiano> i think docs is probably the best
[13:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[16:53:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i dunno why the failures started
