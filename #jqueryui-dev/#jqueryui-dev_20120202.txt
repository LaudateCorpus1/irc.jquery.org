[00:31:14] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer: here is the testswarm-browserstack integration code https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack
[01:29:40] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: nice!
[01:30:46] <jzaefferer> now just need a bit of documentation or do a walkthrough...
[05:31:35] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, yt?
[06:41:21] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, now maybe yes?
[06:46:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: yay
[06:47:08] <kborchers> clarkbox: nice!
[06:54:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wow, that's a lot of whitespace mess huh? did not realize it was that bad. good way for that guy to get his name all over the project :P
[06:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[06:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we should be able to run `make whitespace` and get the same result, right?
[06:57:23] * kborchers is not a make expert
[06:57:36] <kborchers> but wouldn't that only fix the output, not what's in github
[06:57:43] <kborchers> his issue was with git warnings
[08:31:45] * scott_gonzalez should look at IRC after talking
[08:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I haven't looked at the Makefile that gnarf is working on. I was assuming `make whitespace` would modify your local checkout.
[08:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> Though it might not.
[08:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> We talked about not letting you do a build if there were BOMs.
[08:33:36] * kborchers reiterates he is not a make expert so that could be the case
[08:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'd make sense to have a way to modify your local checkout and have the full build fail if the checkout it's using has whitespace problems.
[08:33:55] <kborchers> yeah
[08:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really know anything about make either.
[08:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> For that matter, I don't really know anything about ant.
[08:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to our builds :-P
[08:35:35] <kborchers> same here
[08:35:50] <kborchers> ?eval hi5("scott_gonzalez","kborchers")
[08:35:50] <bot-t1> kborchers: "scott_gonzalez _o/\o_ kborchers"
[08:43:46] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/rRA3gg
[08:43:46] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Sortable: Fixed destroy to remove instance from element. Fixes #8094 - .sortable() after destroy does not work. - Scott González
[08:49:12] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #226: STILL FAILING in 5 min 18 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/226/
[08:49:13] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Sortable: Fixed destroy to remove instance from element. Fixes #8094 - .sortable() after destroy does not work.
[11:38:11] <clarkbox> gnarf: fyi i wont have time to fix view.jquery until this weekend
[11:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: got a minute to look at an easing problem?
[11:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, nevermind gnarf, it's a bug in the easing demo
[11:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...anyone know we effects core redefines swing to be easOutQuad?
[11:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> s/we/why/
[13:02:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah "make whitspace" does modify your local copy
[13:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:02:46] <gnarf> and easeOutQuad is swing isn't it?
[13:03:07] <gnarf> or maybe its because we change the "default" to be easeOutQuat?
[13:03:23] <gnarf> i really don't know on that one, i just kept whatever was there when I picked it p
[13:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> We change it. Core defines it as easeInOutQuad.
[13:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're probably slightly different.
[13:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> Core's implementation is based on cosine and π
[13:07:45] <gnarf> im pretty sure that was a complete copy of the easing plugin just dropped in there
[13:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it's easeInOutSine
[13:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's a copy of the easing plugin, which is a port of the ActionScript easings from Robert Penner.
[13:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> core's swing is easinInOutSine, which is pretty close to easeInOutQuad
[14:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Check out this demo: http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/easing_demo.html
[14:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> Choose an easing, then click somewhere in the blue box.
[14:00:54] <gnarf> nice
[15:57:22] <clarkbox> gnarf: i fixed view.jqueryui.com
[15:57:33] <clarkbox> this is what was wrong:
[15:57:35] <clarkbox> ##starting branch 1-8-stable
[15:57:35] <clarkbox>  fatal: Unable to create '/srv/git-sources/web-view-jquery-org/htdocs/reporoot/.git/index.lock': File exists.
[15:57:57] <clarkbox> rm index.lock and everything is good now
[15:58:21] <clarkbox> should i check for that message, and automagically "rm index.lock" ??
[15:58:28] <clarkbox> i cant think of any safe way to do that
[15:59:55] <clarkbox> fyi scott_gonzalez jzaefferer danheberden ^^^
[16:00:59] <danheberden> clarkbox that's interesting
[16:01:17] <danheberden> or just always rm index.lock
[16:01:48] <clarkbox> at the very least i should not continue if i get that message... otherwise it just clones the main branch into all the repos
[16:02:37] <danheberden> is the process running too often?
[16:02:41] <clarkbox> ya, always removing the lock could be problematic. if someone is on that server working with git at that time, things could get really messed up
[16:02:48] <danheberden> e.g. view gets triggered, still pulls, then gets triggered again?
[16:02:49] <clarkbox> i cant remember how often
[16:02:54] <clarkbox> 10 or 30 min i think
[16:02:54] <danheberden> that might be as simple as creating your own lock
[16:03:12] <danheberden> that's what the jquery git and ui git builds do
[16:03:36] <clarkbox> can git maintain two instances running at the same time on one box?
[16:03:41] <danheberden> after 5 failed attempts against the .lock file, it removes the lock file and tries again
[16:03:48] <danheberden> clarkbox, i don't think so
[16:03:53] <danheberden> it's all filesystem based
[16:03:57] <danheberden> so if you're moving blobs around
[16:04:05] <clarkbox> ya, 5 failed attempts sounds like a good idea
[16:04:28] <danheberden> is this on a cron or hook?
[16:04:32] <clarkbox> cron
[16:04:36] <danheberden> coo
[16:04:40] <clarkbox> hook might be better
[16:04:43] <clarkbox> tho more effort
[16:06:14] <clarkbox> k, ill put that on the TODO backburner... 1)dont continue if there is a lock. 2)remove lock after 5 fails
[16:06:36] <danheberden> clarkbox, how about creating an issue on the repo
[16:06:38] <danheberden> in github
[16:06:40] <clarkbox> sure
[16:11:33] <clarkbox> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/4
[16:11:34] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[16:20:59] <gnarf> clarkbox: danheberden: sounds like somone ran the update script as a different user
[16:21:27] <clarkbox> but the lock file would hav ebeen removed in that case...?
[16:21:45] <clarkbox> i think its because the git proc crashed while running maybe
[16:21:51] <clarkbox> or my script crashed maybe
[18:37:08] <georgestephanis> Anyone around?  I /think/ I may have found a bug in Slider, but I'm not certain (and figure it's probably user error and my just being too big of a dunce to see it) -- is there anyone I could talk to before filing a bug report?
[18:38:12] <georgestephanis> It /may/ have been addressed by ticket #5583 -- but I could easily be mistaken.
