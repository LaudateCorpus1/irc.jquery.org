[06:42:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that is strange
[06:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[06:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, interesting, it's the `GROUP BY component` that's killing it.
[06:50:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, i was thinking it was the combo of the group by and order by which can get messy together but haven't actually played with it
[06:50:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's so annoying that you can't use variables in a query, you have to use SQL to get variables.
[06:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> The GROUP BY alone causes the problem.
[06:51:26] <kborchers> hmm
[06:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, Trac does special grouping.
[06:51:47] <kborchers> thanks Trac!
[06:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> Got it!
[06:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> SELECT component AS __group__
[06:52:20] <scott_gonzalez> ORDER BY component, priority
[06:53:10] <kborchers> Trac: "Go ahead and right SQL, it's cool"  Us: "Thanks, Trac!"  Trac: "BTW, I'm going to eff with your query and it won't work the way you expect" Us: "Oh, thanks Trac?"
[06:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> pretty much
[06:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> But at least it's working now.
[07:12:32] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, miller has some pretty good points on http://blog.millermedeiros.com/jquery-wish-list/
[07:43:30] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov missing meeting today cause of company meeting -- why do they always put them on wednesdays at noon?! anywho I'll be doing more unit test work today and I'm guessing you guys will be around later today if anything anyway :)
[08:05:06] <cguy> Hi all!  Sorry if this has already been mentioned/discussed hereâ€¦ but the permalinks for themes on the themeroller are broken!
[08:07:39] <rxaviers> cguy, thanks, we're aware. For safety let me know the url you are trying to access and the error msg you're getting?
[08:11:56] <cguy> rxaviers: The url I'm trying to get is at http://goo.gl/4Br1G and I'm receiving lots of 500 from subsequent requests to http://download.jqueryui.com/themeroller/* urls
[08:13:37] <cguy> rxaviers: could be tricky to fix seeing as there appears to be no reference to the version number in the permalink
[08:13:42] <rxaviers> thks, we have this issue opened https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/82
[08:13:42] <b-ot> rxaviers, issue #82 by rxaviers (5d 15h ago): (RFC) 502 Bad Gateway on long urls
[08:13:53] <cguy> rxaviers: thanks for letting me now
[08:14:10] <rxaviers> hopefully will be fixed soon
[08:14:45] <cguy> great
[08:17:52] <rxaviers> mm although this seems to be another error
[08:25:32] <cguy> looks like some new parameters in 1.10 are being enforced?  see the 500 http://goo.gl/tuDSA reporting 'Error: No dimensions set for texture "glass" '
[08:25:48] <cguy> Mine is a 1.9.2 theme
[08:26:38] <cguy> Is there a legacy support themeroller link?
[08:29:12] <rxaviers> aha!
[08:29:30] <rxaviers> the thing is, something got in production before it should get
[08:29:40] <rxaviers> it's about the new image (icon/texture) generation
[08:30:24] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, tagging jqueryui.com put on production some partial image generation commits
[08:30:51] <cguy> is there a work around I can use?
[08:31:08] <rxaviers> I was waiting to address gateway error first, then push new image generation things.
[08:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: :-(
[08:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> Can you set a valid version for download builder and retag?
[08:31:39] <rxaviers> sure, I can do that.
[08:31:59] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[08:32:00] <rxaviers> or image generation seems stable now. Is it worth pushing now?
[08:32:13] <rxaviers> or test it better first on stage?
[08:33:15] <rxaviers> (a) finish to push new image generation stuff or (b) revert it on prod?
[08:34:18] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ^
[08:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> If it's breaking (even more) stuff right now, we need to fix production.
[08:35:58] <rxaviers> revert is safier. But, image generation seems stable now (if I finish pushing other commits to prod as well) 
[08:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> If it's stable, feel free to push it.
[08:37:07] <rxaviers> gnarf, ping
[08:37:09] <rxaviers> ok
[08:40:23] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I need gnarf confirmation if new IM is on prod. So, Im reverting it right now..
[08:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[09:22:25] <b-ot> rxaviers, Rafael Xavier de Souza (4h 14m ago): Make components querystring shorter by using flags mask (BROKEN COMMIT, WIP YET ...)
[09:27:05] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, thanks. Not really a bitmask, just a string of ones and zeros. But that's probably the sanest approach here. I did the same a long time ago to store open/closed tree state in cookies in my treeview plugin: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-treeview/blob/master/jquery.treeview.js#L168
[09:29:15] <rxaviers> yeap, not bitmask. It can be improved to bitmask later if needed; http://irc.jquery.org/%23jqueryui-dev/%23jqueryui-dev_20130122.log.html#t05:27:32
[10:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> I love the memomail emails I get with my old tweets about WHATWG mailing list posts.
[10:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> Like this one with Hixie English: http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2012-January/034478.html
[10:31:28] <Dave_Stein2> scott_gonzalez: Considering 2.0 is gonna be mobile friendly... do you do any coordination with jquery-mobile?
[10:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, they're supposed to be looking at the interactions branch.
[10:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> Who knows if/when that will happen.
[10:33:06] <Dave_Stein2> i see their IRC channel is invite-only, but now that I'm Adobe I'm reaching out to a few of them and will probably meet them at the Adobe summit next week
[10:34:00] <Dave_Stein2> there are 3 devs that I know of, not counting anyone who might work on it part-time that are also in PhoneGap
[10:35:15] <Dave_Stein2> scott_gonzalez is there anything specific that we want to ask them aside from just a general lookover?
[10:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein2: It's not invite only; you're trying to go to the wrong channel.
[10:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's #jquerymobile-dev
[10:35:52] <Dave_Stein2> ef i just noticed i have a 2 
[10:36:01] <Dave_Stein2> probably from switching on and off VPN ... brb
[10:36:46] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez an im back
[10:37:38] <Dave_Stein> and you are obviously correct about channel
[10:37:48] <Dave_Stein> :)
[10:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing specific to ask them.
[10:39:13] <Dave_Stein> ok well it will still be cool for me to meet some more jquery people while im over there
[10:39:22] <Dave_Stein> im such a newbie ;)
[10:53:22] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez well all that aside, unit tests for me later today.... no other updates right?

[11:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: How did you end up with a merge commit from that?
[11:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> Did you use the big green button?
[11:56:19] <petersendidit> Yea didn't realize that the "Big Green button" would result in that.  Sorry
[11:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, GitHub also creates merge commits.
[11:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> We usually do everything we can to avoid them :-P
[11:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> So now you know.
[11:57:27] <petersendidit> ;-)
[11:57:40] <tj_vantoll> Does the big green button have a confirmation dialog after you click it?
[11:57:50] <tj_vantoll> Just for my own curiousity.
[11:58:00] <petersendidit> Yes it does
[11:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I think so. I think it prompts you for the commit message of the merge commit.
[11:58:29] <tj_vantoll> That's good.  The thing looks so damn clickable.
[11:58:34] <petersendidit> Which it pre populates with somethign that looks really close to your original commit message
[12:00:12] <petersendidit> Yes it does look very clickable. It calls out to be clicked.
[12:03:05] <tj_vantoll> So instead of pushing the big green button you would simply push the commit from your fork to the main repo?
[12:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull%20Requests
[12:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> That page is so long.
[12:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> For fixes from you, yeah, just push from your fork to the main repo.
[12:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> If you're landing someone else's PR, you'll need to make sure they have a proper name and email address in their commit info and that the've signed the CLA.
[12:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> And you may need to edit their commit message or clean up the code.
[12:08:46] <rxaviers> brb

[14:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: We may not have annotated our options yet.
[14:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> But it's just a matter of using an added/deprecated/removed attribute or element.
[14:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> It supports both attributes and elements for all cases.
[14:25:21] <agcolom> ah yes, that's what I need...

[14:45:41] <rxaviers> Ie. we should still hit the same error.
[14:46:28] <rxaviers> We definitely need to address te server/proxy/gateway config. On stage it works, but on production it may hit the same problem.

[18:01:37] <kborchers> petersendidit: i can not think of any reason you would do that
[18:01:52] <petersendidit> Yea seems like really bad UX
[18:01:58] <kborchers> yeah
[20:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that is quite a strange UI.
[20:15:20] <kborchers> uh oh â€¦ i just saw we had a "shiny green button" pressed today :P
[20:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[21:41:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: did some review of the dialog test suite tonight. looks pretty good. need to add a few tests which i should be able to get to soon.
[21:42:31] <kborchers> i was wondering if this should be documented or if it was meant to stay undocumented https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L607-L610
[21:44:58] <kborchers> but other than a couple of little things, test coverage looks pretty good
