Drop qunit-junit plugin, not worth the trouble. Update release script to run grunt-prepare after npm-install.

[09:46:31] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: After merge I'm failing a buncha cursorAt tests but I think they are invalid. It seems the current UI allows for an array but it doesn't say that in current API unless I'm misreading somehow
[09:47:16] <mikesherov> a bunch of them? Or one of them?
[09:47:29] <Dave_Stein> well one thing in a loop that causes 4
[09:47:30] <mikesherov> the only one that should fail is [ 10, 20 ]
[09:47:32] <Dave_Stein> was about to commit them out
[09:47:35] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[09:48:00] <mikesherov> what's the documentation say?
[09:48:10] <Dave_Stein> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-cursorAt
[09:48:13] <Dave_Stein> that it shouldnt even be there
[09:48:34] <mikesherov> so, it *works* in the old API
[09:48:39] <Dave_Stein> spoke with scott_gonzalez yesterday about another weird thing and he said remove if its not there
[09:48:53] <mikesherov> OK.
[09:48:57] <Dave_Stein> i forgot which option offhand, but it accepted functions that returned true and false but it wasnt in API so we removed
[09:49:27] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: OK, can you keep a summary of the changes you make to the test suite, so I can echo them in master
[09:49:43] <mikesherov> I'd like to proactively remove tests from master ahead of your rewrite
[09:49:45] <Dave_Stein> where at? just in a google doc?
[09:50:28] <mikesherov> yeah, actually, I suppose I can do it myself with `git log /tests/unit/draggable`

[09:50:43] <Dave_Stein> as far as I know the only tests I removed are this one... and the other I'll go dig up right now
[09:50:49] <mikesherov> don't comment it out, remove it outright
[09:51:03] <mikesherov> the other thing is that fail for stopping the drag callback, right?
[09:51:42] <Dave_Stein> no that one is still up for discussion

[09:52:55] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: you have some htmllint errors by the way in your map demo
[09:53:11] <Dave_Stein> oh that isnt mine, that was there
[09:53:15] <Dave_Stein> the ampersand thing?
[09:53:49] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:53:57] <Dave_Stein> yeah meant to ask about that as i never touched that file
[09:54:05] <Dave_Stein> also for some reason at home htmllint is failing with "TypeError: Cannot call method 'spawn' of undefined" 
[09:54:08] <mikesherov> should probably just fix it though
[09:54:10] <Dave_Stein> i installed java tho
[09:54:25] <Dave_Stein> oh wtf i just checked my install and its 32 bit?
[09:54:27] <Dave_Stein> *sigh*
[09:54:56] <mikesherov> 6 fails left!
[09:55:07] <Dave_Stein> ill go reinstall java and fix the lint
[09:55:17] <Dave_Stein> and let me find the other unit change i made
[09:55:52] <mikesherov> K, awesomeâ€¦. I'm going to see how much code coverage we have in draggable
[09:56:12] <mikesherov> I think there's lots of untested stuff
[09:56:20] <Dave_Stein> it's gonna be depressing
[09:56:23] <Dave_Stein> im sure
[09:56:43] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/interactions/tests/unit/draggable/draggable_options.js :D
[09:56:53] <Dave_Stein> removed distance, addclasses
[09:57:15] <Dave_Stein> and also removed function callbacks from the cancel unit test that's the one i couldn't remember
[09:58:26] <Dave_Stein> easy to see since my face isn't there often ha
[10:00:55] <Dave_Stein> eff wasn't the java thing
[10:01:10] <Dave_Stein> DaveMethvin: You ever see the error Cannot call method 'spawn' of undefined when doing htmllint? didn't get that at my work comp
[10:02:15] <DaveMethvin> Dave_Stein: nope, i've gotten the CreateProcess one when java isn't installed but that one sounds like a problem with node itself
[10:02:18] <Dave_Stein> also mikesherov I'm not sure what create is supposed to be in draggable... in fact its in the wiki with nothing under it ha. do you have any idea?
[10:02:52] <Dave_Stein> DaveMethvin: Weird I'll try re-installing the module then
[10:03:47] <Dave_Stein> hmm no dice... my other modules are running fine
[10:04:25] <DaveMethvin> Dave_Stein: i would just grunt --force my way through it if that's the only problem
[10:04:48] <Dave_Stein> i tried that earlier but it seems fatal as nothing else prints after the stack
[10:04:57] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[10:05:10] <DaveMethvin> sounds like it's dying in grunt itself then
[10:05:35] <DaveMethvin> did jqueryui update to grunt 0.4? maybe there's some issue with that
[10:05:36] <Dave_Stein> ya i found an old ticket that no longer applies where they fixed a bug with similar message
[10:05:42] <DaveMethvin> let me try building ui here
[10:06:02] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-html/issues/6 oh that
[10:06:21] <Dave_Stein> for some reason i thought .4 would be old ;)
[10:06:40] <DaveMethvin> imma do an npm update before to be sure all the modules are updated too
[10:06:53] <Dave_Stein> kk
[10:07:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i die on the htmllint but it is from the CreateProcessW error since java isn't installed
[10:07:46] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov: Think I should check out our google doc API for droppable and start on those like we did with draggable?
[10:07:49] <DaveMethvin> if i --force through it all builds
[10:07:55] <Dave_Stein> yeah that's how it was at work
[10:07:58] <DaveMethvin> and it looks like ui is stil on grunt 0.3
[10:08:05] <DaveMethvin> at least on master
[10:08:05] <Dave_Stein> i literally just installed everything here yesterday
[10:09:05] <Dave_Stein> so many moving pieces 
[10:09:36] <DaveMethvin> if  you're lucky they move, these seem to need some grease :D
[10:10:13] <Dave_Stein> oi I'll have to figure it out later as delivery just arrived.. thx for giving it a try
[10:10:19] <DaveMethvin> kk
