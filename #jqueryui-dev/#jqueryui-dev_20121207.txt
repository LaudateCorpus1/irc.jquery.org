[02:52:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hi there!
[02:52:50] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, what's in the nginx logs?
[02:52:53] <rxaviers> (server logs)
[02:53:08] <jzaefferer> no idea
[02:54:03] <rxaviers> Can I get ssh access to that machine?
[02:54:11] <rxaviers> (so far I have access to swarm)
[03:12:03] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: you probably have access to the others, too
[03:12:05] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - git core build #242: STILL FAILING in 44 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20git%20core/242/
[03:12:08] <jzaefferer> do you get the deployment emails?
[03:12:16] <jzaefferer> try the hostnames given there
[03:12:36] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we don't have any docs answering this, do we? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13711127/how-to-extend-an-existing-jquery-ui-widget
[03:12:55] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: try `ssh jq02.stage.jquery.com`
[03:13:15] <rxaviers> permission denied
[03:13:16] <jzaefferer> if that works, you should have access to all the machines
[03:13:28] <jzaefferer> maybe you need to add your username?
[03:13:41] <rxaviers> I've added rxaviers (just like they did for swarm)
[03:14:07] <jzaefferer> okay
[03:17:03] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: dunno how to add access, will have to gnarf for that
[03:17:22] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I looked for nginx errors log on jq01, but that doesn't seem to have logs for stage
[03:19:32] <jzaefferer> Well, looking at your email, seems like you've got some stuff to work on for now
[03:20:13] <jzaefferer> ah, I see why the demos broke
[03:20:24] <jzaefferer> they use db's config.json, and we changed the format
[03:23:28] <rxaviers> (gnarf and ryanneufeld helped me on giving me access)
[03:23:38] <rxaviers> (previously, to swarm)
[03:24:40] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, demos uses download builder config.json?
[03:25:10] <jzaefferer> yeah :/
[03:26:20] <jzaefferer> fixed that, should be on stage soon

[04:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: That URL that has ffDefault%253DSegoe is double encoded.
[04:58:02] <rxaviers> themeParams keeps themeRoller querystring, that's why it gets double encoded in download builder querystring.

[05:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely length related.
[05:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> It dies at exactly 1934
[05:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, 1935. 1934 is the last one it handles.
[05:09:28] <rxaviers> Ok. But, did you see my even longer url that passes?
[05:09:42] <rxaviers> i'd like to double check what's in nginx logs
[05:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, that is strange.
[05:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> jzaeffere Krinkle|detached: swarm is broken.
[05:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ^ (damn typos)

[05:41:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well, if you need to be all fancy :P

[05:41:28] <kborchers> thanks :)
[05:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> I just created the 1-10 branch and pushed your changes and then ammended my changes.
[05:42:04] <kborchers> cool
[05:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> There's still one issue which is that the return type for value() is wrong now.
[05:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> It can also return a boolean.
[05:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't currently have a way to document multiple return types.
[05:42:32] <kborchers> oh yeah
[05:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think core just uses "Object" when that happens.
[05:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> Which isn't too useful.
[05:42:47] <kborchers> right
[05:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to wait for kswedberg to be around to discuss that.
[05:43:07] <kborchers> yep, maybe create an issue?

[05:46:13] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Regarding that draggable/sortable duplicate.
[05:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm always torn on this.
[05:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> One on hand, we could switch one of them to be filed against mouse, then close the other as a dup.
[05:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> On the other hand, it's confusing to users, especially when they see it in the changelog.
[05:47:33] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I see what you're saying.  Both interactions have the problem even though they have the same root cause.
[05:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> Another good example of this is http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5559
[05:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> That's really a dup of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4603
[05:48:09] <scott_gonzalez> But anyone hitting the dialog issue wouldn't know that it's fixed by reading the changelog if we closed it as a dup of the resizable bug.

[05:56:57] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, the toggleAll is quicker now. Although, still not as quick as I'd like it to be. I've put the toggleAll in a async mode (using a setTimeout fn). But, it gets even more noticable that it's slow: (a) now, you click, it works, it unchecks the components, then it unchecks the toggleAll. (b) on delayed mode, you click, it unchecks the toggleAll, it works, then it unchecks the components.
[05:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'll add it to my list of things to look at. The toggleAll should be really quick.
[05:58:45] <rxaviers> Maybe one more algorithm that could be improved is the dependency/dependents one.
[05:59:14] <rxaviers> but, profiling shall point us to the right direction.
[05:59:31] <rxaviers> Please, just let me know what you think. Im moving to another issue in the meanwhile.
[06:00:09] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, I think my ssh access wont be ready now. Is it possible for anyone to check the nginx logs for me and let me know what we get there when the long url fails? 
[06:00:32] <rxaviers> I think that's a good start before trying stuff out
[06:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[06:03:08] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Makes sense.  I agree with leaving #7941 open then, at least it has a comment now pointing at the underlying cause.
[06:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'm not a fan of most code metrics.
[06:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> But for the cyclomatic complexity of switch statements, what would you suggest for refactoring?
[06:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> For example, this is not actually complex: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L68
[06:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> I *HATE* refactoring code for tests or code metrics.

[06:34:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did you merge the dialog-updates into the 1-10 branch?
[06:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> not yet
[06:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually in the middle of hanging blinds :-P
[06:36:24] <jzaefferer> nice
[06:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog docs are the next thing on my list though.
[06:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> So that'll be done this morning.
[07:05:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any objection to adding the appendTo to dialog? regarding http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7948
[07:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[07:08:17] <jzaefferer> the ui-front rules don't apply here, so default should be "body"?
[07:08:30] <jzaefferer> or document.body?
[07:09:03] <jzaefferer> this.document.find( this.options.appendTo )?
[07:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> "body"
[07:10:16] <jzaefferer> .appendTo( this.document.find( this.options.appendTo ) );
[07:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> See autocomplete's _appendTo() method.
[07:11:01] <jzaefferer> clone that?
[07:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:11:26] <jzaefferer> why does _setOption not use _appendTo?
[07:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> Good catch, I missed that when I wrote _appendTo().
[07:11:47] <jzaefferer> oversight?
[07:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> I can fix that and add a test.
[07:12:38] <jzaefferer> well, in that case, you might as well add the dialog option
[07:12:42] <jzaefferer> I'll look at selectmenu now
[07:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:13:27] <jzaefferer> The remaining dialog tickets are about effects or rather obscure bugs
[07:13:49] <jzaefferer> I'd like to get that down to 0, too, but nothing blocking the beta release

[07:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> But you have 60 days to get your license.
[07:43:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez gnarf rworth: okay to have the biweekly testing meeting an hour earlier? That way Krinkle could join. Can't have it later, as those slots are blocked, and I'd like to keep it on Thursdays.
[07:43:57] <jzaefferer> sidenote: EST means both Eastern Standard Time and European Summer Time. Timezones sucks!
[07:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[07:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: EST is likely the wrong thing to list anyway. Use ET.
[07:45:45] <Krinkle> please don'y
[07:45:47] <jzaefferer> So 11am ET?
[07:45:58] <jzaefferer> No?

[07:46:22] <Krinkle> UTC seems somewhat universal, though there's been a war about that too
[07:46:34] <jzaefferer> are we on GMT+1 or +2 now?
[07:46:38] <Krinkle> +1
[07:46:52] <Krinkle> the time is okay, just commenting about the timezone indication
[07:47:20] <Krinkle> I don't think a 2 letter abbreviation looks associated to a timezone (usually 3 or 4 characters)
[07:47:45] <Krinkle> oh well, GMT, UTC, CEST, UCT (French), UTC (English), CET, PDT
[07:47:54] <Krinkle> I'll use Google Calendar time
[07:48:04] <Krinkle> GCT :)
[07:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I've been using ET for several years and have never had anyone get confused.
[07:52:10] <Krinkle> There's a first time for everything.
[07:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> I won't use that as a reason to stop :-)

[08:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers gnarf mikesherov: I want to stop duplicating widget APIs on the planning wiki.
[08:31:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: go for it
[08:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think we should continue to document things like how we handle accessibility, or why we do (or don't do) something.
[08:31:53] <mikesherov> existing API's, sure
[08:32:04] <mikesherov> but for the planned API's, the wiki is the only way
[08:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> But once a widget is released, there's no point in having the API on the planning wiki.
[08:32:12] <mikesherov> right?
[08:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: yup
[08:32:19] <mikesherov> good, makes sense
[08:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> Just like section 4 (makrup and style) is only used prior to release.
[08:32:32] <mikesherov> single source of truth
[08:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> Then as soon as we release, we delete it.
[08:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll go through the wiki and update appropriately.
[08:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll make sure that any notes included in the API docs are left in-tact on wiki.
[08:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you see my comment about thinking that mergeatron was kicking off tests too frequently?

[08:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[08:36:51] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: it kicks one off for every time a PR is submitted or new commits are added
[08:36:53] <Krinkle> Yes, that's due to  http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1774
[08:37:06] <Krinkle> a corrupt database entry, will investigate
[08:37:20] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: the other jobs are fine, if you folllow the job page from jenkins jobs directly its fine
[08:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yesterday there were a lot of tests queued for the ajax-unit PR.
[08:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> And there were no new commits.
[08:38:36] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: link?
[08:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I'm not sure how to get to that data now.
[08:39:47] <mikesherov> which PR?
[08:41:22] <Krinkle> mikesherov: the one from ajax-unit to master or from Krinkle/ajax-unit-fix to ajax-unit?
[08:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1060
[08:41:45] <Krinkle> because the latter one I pushed amendments too quite often yesterday (about 10 easily)
[08:41:53] <Krinkle> yep, that's the one
[08:41:58] <mikesherov> so that's why
[08:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub says you didn't touch it yesterday.
[08:42:23] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: [citation needed]
[08:42:27] <mikesherov> well, you can lie and push rebased code
[08:42:27] <Krinkle> where do you base that off?
[08:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1060#commits-pushed-d5b6ff3
[08:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> Where you force pushing?
[08:43:00] <Krinkle> if you push an ammended commit, it replaces the one
[08:43:10] <mikesherov> that's a good point, we should make mergeatron throttle.
[08:43:29] <Krinkle> mikesherov: you could do an origin check once a job has its turn
[08:43:47] <mikesherov> Krinkle: yup
[08:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so this is just GitHub not showing the actual history because the commit still has the old timestamp?
[08:43:53] <Krinkle> so the job is queued in jenkins for a while, and once it is on turn, check that it is still needed, if not, drop it.
[08:44:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: if you --force a push, it's as if it never happened :-)
[08:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but the timestamp still says 2 days ago.
[08:44:44] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: No, I amend my PR, the original commits are in my repo but no longer in the history of that branch. They can be seen if a comment was made on it but the "commits" list will never show the outdated ones.
[08:45:12] <Krinkle> Yes, I could've updated the timestamp, but I didn't. That wouldn't make a difference though. timestamps aren't used.
[08:45:22] <Krinkle> push-time is used by github to show them in the pull request thread.
[08:45:45] <Krinkle> commit time is used in the commit label, in the UI
[08:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> Right, my point is that it was impossible for me to see that you were committing.
[08:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> So I thought mergeatron was sending unnecessary tests.

[08:55:05] <Krinkle> mikesherov: that issue has a short description, so I won't pick on the contents, but do you mean abort the queue or abort job popped from the queue
[08:55:17] <Krinkle> difference of prioritizing the old commit vs. the latest commit
[08:55:25] <Krinkle> probably better to drop the old instead of blocking the new
[08:55:32] <mikesherov> Krinkle: add details :-)
[08:55:50] <Krinkle> not literally removing it from the queue, but on run-time cancel if there is a newer one for this pull.

[09:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...you used inline styles instead of a class?
[09:13:25] <agcolom> yes, just to try

[09:16:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: have to take my daughter to her guitar lesson... will be there in 15/20 mins. I can usually connect to the internet while there but cannot garantee 100%... will let you know if I do, if you want to discuss the style...

[09:39:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I'm at the lesson and I have an internet connection
[09:42:04] <agcolom> I've just realised this is probably right in your lunchtime? We can discuss this later if that's easier for you...
[09:51:57] <_zoggy_> have a question for you jquery ui people that are smarter than i..
[09:54:28] <_zoggy_> i have a jui dialog, that we call to show a user directory so they can select a folder.. 
[09:54:31] <_zoggy_> https://raw.github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard/12a6c733d3b4a7d21c03d0bd44c40d76eb26061d/data/js/browser.js
[09:54:59] <_zoggy_> the callback on that doesnt work right since i moved the button declare into the actual dialog initlaize
[09:55:25] <_zoggy_> if i define the buttons like this, it works fine
[09:55:26] <_zoggy_> https://raw.github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard/a863705abbaf624ca549610e3a2988df8106c7bb/data/js/browser.js
[09:56:12] <_zoggy_> what is the real difference from doing fileBrowserDialog.dialog('option', 'buttons', { method vs doing
[09:56:35] <_zoggy_> buttons: [ { click
[10:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: There shouldn't be a difference. What behavior are you seeing with the one that doesn't work right?
[10:35:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf mikesherov (slacker petro): Would be great if someone could look at this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8867
[10:38:42] <_zoggy_> scott_gonzalez, i figured it out.. its because i just needed to extend the options before i added the buttons in the initalize way
[10:39:09] <_zoggy_> because i guess if you 'append' the callbacks after initialization it was taking in my extend options before it added the callbacks.. thus they were included
[10:39:15] <_zoggy_> so just had to move some code around

[10:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why they would behave differently though. Could you put together a fiddle showing what's happening?

[10:45:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: kinda
[10:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> For dialog's appendTo option, we should ignore that for the overlay, right?
[10:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> We always append the overlay to the body.
[10:54:21] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ^
[10:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, had to step away for a few minutes right after I pinged you.
[11:04:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: sounds reasonable, yeah. Need to test that though
[11:04:17] <jzaefferer> Might be the wrong behaviour
[11:04:20] <jzaefferer> ttyl
[11:39:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you want to talk about the yellow box?
[11:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Sure, all I have to say is that it should use a class :-P
[11:40:49] <agcolom> oh yes, totally! 
[11:41:06] <agcolom> how about warning as class name?
[11:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose you wouldn't have been able to do that easily without web-base-template and a local server setup.
[11:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine with me.
[11:41:40] <agcolom> and does the color work well with your color scheme?
[11:53:39] <agcolom> (and how do you want to proceed?)
[11:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> yup

[11:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I can add it if you don't have a local setup yet.
[11:56:09] <agcolom> yes please ;-) (I'm totally dead this evening!)
[11:56:44] <agcolom> (and I still have 2 car journeys to do!)
[12:06:07] <_zoggy_> ok man this is bizarro, guess it wasnt the js, just bug in 1.7.2
[12:06:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: btw, there's still something I haven't got (in the signature class I think) so I don't get the colored background for methods http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.changePage/
[12:06:14] <_zoggy_> tried upgrading to 1.8.3 and problem went away
[12:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: Well that's good news :-)
[12:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> Also, WTF are you doing on 1.7.2 :-P
[12:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, you mean jQuery 1.7.2?
[12:07:21] <_zoggy_> yes
[12:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that's acceptable.
[12:07:37] <_zoggy_> i was scared to upgrade to 1.8.x due to the changes/bugs/etc
[12:08:10] <_zoggy_> i got burned badly on the 1.6.x attr/prop thing
[12:08:17] <DaveMethvin> BUGS? We removed them all :P
[12:08:26] <_zoggy_> so im always scared to upgrade to the next major version
[12:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The style issues won't be addressed until we're on the new-css branch.
[12:09:52] <agcolom> oh, that's fine. so that will take care of both things? 
[12:11:23] <_zoggy_> ok take that back, problem still happening on 1.8.3 :( theres gotta be some variable leaking thing going on thats killing it :/
[12:12:10] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you know roughly when the new-css branch will be used? (might it be before the end of year?)
[12:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: it should be
[12:13:44] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: brilliant! Thank you!
[12:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is this valid? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8252
[12:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> The relevant part being: $('#a')[0].selectedIndex = -1;
[12:31:47] <DaveMethvin> i've seen a similar ticket recently let me find it
[12:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> While browsers do support that, it seems wrong.
[12:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> If you set a legit value, the bug doesn't occur.
[12:35:27] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i don't see a specific bug, i was thinking of another bug
[12:35:39] <DaveMethvin> i think the behavior of -1 is browser defined
[12:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> The bug is that if you set to -1 and then wrap, you lose the -1
[12:36:16] <DaveMethvin> oh then that IS the clone issue i suppose
[12:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> But if you set to a *real* value, the bug doesn't occur
[12:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm inclined to close as wontfix.
[12:36:52] <tj_vantoll> I've used selectedIndex = â1 before.  I believe it's cross browser friendly.
[12:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> I can point to the clone bug if you can find i.t
[12:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Seems like a bad thing to do.
[12:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> Selects and radios should always have a value.
[12:37:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it probably isn't a clone in particular but it's like the issue where check boxes get unchecked on re-append
[12:37:29] <tj_vantoll> If you want to force a choice.
[12:37:40] <tj_vantoll> <select>s work with the required attribute.
[12:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> But you can't have selectedIndex = -1 on page load with markup, right?
[12:38:24] <tj_vantoll> No
[12:38:24] <DaveMethvin> YEAH so there!
[12:38:34] <scott_gonzalez> Does required work off of selectedIndex or the value associated with the selected option?
[12:38:36] <DaveMethvin> it must be sanity checking the value on re-append
[12:38:49] <tj_vantoll> *testing*
[12:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> Like <option value="">Select an option</option>
[12:39:12] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9997 closest i can find, but not quite the issue here
[12:39:44] <tj_vantoll> I will work with an empty value http://jsfiddle.net/qTZtd/
[12:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not quite the same.
[12:39:50] <tj_vantoll> *It will*
[12:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that seems like the correct way to do what you're doing with -1.
[12:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> Also, Chrome's validation is pretty slick.
[12:40:46] <tj_vantoll> I agree.  I'm just saying that it does work because I've done it in the past.
[12:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'm going to close this ticket.

[12:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> Using -1 puts you in a gray area.
[13:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...thoughts on whether resizable min/maxHeight/Width should include padding and/or border
[13:16:38] <tj_vantoll> Does core's height()?
[13:16:46] <tj_vantoll> or width()
[13:19:22] <tj_vantoll> I would probably say yes.  It looks like resizable uses outerHeight / outerWidth so I'm assuming it already does include padding/border?
[13:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> No, resizable uses just the content height.
[13:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> It excludes padding and border.
[13:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like it should be included though.
[13:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> height() and width() in core are also content height.
[13:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> If you want padding, you use .innerHeight()
[13:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> and if you want border, you use .outerHeight().
[13:33:16] <tj_vantoll> Thanks.  And yeah, from the APIs I would expect them to be included as that is what you would almost always want.  Resizables almost always have borders so I'm surprised this hasn't come up before.
[13:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> me too
[13:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> I just noticed it while working on dialog.
[13:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, why is CSS such a mess?
[13:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> deafult for min-height is auto, but default for max-height is none.
[13:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome doesn't seem to understand minHeight: "auto"
