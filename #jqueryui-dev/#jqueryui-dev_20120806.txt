[05:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers jzaefferer: Thanks for working on some fo those API issues over the weekend.
[05:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> i'll be in the car all day today driving back home, but I'll be working on cleaning up the XML files again.
[05:12:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: np … i had to reopen that one issue. it's going to be a little more complicated than i thought to move the disabled option and create event to inherits
[05:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I already re-closed it :-P
[05:13:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i see … ok, then the create event should be pretty easy to knock out soon too
[05:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's what I figured.
