[14:48:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: *sigh* ... I truly don't understand what could possibly be different from jQuery 1.x that should cause redirect tests to fail so reliably.
[14:48:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its happening on ALL jquery versions
[14:49:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Nono. It started happening since we placed jquery 2.1.3 into external/jquery/jquery.js
[14:49:14] <gabriel_schulhof> That's what's so super-weird.
[14:49:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its now on all versions though
[14:49:40] <arschmitz> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/57394350
[14:50:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can I try something super-crazy? I'd like to replace external/jquery/jquery.js on 1.5-test-cleanup with the version on master. Let's see if, as a result, the redirect tests still fail.
[14:51:05] <arschmitz> sure
[14:51:15] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll push in a sec.
[14:51:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: check out the grunt file on that branch lol
[14:53:39] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 061.5-test-cleanup: 02http://git.io/veuwi

[14:53:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Wow! Nice!
[14:54:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that also does the seperate build and demos tests
[14:55:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also caches the node_modules so npm install takes no real time
[14:56:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also we need to build the js on every run we DO use it all over the place
[14:57:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Weird that I couldn't find the word "dist" in any of the tests, since you've found it in so many ...
[14:57:22] <arschmitz> its not there
[14:57:26] <arschmitz> its ../../../js
[14:57:40] <arschmitz> which is replaced in the connect custom middleware
[14:57:43] <gabriel_schulhof> Right!
[14:57:51] <arschmitz> with a dynamicly generated path to dist
[14:58:09] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so whenever we include js/ we're actually including the dist.
[14:58:19] <arschmitz> and some of it is non trivial to replace with amd
[14:58:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Makes sense - after all, connect doesn't do PHP.
[14:58:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there is grunt php already there too though
[14:58:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Neah ... we should move away from requiring server-side tools.
[14:58:56] <arschmitz> but anyway i have it just build the js thats fast
[14:59:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, exactly ... no need to build the .min.js
[14:59:26] <arschmitz> because some of it just explodes with require
[14:59:35] <arschmitz> thats not what takes time
[14:59:43] <arschmitz> its building the css and demos
[15:00:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's actually bad that it explodes with require. Might mean we still have load order deps.
[15:00:23] <arschmitz> no its like base tests
[15:00:35] <arschmitz> so the paths just explode when you mess with the base
[15:01:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec ... shouldn't the library be fully loaded before you do any messing?
[15:01:20] <gabriel_schulhof> But anyway - lots to look at, is what that's telling me.
[15:01:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/navigation/base-tests.html#L15
[15:02:27] <arschmitz> that test is so broken though it links to a bunch of stuff that does not exist
[15:02:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Ugh
[15:03:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: on the bright side i got test time down by 66%
[15:03:29] <arschmitz> on travis
[15:04:20] <gabriel_schulhof> That's awesome!
[15:05:32] <arschmitz> prior to the cacheing and a couple other things i tweaked i got the total combined time down from 150min -> 50 minutes
[15:05:48] <arschmitz> and the pr submit to report time down from 120min to 15min
[15:06:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Another thought: We're specifying in package.json that we want grunt-qunit-istanbul exactly at version 0.3.0. Maybe later versions bring later versions of phantomjs which can handle later versions of core better.
[15:07:15] <arschmitz> later versions of phantom your funny ...
[15:07:54] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, is grunt-qunit-istanbul@0.3.0 using the absolute latest available version?
[15:07:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: phantom has never upgraded its webkit version until 2.0 which is brand new i dont think most things support it yet
[15:08:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Is the networking and redirect bit also part of Webkit though?

[15:09:01] <arschmitz> but i know latest phantom is super broken
[15:09:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I'll be darned - 1.11.1 passed on that build!
[15:09:28] <arschmitz> spider.js uses it and it currupts it self on the global level requireing re-install regularly
[15:09:47] <gabriel_schulhof> *facepalm*
[15:09:52] <arschmitz> iv seen it happen on travis, jenkins and on scotts laptop
[15:09:55] <arschmitz> and my laptop
[15:10:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: git passed on too
[15:10:53] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, here goes nothing: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/57399829
[15:10:55] <arschmitz> but thats my build not yours
[15:11:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: A cosmic ray must've hit just the right bit in the RAM on the server with just the right energy.
[15:11:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: espically since that build is an empty commit lol
[15:12:00] <arschmitz> its actually a --allow-empty
[15:12:01] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh*
[15:12:15] <arschmitz> i was testing the cacheing
[15:12:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec - it caches across builds?
[15:12:49] <arschmitz> yes the node_modules directory
[15:12:53] <arschmitz> why not your computer does
[15:13:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, and sometimes I'm like "But it works on mine, how come it's broken on yours?"
[15:13:23] <arschmitz> yup
[15:13:27] <arschmitz> that happens
[15:13:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but it happens because we ran npm install at vastly different times.
[15:13:54] <arschmitz> yup
[15:14:00] <arschmitz> this runs npm install every time
[15:14:10] <arschmitz> it just does not delete the directory every time
[15:14:38] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so if one of our (indirect) dependencies gets a new version, it /will/ update, right?
[15:14:58] <arschmitz> yes
[15:15:18] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, that's good. I'd want to know of breakage introduced by a new version of <dependency>.
[15:15:21] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so yours is failing too
[15:15:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep
[15:16:00] <arschmitz> im going to remove those tests until this is figured out
[15:16:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Can I reset --hard that commit, or is it better to revert?
[15:16:05] <arschmitz> this is not helpful at this point
[15:16:15] <arschmitz> im going to rebase this anyway
[15:16:19] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[15:16:26] <arschmitz> i have empty commits and stuff
[15:16:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I think the sequence tests have already been helpful when dealing with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8051, so I've had my use of them for now.
[15:17:07] <arschmitz> im not saying all of them
[15:17:09] <arschmitz> just those 2
[15:17:21] <arschmitz> if they cant pass on CI they are not usefull
[15:17:54] <arschmitz> and they are both dialog tests
[15:17:59] <arschmitz> and dialog is deprecated
[15:18:05] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, path1-path2-dialog-hash-key was the crucial one for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8051, but yeah, go right ahead ... I can always resurrect them locally if I need to make sure that, as a result of a nav change, we're not breaking funky deep-linking URLs.
[15:18:09] <arschmitz> ( technically due for removal )
[15:18:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually, they're not just dialog tests. They're all kinds of sequence tests involving pages, dialogs, and popups.
[15:18:54] <gabriel_schulhof> ... but I added them mostly to make sure that our deep linking works correctly.
[15:19:21] <arschmitz> sequence-dialog-hash-key-tests.html is not dialog specific?
[15:19:26] <gabriel_schulhof> No.
[15:19:46] <gabriel_schulhof> dialog-hash-key refers to $.mobile.dialogHashKey, which is also used with popup to render a history item non-deep-linkable.
[15:20:01] <arschmitz> gotcha
[15:20:07] <arschmitz> either way im not removing them
[15:20:11] <arschmitz> just not going to run them
[15:20:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, but please make sure you can still run them with --suites=navigation/sequence/sequence-page1-page2-dialog-hash-key-tests.html
[15:20:57] <arschmitz> heck i could add in another environment variable and just disable on travis if you want?
[15:21:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Sweet!
[15:22:07] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You know what's funny? tests/integration/navigation/sequence/sequence-push-state-disabled-path1-path2-dialog-hash-key-tests.html never fails, even though it redirects to sequence-path1-path2-dialog-hash-key-tests.html after adding ?push-state=false to the search.
[15:22:32] <gabriel_schulhof> ... which in turn redirects to sequence-redirect.html, which is what seems to be failing in phantom.
[15:24:26] <arschmitz> yeah i dont get it
[15:24:29] <arschmitz> i cant figure it out
[15:25:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's a bug in phantomjs - pretty sure.
[15:25:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, if it were some JS exception at any point, it would fail differently.
[15:26:16] <gabriel_schulhof> ... though I wish I were more proficient at debugging phantomjs ...

[17:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> My hatred for phantom grows every day...
[17:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've lost track of how many times I've had to reinstall it just to make it work.
[17:38:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i hear you
[17:38:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: should look into making spider.js work with slimer.js again 
[17:39:25] <arschmitz> it SHOULD be one line to make it work but iv never had luck in the past and i skipped dealing with it for V1
[17:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't understand how it breaks itself.
[17:40:19] <arschmitz> i dont either
[17:40:31] <arschmitz> and i mean full global breakage needing re-install
[17:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-contrib-qunit actually gets a local breakage.
[17:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder what's different about that and spider.js.
[17:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> Same exact error output.
[17:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> But it's local instead of global.
[17:42:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and it breaks too though?
[17:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:42:55] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2015-April/081467.html
[17:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> Same exact breakage.
[17:43:02] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Happily switched to Karma
[17:43:14] <Krinkle> Took a few months but now we're fully switched
[17:43:16] <Krinkle> using Chromium
[17:43:21] <Krinkle> instead of PhantomJS
[17:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> ohhhhh
[17:43:48] <Krinkle> Best thing I did past year in our CI stack at Wikimedia
[17:43:51] <Krinkle> 5x faster
[17:44:05] <Krinkle> and nicer code coverage and so much more
[17:44:14] <arschmitz> Krinkle: we are looking at intern for mobile
[17:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, tests are all updated. Now I just need someone to review the qunit-composite PR so I can rebase on top of that.
