[01:39:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NM. I need re-work the checkboxradio. The relationship between checked, unchecked, show icon, and don't show icon doesn't work.
[01:39:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey!
[01:40:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6437 when I realized that setOptions doesn't work properly either.
[01:40:01] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6437 by gabrielschulhof (4w 1d ago): Dynamically created horizontal controlgroup does not properly initialize child checkboxes
[01:40:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mean it's broken in the widget?
[01:40:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[01:40:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[01:40:12] <uGoMobi> aii
[01:40:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's really hard to keep all the state in mind.
[01:40:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I need to sit down and work through it.
[01:40:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did I broke it when changing it to only add state class?
[01:41:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, we were checking in several different places whether the checkboxradio is inside a controlgroup, and each check was different.
[01:41:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No.
[01:41:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It was already broken.
[01:41:14] <uGoMobi> I see
[01:41:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking that I'll do a test-first approach. We really need to test these state changes.
[01:41:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good idea
[01:42:58] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll try to get it done before the weekend and, if not, before next week.
[01:43:43] <uGoMobi> cool, thanks!

[06:31:30] <horse> i wonder if someone can point my in the correct direction.  i have a page with a button on which when clicked launches a modal
[06:31:42] <horse> the modal contains a html form, lots of code.
[06:32:18] <horse> i would like to split the code for the modal from my main page, but still have a button on the main page which calls it. is this possible?
[06:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> horse: Support is in #jquery.
[06:33:55] <horse> ah sorrty
[06:33:56] <horse> sorry
[06:34:03] <horse> i did try there already.
[06:35:01] <horse> dont suppose you have any idea do you scotty?
[06:43:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: pong
[06:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> What do you think about simplifying the dialog focus logic to match HTML modal dialogs?
[06:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> If there's an autofocus element, use that, otherwise use the dialog.
[06:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> No first tabbable logic.
[06:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> I started writing an email about why the HTML spec should change, and after I laid out what we had gone through the past 5 years and what the proposal was, I realized that the HTML spec is actually pretty nice.
[06:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> Other than the fact that it says non-modal dialogs shouldn't get focus on open.
[06:45:36] <jzaefferer> As far as I remember from my screenreader testing, focusing the dialog is the worst thing that can happen. For example, in NVDA the dialog forces forms mode, so focusing a non-form element sucks.
[06:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> We won't follow that part.
[06:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, hmm...
[06:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is this just an NVDA issue?
[06:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> We should make a simple test page and test in all the AT we care about.
[06:56:49] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to removing the tabs at bottom demo?
[06:57:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's bad for accessibility, since you go through the entire panel before getting to the tabs.
[07:05:04] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers ^
[07:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you use tabs at the bottom for Mobile? Or are footers implemented differently?
[07:06:13] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: tabs like the tabs widget you mean?
[07:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:06:25] <kborchers> +1 to remove it
[07:06:44] <arschmitz> i have a demo of doing that but its nothing that is really used
[07:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> So footers with buttons for differnet pages are usually implemented some other way?
[07:07:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: generally when people do footers they are buttons to other pages
[07:07:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: keep in mind, if you want me to bring any of this to the accessibility summit next week before making a decision, i can
[07:07:16] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[07:07:33] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: tabs is new in 1.4 and its just the stand alone widget
[07:07:43] <arschmitz> its not used internally by anything else
[07:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Oh, yeah, let's get a discussion about dialog focus at the summit :-)
[07:08:00] <kborchers> will do
[07:08:13] <arschmitz> so removing bottom tabs is fine
[07:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait for jzaefferer to respond just to make sure.
[07:08:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i could even skype you in or what ever if you want
[07:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually going to make the widget support it better, but remove the demo :-P
[07:09:27] <arschmitz> cool

[07:31:39] <kborchers> not sure who fixed it but hope they tried to collect more info first ‚Ä¶ we need to fix that issue
[07:41:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: any idea popups on this page auto close after a few seconds, but only the first time you open a popup after page load? http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/popup-iframe/ (not only the iframe examples, but also the view source popup)
[07:41:57] <uGoMobi> s/any idea/any idea why/
[07:42:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: removing bottom-tabs is fine to me
[07:44:50] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: as for dialog focus: NVDA let's you use the virtual cursor inside the dialog http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9259#comment:4 - so focusing the dialog probably is less bad there. But we actually have to test in a few ATs what happens when the dialog gets focus
[07:48:45] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i am hoping i'll have access to multiple ATs at this a11y summit next week
[07:50:00] <jzaefferer> With a MacBook and a Win7 VM you can test VoiceOver, NVDA and JAWS - what else would you need?
[07:50:24] <kborchers> can i test JAWS "legally" ‚Ä¶ the way i read it i can't
[07:50:45] <kborchers> also, i don't have a copy of Win7
[07:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> No, you can't.
[07:52:24] <scott_gonzalez> It'll work, but it won't be legal.
[07:52:42] <kborchers> didn't think so ‚Ä¶ i thought i remembered this discussion from a while back
[07:54:04] <kborchers> actually now that i think about it though, i think i do have a copy of win7 around here somewhere.  that's how i was testing NVDA before
[07:54:32] <kborchers> doesn't help with JAWS testing though
[08:02:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looking.
[08:03:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Meanwhile I found the solution to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6540 ... it's enough to call $.mobile.resetPageHeight() after injecting the fixed header. I've commented to that effect. Is that enough to close the bug?
[08:03:10] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6540 by Palestinian (3d 5h ago): Injecting Fixed Header Dynamically - adds extra padding to "active page"
[08:03:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: Popups: What browser?
[08:03:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Ok. Let's keep ticket open. We have to mention that in docs/demos
[08:04:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: tested on Chrome
[08:04:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, I'll add a note to the docs and then I'll close that ticket.
[08:04:25] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#923 (master - 85b3707 : Jasper de Groot): The build was fixed.

[08:04:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I'll update the demos that show the same problem
[08:04:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[08:05:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we, in the library, at any time dynamically inject toolbars into the page? Maybe persistent navbar?
[08:05:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/toolbars/fixed toolbars/
[08:06:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no we dont
[08:06:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: persistant just copy to body temporarily before deleting
[08:06:38] <arschmitz> and they are deprecated
[08:06:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, good. So, there are no instances where we need to follow up with $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight()
[08:07:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so, will you make/update a demo showing how to dynamically inject a fixed toolbar?
[08:07:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup
[08:07:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, good. I'll take care of the API docs.
[08:07:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks
[08:07:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can put an example in there too.
[08:08:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice
[08:10:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you said calling $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight() after injecting the toolbar, but don't you have to call it each time a page is shown?
[08:11:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. It is called each time a page is shown, AFAIK.
[08:22:16] <rxaviers> gnarf, kborchers, just saw your msg. Is it happening again?
[08:22:45] <kborchers> rxaviers: seems ok now so not sure if gnarf or someone else fixed it or if it resolved itself but was not working last night
[08:23:54] <rxaviers> about investigating root cause: I totally agree. I have restarted the server after checking system and logs (although, I've done it very quick). Since it's a production server it's hard to leave service down to investigate :(. But, that should be the case if the issue keeps happening.  Anyway we still have syslog info from last time.
[08:24:44] <rxaviers> kborchers, is last time the same as reported by https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/167 ?
[08:24:44] <b-ot> rxaviers: Issue #167 by nickstinger (2d 12h ago): 504 Gateway Time-out while download
[08:24:49] <rxaviers> or is it one more time?
[08:24:59] <kborchers> rxaviers: yeah, next time i think we need to just keep it down for 30 minutes or an hour and investigate ‚Ä¶ maybe we should prepare a message that we can put on the download builder when it happens so if we leave it down, people will at least know we're looking into it
[08:25:19] <kborchers> rxaviers: no this was another time ‚Ä¶ last night
[08:25:23] <rxaviers> oh!
[08:25:25] <kborchers> someone reported in #jquery
[08:25:36] <rxaviers> bad, but good to know
[08:25:40] <kborchers> yeah
[08:26:31] <gnarf> rxaviers: think you could dig into possible causes and add some extra logging on production?
[08:26:40] <rxaviers> absolutely
[08:26:42] <gnarf> so if it happens again we have a better ide?
[08:26:53] <rxaviers> wondering what could happen, DB had no changes for this period
[08:27:23] <rxaviers> gotta go now.. brb
[08:37:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping! API docs question: Can we give the examples IDs so we can link to them from the longdesc?
[08:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> You mean the standalone examples at the bottom?
[08:38:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah. I did something like <xsl:if test="demoid"><xsl:attribute name="id"><xsl:value-of select="demoid"/></xsl:attribute></xsl:if> in entries2html-base.xsl, but I'm sure there's a more elegant way.
[08:38:54] <scott_gonzalez> The examples already have ids.
[08:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> We just don't have anchors for them.
[08:39:00] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's inside <div class="demo code-demo">
[08:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> For example: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#example-0
[08:39:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, I see ...
[08:39:45] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: You're right.
[08:39:46] <scott_gonzalez> We can add anchor icons to the left of the description to make it easy to get the URL.
[08:40:11] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Nono. That's fine. I think I can use this.
[08:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:40:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks!
[08:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[08:42:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Still, might be nice to be able to override the default ID for examples. I mean, if the <example> has an ID, then grab it, otherwise generate an ID of the form example-n.
[08:42:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Very low priority though.

[09:18:15] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5933 by uGoMobi (5mon 1w ago): Remove auto-enhancement of links in toolbars
[09:18:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[09:18:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and might be good to mention navbar in the ticket
[09:19:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because if I am not mistaken we use buttonMarkup in the navbar widget
[09:22:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I will.

[09:23:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: I've reproduced that auto-closing popup issue.
[09:24:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll have a look at that next.
[09:25:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[09:25:47] <_|Nix|_> Yaaaay! Only 7 issues against 1.4.0.
[09:25:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: FYI - I could also reproduce the issue after I removed the custom code that we use for that demo
[09:26:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's cool. I'll try to reduce it to a simple test case.
[11:00:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: Where's that exactly coming from? All I can find is on this page: http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/demo/FS-demo-downloads.asp - "These free demo releases are fully functional, but require a computer reboot after 40 minutes if you wish to continue using the product."
[11:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I can't find their license, but I know that it's a violation of the license to use the demo for testing.
[11:49:39] <johnbender> Krinkle: ping
[11:49:48] <Krinkle> johnbender: Hi, I received your e-mail.
[11:49:58] <Krinkle> I need to gather some data, but short answer: Yes, sounds good, I can help :)
[11:50:14] <johnbender> Krinkle: wow amazing!
[11:50:22] <johnbender> Krinkle: sorry to pester you I just wanted to make sure you got it
[11:50:28] <Krinkle> np
[11:50:30] <johnbender> Krinkle: not a hurry at all
[11:50:35] <johnbender> Krinkle: thanks!
[11:50:57] <Krinkle> johnbender: btw, now that you're here. Let me buffer through what I have in my draft so you can start doing somethign maybe in the mean time
[11:51:09] <Krinkle> the schema's are in public version control, did you know?
[11:51:15] <johnbender> Krinkle: no, but I wondered
[11:51:26] <johnbender> Krinkle: that's awesome
[11:51:38] <Krinkle> https://git.wikimedia.org/blob/mediawiki%2Fcore.git/master/maintenance%2Ftables.sql
[11:51:41] <johnbender> I didn't see a link in the UCLA paper but there's a lot in there
[11:51:57] <Krinkle> https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-core/blob/master/maintenance/tables.sql
[11:52:10] <johnbender> Krinkle: so awesome
[11:52:12] <Krinkle> that's MediaWiki core, the main software that runs Wikipedia
[11:52:23] <johnbender> Krinkle: so that's the current state of the schema?
[11:52:27] <Krinkle> note, that there's lots of plugins though, which each have their own repo and some have tables, too.
[11:52:29] <johnbender> all I see are creates
[11:52:43] <Krinkle> johnbender: Yep, with upto 2-3 weeks delay, that's the live wikipedia schema
[11:53:05] <Krinkle> we generally deploy every few days, but sql changes usually live in master a bit longer
[11:53:06] <johnbender> Krinkle: so how do you guys do migrations then? Is there an idempotent migration script?
[11:53:16] <Krinkle> johnbender: join #wikimedia-operations for that one
[11:53:23] <Krinkle> I can explain, but they'd correct me
[11:53:48] <johnbender> Krinkle: cool
[11:53:52] <johnbender> I will pop in there to ask
[11:53:56] <johnbender> Krinkle: this is so useful
[11:53:59] <johnbender> I can't thank you enough
[11:54:06] <Krinkle> yw
[11:54:54] <Krinkle> johnbender: are you joining now? I could give a rough impression of what I think the migration proces is, but I'd rather have it in my log of that channel :)
[11:55:17] <johnbender> Krinkle: yah I can do that

[14:02:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[14:02:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You fixed the popup page?

[14:02:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[14:03:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can no longer reproduce it ...
[14:03:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can't reproduce anymore?
[14:03:19] <uGoMobi> huh... weird
[14:03:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. I refreshed the page after pulling in your changes, and it's gone.
[14:04:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll check out the previous HEAD and see if it reoccurs.
[14:05:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can't think of anything I did that could have fixed this issue
[14:06:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Reproduced in incognito.
[14:08:04] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... it's unreliable.

[14:28:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup is closing because there's a stray navigate event.
[14:28:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you think we need to keep the Header, Footer, and Fixed Toolbars entries in the API docs?
[14:29:14] <uGoMobi> (with the link to the new toolbar widget)
[14:29:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There are some things that are specific to each. The code distinguishes between them.
[14:29:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think so. People may have it bookmarked.
[14:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's have a deprecation period for them as well.
[14:30:02] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[14:30:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:30:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After all, we do not remove API documentation for deprecated entries.
[14:30:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As for the closing popup, I suspect it's because one of the iframes is doing some navigating.
[14:31:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh, interesting

[14:32:19] <uGoMobi> I broke some people their bookmark ^^^ ... sorry
[14:32:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You can make a short entry pointing to the new link.
[14:32:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't know if it's actually possible to make a redirect.
[14:33:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suppose it should be possible, because the entries can be plain HTML pages too - like global-config
[14:33:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: global-config is not an XML file. It's a page under pages/
[14:33:44] <uGoMobi> ok, I'll check it out
[14:34:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, I think you can do a client-side redirect with a meta tag.

[14:35:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, if you open the iframe soon enough after the page has finished loading, it will disappear because of the stray navigate event.
[14:36:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if you wait long enough to open the popup, it doesn't happen anymore.
[14:38:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I have to add a funny video to that page to distract people for a few seconds so they won't open the popup yet
[14:38:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's a plan. :)
[14:39:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have identified that the event.target for the stray navigate event is not the window the popup is in, but some other window (probably the iframe).
[14:40:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the question is how to handle this. Should I handle it in popup, or should I handle it in navigate.
[14:40:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In popup it may be complicated because I have to re-attach the event handler, because it's attached with .one().
[14:41:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what kind of fix do you have in mind?
[14:41:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, ignore the event if it's a navigate event and event.target !== this.window
[14:41:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[14:42:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But then I have to re-attach the handler, because it needs to listen to navigate events.
[14:42:14] <uGoMobi> right
[14:42:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, I can attach it permanently, and set a flag as to ignore or not ignore.
[14:43:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but is this only a problem with popup?
[14:43:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or could it also interfere with page navigation
[14:43:17] <uGoMobi> ?
[14:43:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I doubt it. Popup reacts to navigation events, because it needs to clean up the page before the page changes/
[14:44:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pages and dialogs can safely ignore such events, because they don't need to clean up whatever's beneath them.
[14:45:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was reading this bug to see if it's the same https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6025
[14:45:14] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6025 by ottoville (4mon 2w ago): Selectmenu in iframe fails in different conditions
[14:45:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Woah, wait a sec. I'm using .on() and .off() ... so, this could be as easy as returning without calling .off()
[14:46:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I think this is exactly why I didn't use .one()
[14:47:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Events arrive, they're not the ones I'm looking for, so I don't want to have to re-attach.
[14:47:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so you just need to add the event.target check?
[14:47:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: yeah.
[14:49:38] <uGoMobi> nice
[15:00:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, it's not that simple. I was comparing event.target to this.window, but one is a Window object, the other is a jQuery object containing a Window object.
[15:00:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It turns out that the window object for the navigate event is actually the main window, not the iframe :(
[15:01:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, there could be another reason: Chrome does this superfluous popstate whenever it loads a page. It could well do that for iframes too.
[15:02:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can check this with a jQM-free example.
[15:02:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: :(
[15:02:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have you tested it on FF?
