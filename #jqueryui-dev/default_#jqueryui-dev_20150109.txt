[04:50:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: well updating these 2 pr's will keep me busy for a little while :-)
[04:53:49] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: heh, yeah
[04:54:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: was just thinking right now icons are ALWAYS appended 
[04:54:18] <arschmitz> should we prepend when the position is begining and appened if its end?
[04:54:22] <arschmitz> better semantics
[04:54:35] <arschmitz> and means we dont need a position class for begining and end i bet too
[04:55:51] <jzaefferer> if that works, sure
[04:56:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: there may be a catch im not thinking about
[04:56:22] <arschmitz> because i have not actually tried it
[04:56:28] <arschmitz> but it seems like it would make more sense
[04:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'm not following what you're proposing.
[04:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by "position is begining"?
[05:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean the iconPosition option?
[05:19:33] <jzaefferer> I think that's what he's talking about
[05:19:51] <arschmitz> Yes
[05:19:57] <arschmitz> the iconPosition option
[05:21:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[05:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> That seems fine.
[05:22:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats essentially how bootstrap does it
[05:22:24] <arschmitz> they dont have a js widget but they have you just put it where you want it in the markup
[05:22:47] <arschmitz> and thats where it is they dont position it
[05:23:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: better yet maybe i should ask our new chassis friends
[05:26:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: Also fyi i tweet at Ariya right after the meeting and have not had a response so not looking good since hes really active on twitter 
[05:34:28] <jzaefferer> oh well
[05:39:36] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: how does positioning work for top/bottom icons?
[05:39:50] <jzaefferer> don't you still need the class for those?
[05:40:07] <arschmitz> yes
[05:40:14] <arschmitz> you would still need a class for those 
[05:40:28] <arschmitz> would probably prepend for top append for bottom though?
[05:42:50] <jzaefferer> sure
[05:43:07] <jzaefferer> Almost up to 200 comments
[05:43:18] <jzaefferer> Including a bunch of yours...
[05:43:42] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:46:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: my comment to your question about why not _toggle class
[05:47:09] <arschmitz> probably deserves more attention and to be mentioned to more people
[05:47:21] <arschmitz> as its something we need to keep in mind in general
[05:53:59] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: since you both just commented ( on the comment ) about the _enhance method iv been meaning to bring this up
[05:54:18] <arschmitz> are you ok with this sort of thing as a "favor" shall we call it to mobile
[05:54:32] <arschmitz> like if i submitted a pr to do this in tabs and accordion would you be open to it?
[05:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I didn't actually look at the code.
[05:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> At this stage, I'm just reviewing the review.
[05:56:50] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it just takes any dom manipulation and isolates it into its own method
[05:56:56] <arschmitz> ( in create )
[05:57:15] <arschmitz> its more a general question then specific to this review at all
[05:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> Surely not "any DOM manipulation" as that's most of what we do.
[05:57:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I'm not commenting on issues that jscs warns about, there are quite a few
[05:57:36] <arschmitz> that way in mobile to have the enhanced option
[05:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Oh, I have no idea what JSCS does and doesn't catch.
[05:58:13] <jzaefferer> Well, I'm commenting on the style issues that it doesn't catch...
[05:58:34] <jzaefferer> this guy jscs warns about: v
[05:58:35] <jzaefferer> function( value ){
[05:58:39] <arschmitz> we can just do if( this.options.enhanced ) { this._super() } else { do stuff like set vars for things that other wise would have been created } 
[06:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'd have to see what kind of change we're actually talking about.
[06:00:48] <arschmitz> button, checkboxradio, and controlgroup current;y implement this
[06:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> Presumably this is the same thing as the mutate stuff in init-free.
[06:01:02] <arschmitz> its kinda in between
[06:02:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/button/ui/button.js#L71 create and the _enhance function below
[06:02:19] <arschmitz> normally whats in enhance would be in create
[06:02:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[06:02:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wanna talk nav?
[06:02:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hey i actually have to run for like half an hour ( running late due to snow )
[06:03:04] <arschmitz> will you be free in like 30-40 minutes?
[06:03:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's cool. TTY then.
[06:19:30] <jzaefferer> arschmitz scott_gonzalez: once classes lands, we should implement this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10692 - definitely needs to be done along with the new theme
[06:33:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[06:41:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[06:41:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Alright. Lay it on me!
[06:42:03] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah totally this is also something there is an issue around already on chassis
[06:42:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok two big things
[06:42:42] <arschmitz> first what do you think about using a history api polyfill
[06:42:49] <arschmitz> and avoiding dealing with the hash at al
[06:43:02] <arschmitz> for history
[06:43:23] <gabriel_schulhof> A polyfill providing what? pushState?
[06:43:36] <arschmitz> the whole history api
[06:43:51] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/devote/HTML5-History-API
[06:44:32] <arschmitz> or https://github.com/browserstate/History.js/
[06:45:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Looking ...
[06:45:20] <arschmitz> like the navigate event is just a wrapper on hashchange and popstate
[06:45:35] <arschmitz> and most of the method is the same 
[06:46:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah ... If we can get pushState support "for sure" (i.e., via polyfill) we can ignore the hash entirely.
[06:46:22] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean the hashchange.
[06:46:27] <arschmitz> yup
[06:46:40] <arschmitz> would simplify things a log
[06:46:43] <arschmitz> lot
[06:47:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Do we even need the navigate event then?
[06:47:29] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[06:47:36] <arschmitz> thats part of the motivation
[06:48:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK. Count me in.
[06:48:33] <arschmitz> i mean im sure it wont be THAT simple but it seems like worth trying
[06:48:38] <gabriel_schulhof> ... assuming either polyfill does not have any fatal flaws.
[06:48:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: exactly
[06:49:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok next thing the concept john bender talk us into for just update to most recent link url and make them handle that it sends the correct content
[06:49:43] <arschmitz> Cant possibly work 
[06:50:09] <arschmitz> Not only for the reason we already ran into with my multi container implementation
[06:50:51] <arschmitz> same nav sequence we talk about before with 3 containers and 2 pages in each
[06:51:06] <arschmitz> you nav a->2 b->2 c->
[06:51:08] <arschmitz> 2
[06:51:32] <arschmitz> now we say if you refresh the url /c2/ should know to send a and b as well because its a non ajax request
[06:51:50] <arschmitz> but how does it know to send a2 and b2
[06:51:54] <arschmitz> not a1 and b1
[06:51:58] <arschmitz> or a2 and b1
[06:52:11] <arschmitz> unless server side they maintained a history of there own ( not acceptable )
[06:52:26] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, we could have some complicated scheme of encoding this in the hash, but that's pretty complicated.
[06:52:33] <arschmitz> so we need to keep the state of all three in the url
[06:52:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, exactly.
[06:53:04] <arschmitz> which is what you and i argued in the first place
[06:53:13] <arschmitz> but were talked out of
[06:53:36] <gabriel_schulhof> We must not have been sure of ourselves if we were talked out of it :)
[06:53:39] <arschmitz> to allow different URL schemes we will need a generator function of some sort
[06:54:00] <arschmitz> that will take the current url for the contianers and generate a url from it 
[06:54:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, basically. It needs to serialize the state.
[06:54:32] <arschmitz> yup
[06:54:42] <arschmitz> so this isnt news to either of us
[06:54:47] <arschmitz> its just a step back in time a ways
[06:55:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, a simple solution seems to be to just record the ID of the pagecontainer followed by the URL it contains and concatenate that.
[06:55:17] <arschmitz> I was talking with scott_gonzalez the other day and he pointed this out
[06:55:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think the default should be ?container=page&container2=page 
[06:56:15] <arschmitz> it cant be in the hash because it needs to be server readable
[06:56:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Why does it need to be server readable?
[06:56:31] <arschmitz> well potentially server readable
[06:56:37] <arschmitz> by default it does
[06:56:46] <arschmitz> because the server should return the correct content on refresh
[06:57:06] <arschmitz> we should not by default ajax load all the containers on first load 
[06:57:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec. No. We loaded the contents of the pagecontainers via Ajax.
[06:57:31] <arschmitz> we shouldnt thought on first load
[06:57:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, but how do you get the server to send you a second page and display it in an area of an existing page? Only an iframe can do that.
[06:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> So, I talked to Ian about this and he said they don't manage history across many containers.
[06:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> Whichever container was most recently navigated has proper history handling via the back button.
[06:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> But once you reach the last history entry for the current navigation path within that container, you're done.
[06:58:38] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: ... and the back button binds to that container?
[06:58:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that would not really make sense in mobile
[06:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, generally they're dealing with apps, so they have the luxury of a back button per container.
[06:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes some of this easier.
[06:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> But they don't do cross-container state management.
[06:59:14] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah apps are different
[06:59:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah we need to handle that
[06:59:25] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and this is a superset of that.
[06:59:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you know my feelings on this.
[06:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> You can't have anything simple and sane for cross-container management.
[06:59:57] <arschmitz> oh i dont think it will be simple 
[07:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> The default has to be simple though.
[07:00:21] <gabriel_schulhof> If you only have the one pagecontainer, you have what you have now.
[07:00:21] <arschmitz> the default would be query strings
[07:00:25] <arschmitz> which is simple
[07:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> Which means that anyone doing anything with real history across containers will likely be doing their own custom handling.
[07:00:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: How does query strings help though? Would the server assemble the page server-side, and send it with the pagecontainers initially containing the latest of their nav entries upon refresh?
[07:01:02] <arschmitz> and you have a function to properly generate the url which can be over riden
[07:01:19] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it would return the full page like it does today
[07:01:27] <arschmitz> just with the contianers in it all with proper state
[07:01:43] <arschmitz> and if you want to optimize you check if its an ajax request
[07:01:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, so we can't solve this without server buy-in
[07:02:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well the individual links would point to liek /c2/ and just rturn c2 contents
[07:02:42] <arschmitz> but if you go to /?a=2&b=2&c=2
[07:02:48] <arschmitz> it should return all three
[07:03:01] <arschmitz> i kinda mixed schemes there but you get the idea
[07:03:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Not only return all three, but placed into the DOM of the initial page in all the right places.
[07:03:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: correct
[07:03:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and if you ajax load a page like /?a=2&b=2&c=2 we would grab the current page from each container
[07:04:00] <arschmitz> and put it in the corresponding alredy existing container
[07:04:01] <gabriel_schulhof> You know, I remember there was talk of sending multiple pages over a single HTTP request. Was that HTTP/2.0 or was that SPDY or something. That's still a pipe dream, right?
[07:04:44] <arschmitz> YEah cant currently do that
[07:04:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, this is not clean, and I'm starting to think it may be beyond our scope.
[07:05:16] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, if we do this, we're no longer purely client-side.
[07:05:46] <arschmitz> i mean you can be your server does not NEED to parse anything 
[07:05:54] <arschmitz> you could just make pages named properly
[07:06:05] <gabriel_schulhof> The server needs to parse the query string.
[07:06:16] <gabriel_schulhof> ... unless I've misunderstood.
[07:06:20] <arschmitz> you dont need to use a query string
[07:06:44] <arschmitz> it could be /a/1/b/2/c/3
[07:07:01] <arschmitz> or a1b2c2.html
[07:07:19] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, but then you'd need to create all possible combinations of pages and store them on the server.
[07:07:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: right im not saying its sane to not use a server
[07:07:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but what multi contianer use case is not going to requre a serve side of some sort
[07:08:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Why not offer Ajax as the base but with a demo showing the benefits of having server-side support.
[07:08:59] <gabriel_schulhof> We already have such a demo showing the benefits of discarding headers server-side.
[07:09:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not completely following what your seeing as the difference here
[07:09:45] <arschmitz> you mean you want it to default to storing in the hash?
[07:10:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Nono. Irrespective of how we structure the location, if we do not want to rely on the server at all, we have no choice but to Ajax in the contents of the various page containers upon startup.
[07:11:20] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm saying this should be the default behaviour, but we should have a demo illustrating that it's better to have the server assemble the start page using whatever structure will be present in the location, avoiding the need for Ajax requests.
[07:11:28] <arschmitz> hmm thats really really terrible for startup time 
[07:11:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Right, exactly. Hence the demo showing how to improve startup time by gaining the server's cooperation.
[07:12:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The client side obviously understands whatever scheme it uses to encode the history in the location.
[07:12:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i guess what im saying is i would make it an option and have it default to assuming the correct content is in each container on init
[07:12:56] <arschmitz> and if your case does not guarantee that then change the option
[07:13:16] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or fix the server-side.
[07:13:21] <arschmitz> because with single container we assume correct content ( in all history api supporting browsers )
[07:13:35] <arschmitz> so id like to keep that the same
[07:13:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's definitely simpler.
[07:14:59] <arschmitz> but if you want to have it load every container via ajax on init that easy enough to support
[07:15:47] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: does that work for what your wanting?
[07:16:12] <gabriel_schulhof> You know, we're treading into iframe territory here. If a page has two iframes, that's three HTTP requests.
[07:16:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes we should more or less think about it like we would iframes
[07:16:59] <arschmitz> but also remember by default its only 1 regardless of how many containers
[07:17:26] <arschmitz> each page container is kinda like an iframe
[07:17:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, but I'm trying to point out that it would be up to us to initiate the other two requests - only they would be Ajax, not HTTP.
[07:17:47] <arschmitz> correct
[07:17:54] <gabriel_schulhof> If it were to work exactly like iframes.
[07:18:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Unlike iframes, however, we have the opportunity to allow the server to optimize, because it's all one DOM.
[07:18:22] <arschmitz> correct
[07:18:57] <arschmitz> each response can be just html for the actual section
[07:19:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait a sec.
[07:19:22] <gabriel_schulhof> We can assume that the pagecontainer has the right content, but if it doesn't, we issue the Ajax request.
[07:19:41] <gabriel_schulhof> We can determine whether the content is correct, for example, via the data-url attribute.
[07:20:02] <arschmitz> hmm thats something to think about
[07:20:10] <gabriel_schulhof> If the data-url for a given pagecontainer matches what the location says it should be, that means the server has taken care of providing the right content. Otherwise, Ajax.
[07:20:12] <arschmitz> i was thinking we have no way of knowing if its the correct contet or not
[07:20:21] <arschmitz> but data-url could work for that
[07:20:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[07:20:34] <arschmitz> ok i like that
[07:20:38] <arschmitz> no needfor an option
[07:20:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah. We just sync up the location with the actual displayed data upon startup.
[07:21:05] <arschmitz> we will need 2 extension points 
[07:21:09] <arschmitz> a url generator
[07:21:12] <arschmitz> and a url parser
[07:21:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, definitely!
[07:21:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Why need they be separate?
[07:21:37] <arschmitz> one should take a hash of pagecontainers and return a string
[07:21:48] <arschmitz> the other should take a string and return a hash of contianers
[07:23:07] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm thinking have one object with a function that does URL->{id1: data-url2, id2: data-url2, ...} and another function that does {id1: data-url1, id2: data-url2, ...} -> URL.
[07:23:29] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and pagecontainer has an option the value of which is such an object.
[07:23:48] <arschmitz> this would not be specific to a container
[07:24:01] <arschmitz> it would be for everything
[07:24:18] <arschmitz> because all contianers have to use the same scheme you couldnt mix
[07:24:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but then what do you call that? pagecontainercontainer?
[07:24:44] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[07:24:51] <arschmitz> so i was thinking like $.mobile.path.generate and $.mobile.page.parse
[07:25:02] <arschmitz> path on second not page
[07:25:35] <arschmitz> maybe better more descriptive names
[07:25:38] <arschmitz> but you get the idea
[07:26:11] <gabriel_schulhof> This also means that the click handler needs to be inside pagecontainer.
[07:26:59] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so that it may intercept, prevent default on the click, update the location, and load the page.
[07:27:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yup
[07:28:13] <gabriel_schulhof> And so the current setup, which is pagecontainer on body, becomes a special case of the new setup, which is that the body may contain anything, and the body itself is not necessarily an instance of pagecontainer.
[07:28:17] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: iv also been thinking
[07:28:30] <arschmitz> right
[07:29:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we should keep an array of containers on $.mobile
[07:29:14] <arschmitz> to stop people from wanting to :mobile-pagecontiane
[07:29:31] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, but which one's your parent?
[07:29:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, it'd most often be .closest( ":mobile-pagecontainer" )
[07:30:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: this.element.closest( $.mobile.pagecontainers )
[07:30:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Is this faster than using a class?
[07:30:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: was just pinged by dekajp about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1398 - you were going to review that, right?
[07:30:30] <gabriel_schulhof> We already have ui-viewport, I think.
[07:30:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well your only checking like 2 or 3 elements
[07:30:51] <arschmitz> instead of traversing up the dom
[07:30:59] <arschmitz> so i would assume but id have to try it to be sure
[07:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yeah, I'll be getting to that today.
[07:31:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You'd have to at least run $.contains for each member of $.mobile.pagecontainers.
[07:31:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I mean, correctness requires that.
[07:32:02] <arschmitz> i dont think so closest has to be a parent child relationship
[07:32:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, so you work your way towards HTML, checking along each step whether the element you're at is in $.mobile.pagecontainers.
[07:33:30] <arschmitz> right and thats a direct equality check not a selector
[07:33:47] <arschmitz> because your passing elements not a selector to closest
[07:33:56] <arschmitz> not I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS
[07:34:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I know, I know.
[07:34:09] <gabriel_schulhof> It just seems the most logical way of implementing it.
[07:34:17] <arschmitz> yes
[07:34:33] <arschmitz> if it works as i think it would internally in core this would be the best way
[07:34:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Aside: Speaking of performance: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/enhancer/js/widgets/enhancer.js#L69 should be $.data( this.element[ 0 ] );
[07:34:49] <arschmitz> nope
[07:34:54] <arschmitz> does not work
[07:34:59] <arschmitz> that only gets the data object
[07:35:02] <arschmitz> not the attributres
[07:35:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK.
[07:35:10] <gabriel_schulhof> That's why it's so fast.
[07:35:12] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[07:35:14] <arschmitz> yup
[07:35:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: interesting note
[07:35:44] <arschmitz> if you have previously called $.fn.data
[07:35:50] <arschmitz> $.data will then work
[07:36:08] <arschmitz> because the first call to $.fn.data on an element populates the data object with the attributes
[07:36:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Wait, what? http://jsperf.com/jqm-data-bulk/4
[07:36:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, yeah. I only have three in the dump.
[07:36:58] <gabriel_schulhof> NM.
[07:37:38] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, that's nasty! That jsperf only works because of the order in which I check to make sure that the various snippets are correct!
[07:37:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Score 1 for functional programming *shake head*
[07:38:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so if you knowfor sure $.fn.data has previously been called 
[07:38:15] <arschmitz> you can just use $.data and save the perf
[07:38:24] <gabriel_schulhof> Nonono ... I take it all back - we can't assume that.
[07:38:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cant assume what?
[07:39:15] <arschmitz> that $.fn.data has been called?
[07:39:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, we can't assume that, I don't think.
[07:39:41] <arschmitz> no we cant
[07:39:43] <arschmitz> at all
[07:39:56] <arschmitz> thats why im not using $.data there
[07:40:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, got it.
[07:40:10] <gabriel_schulhof> http://jsperf.com/jqm-data-bulk/5 shows it black and white.
[07:40:22] <arschmitz> infact i can tell you 100% for sure we are NOT Calling it
[07:40:29] <arschmitz> because switching breaks all the widgets
[07:40:56] <gabriel_schulhof> switching?
[07:42:01] <arschmitz> to $.data
[07:42:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK. I see.
[07:42:26] <arschmitz> none of the options get read in
[07:42:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway, aside aside, $.mobile.pagecontainers sounds good.
[07:43:10] <arschmitz> because i forgot initally that was the case because you had commented that on the gist
[07:43:18] <arschmitz> so with out thinking i switched it and broke everything
[07:43:24] <arschmitz> :)
[07:43:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[07:44:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im pretty sure there is a note in the core api about it 
[07:44:17] <arschmitz> which is why i knew the difference
[07:44:49] <gabriel_schulhof> I probably knew it too, and I just knee-jerk-reacted when I saw this.element.data()
[07:44:56] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:46:05] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Sounds like we have a plan forward with nav. It's quite a doozy though, implementation-whise.
[07:46:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:46:19] <gabriel_schulhof> What, if any of it shall we do for 1.5.0?
[07:46:51] <arschmitz> "Regarding HTML5 data-* attributes: This low-level method does NOT retrieve the data-* attributes unless the more convenient .data() method has already retrieved them."
[07:47:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: id say *fairly* unlikely anything
[07:47:52] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew* ... I was kinda hoping you'd say that.
[07:48:07] <gabriel_schulhof> I already have a small army's worth on my plate.
[07:48:07] <arschmitz> im waiting to see though we may be getting some help from ianmaffet 
[07:48:25] <arschmitz> but i still wouldnt see anything being done in time for 1.5
[07:48:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, if he can get rid of navigate and hashchange and replace it with the polyfill, that would already be a huge help.
[07:49:15] <gabriel_schulhof> That way we can start with a "clean" implementation, if only clean via polyfill.
[07:49:28] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, we need to make sure the polyfills are all they're cracked up to be.
[07:50:05] <arschmitz> yup
[07:50:19] <arschmitz> there are like 170 open issues on history.js and no update since april
[07:50:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Does not sound promising.
[07:52:04] <gabriel_schulhof> HTML5-History-API looks better, although it seems pretty new-on-the-block.
[07:52:29] <arschmitz> yup
[07:53:04] <arschmitz> so not even sure if they are an option
[07:53:18] <arschmitz> or if maybe we could contribute to fix some problems critical to us?
[07:53:40] <arschmitz> if possible id like to see us contribute to fix them and use one still
[07:53:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, we'd have to see what kind of response we can get.
[07:53:57] <arschmitz> yup
[07:54:28] <arschmitz> HTML5-History-API has russian documentation maybe marklog knows them lol

[09:21:44] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I've spend half an hour implementing an esformatter plugin that deals with objects on a single line.

I've asked Miller for some guidance, hopefully I can make it work with some of his input. Then after landing the various PRs, I could just formatting the whole bunch of unit tests

[14:00:26] <lisa_deluca> @arschmitz are you here?
[14:37:56] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: i am
[14:38:10] <lisa_deluca> howdy, thanks for helping me debug what i was looking at
[14:38:13] <lisa_deluca> confused there for a sec
[14:38:19] <lisa_deluca> i just sent another screenshot
[14:38:23] <arschmitz> Yeah its pretty subtle 
[14:38:23] <lisa_deluca> it looks like my css isn't being applied
[14:39:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: the new fix i dont think causes the issue
[14:39:37] <arschmitz> its just also needed to completely fix it
[14:42:31] <lisa_deluca> okay, so this would be a new pull request then that's unrelated?
[14:42:35] <arschmitz> no
[14:42:46] <arschmitz> they are both regressions for the fix in 1.4.5
[14:43:07] <arschmitz> it should be 2 commits in 1 pr one for slider and one for rangeslider
[14:43:19] <lisa_deluca> ah, alright, i can handle that
[14:43:24] <lisa_deluca> all makes sense now
[14:43:28] <lisa_deluca> i thought it was me breaking something
[14:43:31] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: awesome thanks
[14:43:34] <lisa_deluca> good to know it's just another thing that needs to be fixed
[14:43:36] <lisa_deluca> phew
[14:43:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: Kinda just it happened in 1.4.5 :-)
[14:43:57] <arschmitz> same thing you already knew you broke 
[14:44:23] <lisa_deluca> alright, on it.  have a great weekend!
[14:44:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: awesome thanks :-)!
[14:44:44] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and you too!
[14:45:18] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: also..
[14:45:41] <arschmitz> previously you had asked me about specific things for you to work on
[14:46:07] <arschmitz> iv been thinking about this related to some other things and have been coming up with specific lits of todo's and projects
[14:46:15] <arschmitz> so any time you might be looking again just ask :-)
[14:46:28] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: okay, I will definitely take you up on that
[14:47:11] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and if there is a specific area with in mobile you want to dig into let me know and i can probably give you tasks specific to that area
[14:47:39] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: thank you.  I appreciate it.  It's been fun working with you all.  You've been very welcoming
[14:47:50] <lisa_deluca> I appreciate the hand holding on a few areas too where I'm slowly picking up how things are done
[14:47:54] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: great to hear we try!
[14:48:22] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: oh no worries on that at all i really dont mind there's way to much to the library to expect you to just figure it out
