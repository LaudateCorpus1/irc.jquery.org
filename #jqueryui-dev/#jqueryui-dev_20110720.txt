[04:14:39] <gnarf> someone feel like trying to translate this guys bug into a frickin demo or should we just kill it? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7569
[04:14:48] <gnarf> I'm giving up
[05:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: commented on both pulls and the ticket (that guy seems dense)
[05:39:44] <gnarf> :)
[05:39:45] <gnarf> thx
[05:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> but... http://jsfiddle.net/Q5GT6/1/
[05:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> is the wrapper duplicating the margins or something?
[05:41:12] <gnarf> quite possibly
[05:41:16] <gnarf> yeah
[05:41:21] <gnarf> its just cuz its "div"
[05:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> ahhh...
[05:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> stupid wrappers always getting in the way and screwing up selectors
[05:42:08] <gnarf> er
[05:42:10] <gnarf> not
[05:42:22] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/Q5GT6/4/
[05:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/Q5GT6/5/
[05:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh, we did the same thing
[05:43:44] <gnarf> and here it is on git version: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/Q5GT6/8/
[05:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> well, seems like we can at least change the ticket to a bug with an actual test case
[05:43:56] <gnarf> maybe
[05:44:01] <gnarf> :)
[05:44:24] <gnarf> i gotta run tho
[05:44:29] <gnarf> check on it in an hr
[06:31:01] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/8224c67...e2a9b0c
[06:31:01] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Accordion: Stop current hide animation, jump to last animation and calculate percentages for padding in addition to height. Fixes #3532 - Accordion: Activating a panel during animation fails - kborchers
[06:31:01] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Merge pull request #368 from kborchers/bug_3532_2 - Scott González
[06:55:14] <kborchers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez: i'll be in a meeting during the UI meeting but will be watching. Need any info from me in case I can't chime in? Making a lot of progress on menu. Most info should be up to date on the wiki.
[06:55:56] <kborchers> I would like it if people could comment on my anchor focus issue with navigation menus and the comments from Dalia on the wiki if possible
[06:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't need anything (have been fairly out of the loop this month)
[07:02:33] <jzaefferer> I'll try to get up to speed on the menu issues
[07:05:21] <gnarf> i think everyone jQuery is out of the loop this month
[07:05:22] <gnarf> :)
[07:07:08] <gnarf> wow
[07:07:16] <gnarf> this bug keeps getting better scott_gonzalez
[07:07:21] <gnarf> glad you caught the margin ;)
[07:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh, well your first fiddle assigned an id but styled by class :-P
[07:09:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[07:10:32] <gnarf> i think the createWrapper() is using outerHeight()
[07:11:24] <kborchers> thanks jzaefferer. let me know if you have any ?'s in the next 30-45 minutes if possible as i will be in my meeting after that.
[07:12:25] <jzaefferer> yeah, probably not...
[07:13:17] <kborchers> ok, if you have ?'s throw them out and i may be able to sneak in some response during the meeting from my iPad ;)
[07:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, overlapping margins is gonna be a problem
[07:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> we'd need to move the margins from the element to the wrapper
[07:16:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ewwwww
[07:17:02] <gnarf> although i suppose its the only solution
[07:17:10] <gnarf> it might solve the margin 0px auto issue too?
[07:17:27] <gnarf> but i doubt it
[07:18:00] <gnarf> most of these effects behave badly when the element isn't absolute
[07:18:16] <gnarf> from a margin/padding/etc standpoint
[07:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, this might fix a lot of that
[07:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: where were you working on widget docs?
[07:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> *widget factory docs
[07:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> and what's the status of that?
[07:56:49] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can cover that in an hour when we have our meeting
[08:01:47] <gnarf> heh
[08:02:00] <gnarf> im debating if i want to walk home for the meet or not
[10:15:44] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/51ee3be39829e339c8e4bccb532347944e600ca5
[10:15:44] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Widget demo: Add a button to change the color of the widget. - Scott González
[10:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: working on the widget factory docs now; good job on the overview text :-)
[10:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> "and obfuscates a number of repetitive tasks." is obfuscates the best word to use there?
[10:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> eliminates?
[10:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> obliterates :-P
[10:29:37] <ajpiano> heh
[10:29:52] <ajpiano> well it doesn't eliminate them, it just means you don't have to do them
[10:29:57] <ajpiano> "generalizes"
[10:30:02] <ajpiano> thx scott_gonzalez :)
[10:30:21] <gnarf> k, well, i'll start diving into "open" timepicker maybe / happy to do what I can to help those others on the other widgets
[10:31:55] <ajpiano> in other parts of the text i use "obscure away" with the same intention, but i suppose i'm open to changing it
[10:48:33] <jzaefferer> just got an update from felixge, he's working on the build stuff still, luckily he decided to not tackle the docs download
[11:02:46] <rworth> you mean, since it'll change?
[11:04:07] <gnarf> "and DRYs up a lot of the repetitive tasks you were responsible for in the past." @ajpiano
[11:04:17] <gnarf> ?
[11:04:27] <gnarf> "handles"
[11:07:06] <ajpiano> "abstracts" would probably be ideal
[12:31:04] <kborchers> so i'm writing a unit test for keyboard nav in Menu. traversing a single level menu by simulating keydown works fine.
[12:31:15] <kborchers> when i simulate RIGHT to open a submenu, it changes the submenu to display:block but the ui-state-focus class which is what i'm testing for doesn't move to the submenu's first item. any ideas why?
[12:31:35] <kborchers> it works when doing the keyboard nav manually, just not with simulate.
[12:35:58] <kborchers> i'm new to writing my own tests, i have only modified existing ones so may be doing something wrong (most likely explanation)
[12:41:52] <kborchers> gnarf jzaefferer ^^^
[12:42:12] <kborchers> here is a fiddle. it doesn't work but shows you the pieces i'm working with http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/KXrN2/
[12:43:51] <jzaefferer> kborchers, usually the approach for unit tests should be two steps: in the first, trigger events and check if the right methods are called, in the second, triggers those methods directly and verify the result
[12:44:07] <jzaefferer> that way you decouple triggering events from whatever action should actually happen
[12:44:15] <jzaefferer> autocomplete has good examples of that (I think)
[12:45:40] <kborchers> yeah, i was looking at autocomplete for help but was trying to stay simple at first. i'll try rewriting in that way and see if that helps. thanks
[12:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> this may be a bit too crazy... https://gist.github.com/1095783
[12:59:37] <scott_gonzalez> $( el ).widget( $.ui.accordion, { active: 2 } )
[13:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> and then later:
[13:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> $( el ).widget( $.ui.accordion, "option", "active", 3 )
[13:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> at least that's the intention, I haven't actually tested the method part
[13:19:41] <jzaefferer> is that for pleasing the "but why use namespaces when $.fn has none" crowd?
[13:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> no, it's to solve the dependency issue
[13:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> $.ui.autocomplete relying on $.ui.menu
[13:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> and having autocomplete work even if someone includes another menu widget
[13:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> or if Wijmo extends menu and autocomplete and they want their autocomplete to use their menu
[13:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> inside autocomplete instead of
[13:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> .menu( options )
[13:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> we'd do something like:
[13:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> .widget( this.dependencies.menu, options )
[13:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> and we'd define all widget dependencies inside the widgets
[13:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> dependencies: { menu: $.ui.menu }
