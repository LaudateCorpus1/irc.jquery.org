[03:29:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I am working on DB, so you can test your release script. It happens I have found out some AMD build stuff that needed updates, and some jQuery UI stuff that needs to be fixed also.
[03:30:03] <rxaviers> eg. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/i18n/datepicker-hu.js#L6-L7
[03:32:11] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: sure, but have you actually changed anything?
[03:32:17] <jzaefferer> I don't see new commits on https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/commits/amd-build
[03:33:08] <jzaefferer> just installed from amd-build brand an reran my script, nothing changed
[03:33:37] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, no. I am working on it.
[03:35:28] <rxaviers> will soon get you posted on the updates
[03:49:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7134 and I'm finding various inconsistencies with internal vs. external toolbars, and especially footers.
[03:49:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: Hey!
[03:49:55] <_|Nix|_> :)
[03:50:33] <_|Nix|_> So, when you have an external header and footer, the page does not take that into account when it computes the height via resetActivePageHeight()
[03:51:25] <_|Nix|_> I'm changing that, but I'm noticing that when a page has both an internal header and footer, the footer appears right after the end of the content, even though the page height is set by resetActivePageHeight().
[03:52:35] <_|Nix|_> So, the inconsistency here is that if you take a super-normal <page><header/><content/><footer/></page> then it will appear to be only as tall as the content, but if you now move the header and the footer outside the page, it will appear to be as tall as the window.
[03:54:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/262 vs. http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/263
[03:56:55] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, thanks. Let me know when you've got something to test
[03:57:06] <rxaviers> sure, I will
[03:57:45] <_|Nix|_> Also, the slide transition seems to fail if you have external non-fixed header and footer: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/264

[08:03:19] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, master is ready for your tests
[08:07:25] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:12:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, it worries me the fact we don't test the built bundle we release. In theory, the pieces have been tested, so the bundle should pass as well. Although, the built bundle is not the concatenated result as it used to be in the past, ie. individual wrappers are cut off [1], and a new wrapper is created [2] (names could possibly clash, or something not-imagined-before could happen, note the adhoc intro for I18n to deal with d
[08:12:39] <rxaviers> atepicker dependency)
[08:12:45] <rxaviers> 1: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/lib/builder.1.11.0.js#L77-L86
[08:12:45] <rxaviers> 2: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/lib/builder.1.11.0.js#L13-L37
[08:15:16] <rxaviers> *: (names could possibly clash, or something not-imagined-before could happen) As a curiosity, note the adhoc intro for I18n to deal with datepicker dependency.
[08:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> We can block the release until we add the ability to test against a build back into our test suite.

[08:53:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: looks like Chrome 32 now has the same issue with the dialog test as Opera 17/18: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1620972
[08:53:32] <jzaefferer> a regression in blink or chromium?
[08:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not surprised. I figured it'd be a Blink problem.
[08:54:40] <jzaefferer> I'm still on 31
[08:57:03] <jzaefferer> And it works fine on Canary/33

[09:59:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[10:03:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7134 ... I don't think this has anything to do with the toolbars or resetActivePageHeight. The page gets same height in both cases, but with internal toolbars the footer comes after content and with external it comes after the page.
[10:05:34] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez tj_vantoll: still should "discuss" bower
[10:05:42] <jzaefferer> if only to confirm what we discussed already
[10:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:09:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if we reduce the page height the external footer looks like it is fixed which it isn't, so I don't think we should do anything about this
[10:17:30] <tj_vantoll> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: I'm going to be afk for a bit, but my plan is to land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1189 as is, write an article about how to use Bower + jQuery UI for the learn site, then look into using Bower for devDependencies.
[10:17:30] <tj_vantoll> At a future time we might want writeup why we're not using jquery/jquery-ui as the canonical Bower repo, but for now the learn article will just tell you how to use the component repo (and might mention that you can still do bower install jquery/jquery-ui).
[10:17:30] <tj_vantoll> If anyone has any issues with that ping me, otherwise I'll be working on it starting tomorrow.
[10:18:24] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: sounds good to me
[10:18:47] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll: you may want to involve rxaviers in adding devDependencies, I think he spent some time looking into that already
[10:19:45] <tj_vantoll> Cool. I'll make sure to check with rxaviers.

[10:34:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what's the likelyhood of doing another 1.10 release?
[10:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> Seems plausible.
[10:34:43] <jzaefferer> the 1-10 jenkins job is crap, I don't really want to spend time fixing it :/
[10:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> The job config itself or the results?
[10:50:31] <jzaefferer> well, the job itself still builds minified files, which we dropped on master a while ago; the TestSwarm parts has a few failing tests, but that looks like it mostly mirros what happens on master
[10:58:29] <jzaefferer> stupid IE10: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2559
[11:00:42] <jzaefferer> well, gonna have to start with that dialog test
[11:00:48] <jzaefferer> maybe the ie10 failures are going away :
