[06:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[07:11:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that bug sucks!!! have no idea why it does that. really weird because it seems specific to that _isOpen var.
[07:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it doesn't make any sense
[07:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> that's why I don't think anyone's going to solve it

[10:06:54] <ruprict> @scott_gonzalez How's the response been on the node.js help for the download builder?
[10:07:09] <ruprict> HMPH, I guess you *just* posted that...sorry.
[10:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah
[10:07:42] <ruprict> Well, I am pretty new to node, but would like to help where I can.
[10:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> add a comment on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/41505725/Download%20Builder%20Rewrite so we make sure to keep you in the loop
[10:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> or reply to the post in the nodejs group
[10:11:02] <ruprict> K…will do…thx
[10:38:18] <kborchers> jzaefferer: in the meeting were you guys talking about needing machines/VM's that sit and run the testswarm tests in all of the browsers or did these clients need to do more than that?
[10:44:06] <kborchers> if that's all that needs to be scripted, it should be pretty simple ... i just did it here on a winXP VM. one small batch file, a little browser and path config and presto. a machine that starts all browsers at http://swarm.jquery.org/run/kborchers/ at startup and restarts every 4 hours to ensure the browsers reconnect if they get hung up. does it need more than that? am i over simplifying?
[10:51:21] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that sounds very good
[10:51:55] <jzaefferer> next step would be to get that on a system/VM that keeps running all the time, e.g. on a (mt) server of ours
[10:52:09] <jzaefferer> rworth: any thoughts?
[10:57:23] <kborchers> jzaefferer: it should be pretty simple, i just set all of the browsers home pages to my testswarm account, added the executable for each browser to the system path, then created a batch file with "start iexplore" or "start firefox" on separate lines for each browser
[10:57:38] <rworth> sounds like a good starting point
[10:57:54] <rworth> you'll have to do some testing with whether multiple browsers works well enough on a single VM
[10:58:06] <kborchers> then the last line of the batch file is shutdown -r -t 14400 which restarts after 4 hours
[10:58:11] <rworth> guess it's time to get what you wrote in a github repo :)
[10:58:25] <kborchers> ok
[12:18:35] <kborchers> rworth, jzaefferer: https://github.com/kborchers/Automated-TestSwarm-Client---Windows
[14:05:37] <jzaefferer> kborchers: that looks almost too easy
[14:05:50] <kborchers> i know right?
[14:06:28] <jzaefferer> there are still a few details
[14:06:44] <jzaefferer> like testing firefox 3.6 + latest
[14:07:06] <kborchers> i would just use separate VM's .... same for multiple IE's
[14:07:07] <jzaefferer> maybe testing multiple chrome channels in the future (testing only chrome-whatever is a bit dangerous)
[14:08:18] <jzaefferer> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/02/reliable-cross-browser-testing-part-1-internet-explorer/
[14:09:09] <jzaefferer> he's saying two VMs, right?
[14:09:18] <jzaefferer> one for IE7 with WinXP, rest on Win7
[14:09:44] <jzaefferer> could then put Firefox 3.6 and Chrome stable on WinXP, Chrome dev/canary (whatever) on the other
[14:09:52] <jzaefferer> one version of opera on each
[14:10:32] <jzaefferer> have you checked out IECollection?
[14:11:41] <kborchers> I have not, i have separate VM's for each version of IE
[14:12:40] <jzaefferer> ok
[14:13:05] <jzaefferer> well, seems like it would be nice if we could get away with two VMs
[14:13:07] <kborchers> at least at work, that's what i have. at home, i only have one (on my Mac) i have virtual box with just one Win7/IE9 install and then I test old browsers at work or ask others to test
[14:13:14] <jzaefferer> and then distribute those to a few people :-)
[14:13:28] <kborchers> yeah, that would be ideal
[14:13:28] <jzaefferer> I've got four VMs on this MBA
[14:13:49] <jzaefferer> I keep them up as brief as possible...
[14:14:12] <kborchers> yeah, i just don't have 4 legal copies of windows
[14:14:31] <kborchers> i guess i could install a second as i have a copy of xp laying around somewhere
