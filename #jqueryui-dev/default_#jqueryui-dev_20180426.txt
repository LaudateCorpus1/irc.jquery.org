[01:01:05] <rich_> Hello, I have a question. I hope I'm in the right channel. I'm trying to display 4 columns in the product carousal in here (https://zadroinc.com/this-is-a-test), but I can't seem to find the jquery code that controls it. Does anyone mind taking a quick look?
[09:23:33] <pashkinmv> Is there any way to disable Keyboard interaction in jquery ui autocomplete?
