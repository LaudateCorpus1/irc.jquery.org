[11:13:50] <rain01_> Can anyone explain why the old version of jQuery autocomplete plugin takes 11ms to run and the new jQuery UI autocomplete takes 100+ms to run?
[11:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> rain01_: Do you have a reduced test case showing the slow down?
[11:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> rain01_: Also, can you clarify what old and new mean?
[11:19:17] <rain01_> no... I just tested it on my site where I updated from jq 1.3.2 to jq 1.9.0 and replaced the old http://bassistance.de autocomplete plugin with jq UI autocomplete and the results surprised me :/
[11:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> What are you measuring?
[11:19:58] <rain01_> old = newest from bassistance.de and new = jQueryUI 1.10
[11:22:45] <rain01_> just measuring autocomplete between var start_ac = Date.now(); and console.log('init autocomplete: ' + (Date.now() - start_ac));
[11:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> "just measuring autocomplete" what code is between those two lines?
[11:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just element.autocomplete()
[11:27:23] <rain01_> no... not just... one sec... I'll try to find a place to upload something
[11:37:59] <rain01_> this is old http://pastebin.com/efqH41Lp and this is new http://pastebin.com/UkYfvHBc
[11:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> What browser are you seeing 110+ms in for that?
[11:40:25] <rain01_> and not only one autocomplete but theres many... that's why the numbers are so high also
[11:41:16] <rain01_> ie9... last chrome is little faster
[11:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting 24ms consistently in IE9.
[11:43:27] <rain01_> I'm just thinking... that maybe jQueryUI is just overkill for that one thing then?
[11:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> And ~11ms in Chrome.
[11:43:55] <rain01_> old or new?
[11:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery UI 1.10.0.
[11:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> I have no interest in testing the old plugin which has been deprecated for a long time now.
[11:44:45] <rain01_> can you try the http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/ version and see the speed difference? :/
[11:45:22] <rain01_> well... deprecated or not... it seems to be much faster
[11:45:39] <scott_gonzalez> There are probably huge differences in what they do on initialization.
[11:46:18] <rain01_> yeah, probably :/
[11:49:20] <rain01_> so jQueryUI is worth installing only if I want to use more than just autocomplete, I guess
[11:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> There's a simple perf boost I can land.
[11:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> No, definitely not.
[11:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery UI autocomplete is worth using even just for autocomplete.
[11:51:57] <rain01_> What would be the reasons to use it if it's slower? What's the performance boost? :o
[11:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> The reasons to use it are: it's supported, it has way fewer bugs, it has better accessibility
[11:53:08] <scott_gonzalez> The perf boose is not using .is() to figure out whether the autocomplete is multi-line capable.
[11:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> s/boose/boost/
[11:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Any objection to me using $.nodeName() in UI?
[11:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's not documented, but I'm pretty sure it has existed forever.
[11:57:52] <DaveMethvin> i never liked it, scott_gonzalez, half the time i need to check for two nodeNames and i can't do it
[11:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> Is the case matching really necessary?
[11:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> Are there UAs that don't return uppercase?
[11:58:44] <DaveMethvin> xhtml?
[11:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[11:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, .is() is super slow compared to a direct nodeName check.
[11:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> is: 1.647ms default.html:45
[11:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> nodeName: 0.043ms
[11:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, ignore that "default.html:45" part :-P
[11:59:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah, .is() definitely isn't the best way to do much of anything
[11:59:54] <DaveMethvin> it's just "short"
[12:00:08] <DaveMethvin> like .is("checked")
[12:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> rain01_: This is gonna drop 2ms in Chrome.
[12:09:56] <rain01_> ok... it's just that I don't feel that comfortable editing the UI code yet and there seems to lots of places where .is() is used and there must be a reason why .is() is used.... right?
[12:12:34] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, ran some tests and the label selector is not what is slowing down button in large docs
[12:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> rain01_: Because it's the jQuery way.
[12:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin rain01_: This is interesting. When I time the code that uses .is(), I can shave off a few ms. But the total time to initialize the widget stays the same.
[12:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm using console.time() and it's synchronous, so there's no issue with timer resolution.
[12:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Were you able to track it down to something else?
[12:14:34] <DaveMethvin> the reflows have to dominate it though i'd think
[12:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> could be.
[12:14:47] <DaveMethvin> maybe some of that happens in another thread and overlaps?
[12:15:33] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, not yet, jI created it a test where the labels had ID like lblbtnID   so the label has the same id as the button and changed the selector to use that,
[12:15:48] <djQuery> it ran about the same time as stock on 5000 buttons
[12:16:10] <djQuery> then changed it again to use just an attribute selector 
[12:16:26] <djQuery> the attribute selector was slower but no by much
[12:16:42] <djQuery> [for=buttonid]
[12:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> We should test with a reasonable number.
[12:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> Like 100
[12:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> I guess people might go overboard, so maybe 500?
[12:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like 5,000 buttons on a page is just bad design.
[12:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> rain01_: Most of this time comes from the menu widget.
[12:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go.

[13:49:46] <jzaefferer> djQuery: I'm not following. What destroy event? How would a hide event be different?
[15:09:25] <djQuery> a hide even doesnt destroy the item causing it to need to be recreated
[15:10:04] <djQuery> jzaefferer, we have a hide option that hides the dialog but no callback for when hide occurs
[15:10:18] <djQuery> after thinking bout it for a bit dont realy need it
[18:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Dialogs open and close, they don't show and hide.
[18:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> And closing has nothing to do with destroying.
