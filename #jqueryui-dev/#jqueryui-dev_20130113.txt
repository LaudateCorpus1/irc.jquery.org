[10:50:55] <mr_daniel> I click and hold the mouse button to slide the slider. But when I leave the browser window, why is the slider still sliding? How is this achieved? Obviously not with "mousemove" event, which trick is used here? http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[10:52:57] <mr_daniel> I am coding a little slider-div myself and I use event like "mousedown", "mousemove" and "mouseout". But with those "traditional" events I see no chance to achieve a similar "outside-browser-still-sliding" effect like the Sliderin jQuier-ui.

[18:50:50] <mikesherov> petro: you there?
[18:51:01] <petro> yeah
[18:51:32] <mikesherov> good stuff on the refactor
[18:51:56] <petro> thanks, i saw your comment about the superfluous 'clip'
[18:52:07] <petro> i'm making the webkit bug a support test at the moment
[18:52:11] <mikesherov> that parseFloat stuff also should be || 0
[18:52:20] <petro> $.support.clipAutoValues
[18:52:46] <petro> oh and parsefloat only has 1 arg
[18:52:50] <petro> lol
[18:53:02] <mikesherov> yeah, parseFloat is always base 10
[18:54:13] <mikesherov> I left some more comments
[18:55:51] <petro> what a petro
[18:56:01] <mikesherov> nah, it's good stuff
[18:56:13] <mikesherov> this fixes like 10 bugs
[18:56:13] <petro> changes pushed
[18:56:30] <petro> the "what a petro" was directed towards you ;)
[18:57:04] <petro> ah shit forgot one fallback
[18:57:27] <mikesherov> you're doing this: right: values[ 2 ] === "auto" ? outerWidth : parseFloat( values[ 2 ] ) || 0,
[18:57:50] <mikesherov> when you should be doing this: right: parseFloat( values[ 2 ] ) || outerWidth,
[18:58:10] <mikesherov> top: parseFloat( values[ 1 ] ) ,
[18:58:14] <petro> yeah that's much cleaner
[18:58:19] <mikesherov> should be: top: parseFloat( values[ 1 ] ) || 0,
[18:59:19] <petro> fixed and pushed
[18:59:26] <petro> (new commit)
[19:00:48] <petro> we need to take into account margin collapse when setting outerHeight
[19:01:34] <mikesherov> margin collapse is annoying
[19:02:07] <petro> very
[19:02:39] <mikesherov> I don't think createWrapper takes it into account either
[19:04:49] <petro> doesn't look like it
[19:05:04] <petro> with border-box, are margins never collapsed?
[19:05:15] <mikesherov> no, they are
[19:05:19] <mikesherov> OK, I'm issuing a pull request again you
[19:20:43] <mikesherov> petro: still there?
[19:21:01] <mikesherov> why is this necessary: el.outerWidth( el.outerWidth(true), true )
[19:21:14] <petro> ye
