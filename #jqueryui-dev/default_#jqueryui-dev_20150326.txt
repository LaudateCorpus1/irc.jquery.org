[05:03:41] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[05:04:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:04:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I found a problem in 1.5-stable. Redirect of some sequence tests breaks because of jQUery 2.1.3 ... I'm trying to figure out why.
[05:04:53] <arschmitz> git or 2.1.3?
[05:05:07] <gabriel_schulhof> The git stuff with transitions is a different problem.
[05:05:22] <arschmitz> because i think the transitions is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2129
[05:06:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1516
[05:06:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: those sequence tests have been driving me bonkers
[05:06:30] <arschmitz> i had them fixed
[05:06:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have no idea what's causing the redirect to fail.
[05:06:43] <arschmitz> then i borked a rebase and they came back and i cant for the life of me fix them again
[05:06:57] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and now, it seems, neither can I.
[05:07:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Might be phantomjs' fault.
[05:07:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: they were passing on ui-1-12
[05:07:23] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Was ui-1-12 using jquery 2.1.3?
[05:07:44] <arschmitz> i didnt change the browsers so it should be same
[05:08:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope.
[05:08:02] <arschmitz> i bet anything on git is the null attributes
[05:08:19] <gabriel_schulhof> In ui-1-12 external/jquery/jquery.js is 1.11.1
[05:08:29] <gabriel_schulhof> In 1.5-dev external/jquery/jquery.js is 2.1.3
[05:08:37] <arschmitz> how did that happen?
[05:08:56] <arschmitz> explains why diffs were not working though
[05:09:01] <arschmitz> also explains how i fixed it
[05:09:23] <arschmitz> it was probably before i rebased with master which changes our core dependency
[05:09:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: d49247b67cb7f178562270edc2d285bb32db4e67
[05:09:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaah, that was probably it!
[05:09:59] <arschmitz> yeah we landed a patch to fix our jquery dependencie on master
[05:10:11] <arschmitz> it was too specific before
[05:10:29] <gabriel_schulhof> It is extremely weird. No JS exceptions AFAICT, yet with core 2.1.3 the redirect fails.
[05:10:35] <arschmitz> so when i did updateDependencies for button it pulled it
[05:11:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: also im going to push a big change to our travis setup to 1.5-dev in a minute to test it out
[05:11:58] <arschmitz> taking out all the seperating of nav / unit / integration
[05:12:09] <arschmitz> just going to do a single run on each jQuery version
[05:12:17] <arschmitz> and then a single demos run after
[05:12:32] <arschmitz> should speed builds up A LOT
[05:12:34] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757#c146
[05:12:49] <mikesherov> Wow!
[05:12:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I already added the branch to .travis.yml to check whether the redirect error happens on travis as well.
[05:13:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im making it run on every branch
[05:13:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, yeah. That's pretty cool.
[05:13:23] <arschmitz> mikesherov: your late to the party :-)
[05:13:42] <arschmitz> mikesherov: were you under a rock yesterday :-p
[05:14:06] <mikesherov> I was working on a work deadline.
[05:14:15] <arschmitz> same thing
[05:14:16] <arschmitz> lol
[05:14:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Every branch?! That seems like a lot!
[05:14:20] <mikesherov> Apparently everyone already knows.
[05:14:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: why? why wouldnt we build any branch we push to?
[05:15:03] <arschmitz> thats what most do. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/.travis.yml
[05:15:12] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/.travis.yml
[05:15:41] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/pep/blob/master/.travis.yml
[05:15:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK.
[05:17:02] <gabriel_schulhof> I still have no idea what could be causing the redirect problem.
[05:17:12] <gabriel_schulhof> Does jQuery support phantomjs?
[05:17:14] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean core.
[05:18:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm trying to produce a test case that shows the redirect error, but I can't even get the console working.
[05:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yup, we played a large part in that decision :-)
[05:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> I told Rick that we're going to require Pointer Events for jQuery UI, which would put Chrome at a disadvantage by needing a polyfill to work with the most popular library.
[05:27:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/5d0a1bd489ed265ac31d
[05:30:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. WTF?! Now the redirect works fine.
[05:30:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I can see why this was driving you nuts.
[05:31:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The redirect doesn't work fine from grunt though, only from my simply phantom.js script ...
[05:32:09] <arschmitz> yeah its fine in browser too
[05:33:47] <gabriel_schulhof> *sigh* ... I can embark on a really long and winding road: bisect core from between the last 1.x release and 2.0.0 and see where it breaks.
[05:34:21] <gabriel_schulhof> For every stop along the git bisect I'd have to build core and then run this test.
[05:34:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we were passing on 2.1.x on travis for a long time
[05:34:49] <arschmitz> remember we check all versions on travis use that 
[05:36:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, wait!
[05:36:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We pass if you include http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.js
[05:36:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We do not pass with ../../../external/jquery/jquery.js
[05:36:55] <gabriel_schulhof> ... when the latter contains 2.1.3
[05:37:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wrap your head around that!
[05:37:02] <arschmitz> WHA?!?!?
[05:37:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[05:37:24] <arschmitz> run updateDependencies
[05:37:26] <arschmitz> and try 
[05:37:36] <arschmitz> that does not sound right
[05:38:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, but it is. I mean, I did wget -O - http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.js > external/jquery/jquery.js and it passes. I do the same with 2.1.3 and it fails.
[05:38:42] <gabriel_schulhof> But if I replace the reference in the script with http://... then it works.
[05:38:46] <gabriel_schulhof> It's insane!
[05:39:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Hence my suspicion that it's something to do with phantomjs.
[05:40:02] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, wait no.
[05:40:07] <gabriel_schulhof> If you do JQUERIES it also fails.
[05:40:21] <gabriel_schulhof> If you edit the script tag, then it works (or it worked - I'll try again).
[05:41:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i would maybe ask in #jquery i dont know thats nuts
[05:41:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/259ea66a221eb0266d05 "fixes" the redirect O_o
[05:42:54] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll ask after lunch.

[08:09:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm going to stop wondering why it's happening and I'm simply going to remove references to core and mobile from those two pages. After all, all they do is assign location.href. We can do that with plain JS.
[08:09:42] <arschmitz> ok
[08:10:01] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll copy the URL-parsing regex from navigation/path and parse the location with it.

[10:24:38] <hait> arschmitz: hi!
[10:25:45] <hait> arschmitz: I've written the proposal for the slider rewrite project. Can you just go through it once and suggest me any improvements or changes?
[10:54:14] <scott_gonzalez> hait: The first step is going to be API design.
[10:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> Code should also be written in a branch of the jQuery UI repo, so you can send a PR.
[10:55:01] <hait> scott_gonzalez: Oh. So the API has to designed first?
[10:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, that's always the first step.
[10:56:50] <hait> I talked to arschmitz once. He told that API can be developed at a later stage.
[10:57:24] <arschmitz> hait: i said the api did not need to be part of your proposal for GSoC
[10:57:29] <arschmitz> and hi im back now
[10:57:42] <arschmitz> it is always the first step in developing a widget
[10:58:13] <hait> which will start when one start working on the project right?
[10:58:27] <arschmitz> correct 
[10:59:01] <arschmitz> hait: did i give you the wiki template ofr widgets to start with?
[10:59:10] <hait> Yes.
[10:59:31] <hait> And I did start writing something
[10:59:37] <arschmitz> ok
[10:59:46] <hait> according to the template.
[11:01:26] <hait> Ok, I'll complete the API, but the application has to be submitted now.
[11:02:33] <hait> So can you have a look at the proposal, so that I can apply now and then get start with the API.
[11:06:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Are we having a meeting?
[11:06:18] <arschmitz> oh shoot yes sorry
[11:06:21] <arschmitz> time slipped away

[12:12:23] <kapil21051> gabriel_schulhof: Can't we trigger the popup/panel directly on pageshow without binding mobileinit ?
[12:13:26] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: Yes, of course, but if you bind to mobileinit, you must do so before you refer to jQuery Mobile, otherwise the handler will never run.
[12:15:26] <kapil21051> gabriel_schulhof: ohh okay
[12:16:18] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: So, in the case of your example, the popup's failure to show up is because the pageshow handler never gets attached, not because it gets attached, opens the popup, and then the popup immediately closes.
[12:17:11] <kapil21051> gabriel_schulhof: yeah i tried to directly attach the pageshow and it worked
[12:17:39] <kapil21051> means the problem is need to be resolved only for safari
[12:19:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes.
[12:19:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Exactly.
[12:20:18] <kapil21051> gabriel_schulhof: great then..
[12:21:32] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: We had a timeout somewhere to catch that initial popstate ...
[12:21:42] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: Maybe increasing that will make things work in Safari.
[12:21:48] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: I'm trying to find that code.
[12:22:21] <kapil21051>  gabriel_schulhof: me too
[12:26:14] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: OK, so we're no longer using a timeout, but we're using the fact that no navigation has happened yet (stack length is 1) to decide that the popstate is the initial popstate, rather than a valid popstate event.
[12:27:04] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/navigation/navigator.js#L181-L195
[12:28:01] <kapil21051>  gabriel_schulhof: yep..
[12:32:57] <kapil21051>  gabriel_schulhof: but how is it specifically related to safari
[12:33:35] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: Well, the popup receives a navigate event and closes.
[12:33:50] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil21051: I'm trying to figure out how that comes about and why it's not happening in Chrome.
[12:34:00] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll BBL.
[12:35:42] <kapil21051> okay
[14:17:56] <hait> arschmitz: hi
[14:18:30] <hait> arschmitz: your comment on my proposal. What exactly did you mean?
