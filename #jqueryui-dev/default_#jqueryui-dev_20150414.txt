[05:56:11] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:56:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[05:56:49] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Are elements untracked when they are removed?
[05:56:59] <arschmitz> no
[05:57:14] <arschmitz> if its a widget where that happens a lot you need to manually call remove class
[05:57:18] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, then I need to re-write the loader widget to use a lot less (read: no) .html()
[05:57:50] <arschmitz> `_removeClass` rather but yeah you get the idea
[06:00:17] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Another question that's come up while I was working on the navbar classes option ... there's code in there to remove the active button class in response to pagehide (#1181), but it's fairly useless, because the central vclick now always removes the active class anyway, so navbar can no longer be used for tracking which of the pages are currently active.
[06:00:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Should I try and fix that as part of the classes PR, or should I leave the bug in place and fix it as part of another PR?
[06:01:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cgack is already doing navbar
[06:01:08] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK ...
[06:01:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Then I'll drop the branch altogether.
[06:01:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hes also been doing the review 
[06:01:35] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, great!
[06:02:19] <arschmitz> he already has / had prs for both
[06:02:28] <arschmitz> but i think he didnt re open new one against 1.5-dev yet
[06:04:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Gah! This is bad "@VERSION DEMOS" :/
[06:07:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that should not be a big deal to fix
[06:07:44] <gabriel_schulhof> No, but it just caught my eye ...
[06:12:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, nm: .html() is fine, because there's no need to call ._addClass() on any of it.
[06:12:11] <gabriel_schulhof> So no leak.
[06:17:45] <Omar-> hi
[06:18:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Omar-: Hey!
[06:22:00] <Omar-> hi gabriel_schulhof how are you?

[08:37:13] <kapil21051> arschmitz : I was wondering why why we are not using translate3d on @moz-keyframes and @keyframes when we are using it on @webkit-keyframes

[08:37:55] <kapil21051> arschmitz: i think moz based browsers also support hardware acceleration using translate3d
[08:38:19] <arschmitz> ok
[08:38:47] <kapil21051> arschmitz : so should not it be changed ?
[08:39:02] <kapil21051> arschmitz : atleast till new transition module is developed 
[08:40:48] <arschmitz> kapil21051: im inclined not too change unless there is something this will actually help / fix at this point
[08:42:33] <kapil21051> arschmitz : well it will improve performance in mobile devices
[08:43:04] <arschmitz> have you found issues in firefox? im not aware of having any reported?
[08:43:09] <kapil21051> arschmitz : but there has not been any issues reported for transitions performance
[08:43:28] <kapil21051> arschmitz : no, not any but looking into it
[08:43:38] <arschmitz> kapil21051: well there are plenty about it but non on firefox i know of
[08:44:20] <kapil21051> arschmitz : ok..then we should leave it as it is
[08:44:43] <arschmitz> kapil21051: there are issues we have seen by using this
[08:45:00] <arschmitz> which is why im not inclined to do it just because
[08:45:43] <kapil21051> arschmitz : oh..ok..
[08:46:04] <kapil21051> arschmitz : maybe again some vendor conflicts

[11:51:00] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : ok..thanks :)
[11:59:02] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened pull request #8075: Loader: Add classes option (061.5-dev...067699-loader-classes-option) 02http://git.io/vvBar
[11:59:17] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: I'm curious if that couldn't be solved with an extension though ...
[11:59:44] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: When I first submitted popup to jQM, it was capable of supporting multiple popups, but it was difficult to manage the stack.
[12:01:06] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : when a popup is closed its history remains in the stack and when you will click on browser forward direction then the url will update to &ui-state=dialog but popup wont appear
[12:01:31] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: That's by design.
[12:02:04] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : and when u again open popup then ui-state=dialog gets appended to previous ui-state=dialog
[12:02:05] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: The idea is that the popup cannot be reached by navigating, but only by clicking on its link.
[12:02:44] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: Oh, really? I thought it was reusing it ... hmmm ... well, if it's not, it doesn't really matter, as long as it doesn't mess up the stack.
[12:02:47] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : so now there will be two ui-state=dialog..Isnt it wrong ?
[12:03:09] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: No, that's fine, unless it blows up the stack. That latter possibility is worth looking into.
[12:04:25] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: Reuse still works. 1. Go to http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/popup/ 2. Open the basic popup 3. Close it. 4. Click forward. 5. Open it.
[12:04:35] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: No new dialogHashKey gets appended to the hash.
[12:05:34] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : oh lemme check that
[12:05:59] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: If you refresh the page with the dialogHashKey still appended, then I think it will append a second one.
[12:06:33] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: Yeah - that was actually a major feat - dealing with the initial URL when it contains a dialogHashKey
[12:06:59] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : I was thinking what if we just remove the history assciated with the popup from the history stack when popup is closed
[12:07:15] <kapil2105> so that no forward option will present
[12:07:21] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: You can do that?
[12:07:53] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: What if there's a link in the popup that opens another page?
[12:08:47] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess if you could do that it would be cleaner than what we're doing now which is that, if you go back from the final page, it actually does an extra window.history.back() to go back two entries.
[12:09:17] <gabriel_schulhof> ... thus skipping over the stale popup entry.
[12:09:48] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: ... however, as long as we support IE8 we have to deal with the case where pushState is not available.
[12:10:27] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : 1. popup opens 2. link is clicked which means popup is being exited which will remove ui-state hashkey from the stack and loads the target page 3. so now the history contains only the url of the previous page from where the popup was opened
[12:10:44] <kapil2105> the role of popup shouldnt effect the history at all
[12:11:15] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: The reason why popup does any navigation at all is so you can dismiss the popup using the "Back" button.
[12:12:24] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: I thought about going back before navigating to the second page, but that's no simpler than skipping over stale popup entries, because in both cases you have to do an extra window.histoy.back().
[12:12:51] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: ... and we already have the skipping code in place and tested across several versions.
[12:13:24] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : hmm thats true..lets see if we can remove the hashkey from history when popup is closed or another link is opened from popup..
[12:14:41] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: If another link is opened from the popup, I'd leave it in place, because we already have code for skipping over it. If you want not to be able to go forward after closing the popup, that would be a new feature.
[12:15:30] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : cool..so can i start working on it ?
[12:15:55] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: Well, check with arschmitz first, because he knows the overall schedule.
[12:16:09] <arschmitz> whats up/
[12:16:10] <arschmitz> ?
[12:16:54] <kapil2105> arschmitz : we want to add a new feature which will remove the hashkey from history when popup is closed 
[12:17:08] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so you can't go forward to a stale history entry.
[12:17:32] <arschmitz> can you actually do that?
[12:17:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know, eh? I didn't know you could delete history entries.
[12:17:52] <arschmitz> can you?
[12:17:56] <kapil2105> arschmitz : hope so..
[12:18:01] <arschmitz> did you actually try in different browsers?
[12:18:29] <kapil2105> i would look into it and check if it can happen on all browsers
[12:18:37] <arschmitz> also why wouldnt we use replace state instead 
[12:19:39] <arschmitz> which is kinda what we do already but its all crazy because we still have not removed ios 4 support to allow proper use or push / replace
[12:19:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We /want/ the new history entry so you can use the back button to get out of the popup, but I guess it's kinda untidy that you can then go forward into the history entry and the popup does not reappear.
[12:20:00] <arschmitz> but has any one even tried this?
[12:20:33] <arschmitz> in any browser
[12:20:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I certainly haven't, but I haven't looked at the pushState API in sufficient detail to see whether it actually exposes functionality for /deleting/ a browser history entry.
[12:21:14] <gabriel_schulhof> I've mostly only looked at replaceState and pushState out of necessity.
[12:21:24] <arschmitz> why dont we talk about it after someone has actually looked at this
[12:22:20] <kapil2105> arschmitz : ok cool...
[12:22:33] <arschmitz> seems pointless to discuss something if its not posible
