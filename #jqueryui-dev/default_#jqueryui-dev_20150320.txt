[04:36:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping! 
[04:47:11] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I've got API docs for you to review!
[04:47:44] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I accidentally reviewed some of the new button PR as well, while I was compiling the full list of classes defaults; I'll review more of that now
[04:48:52] <arschmitz> accidentally? lol
[04:49:04] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: how does that work :-)
[04:50:33] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: well, I was looking for stuff to write docs, then noticed some things that I ended up commenting on...
[04:51:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: thats cool 
[04:52:28] <jzaefferer> since I started working on the classes docs, even more emails piled up in my jquery label, now at 74 unread, of 107 total :/
[04:52:43] <jzaefferer> and I already deleted some of the trac spam notifications...
[04:52:52] <arschmitz> when your on most or all of the repos that happens fast
[04:54:21] <jzaefferer> well, I try to unwatch/unsubscribe from anything I can't/don't contribute to; lots going on on UI, Globalize and QUnit, plus GSoC proposals...
[04:54:27] <jzaefferer> anyway, button PR!
[05:20:58] <agcolom> arschmitz: http://jqueryuk.com/2015/videos.php?s=getting-started-with-jquery-mobile 
[05:29:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: ill check it out
[05:29:54] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[05:40:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:41:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/1.5-dev
[05:45:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Is that onto which I'm supposed to rebase all my classes PRs?
[05:45:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: I think that would make sense 
[05:45:31] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:45:32] <arschmitz> its ui-1-12 but all cleaned up and shiny lol
[05:45:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Gotcha. Tests green, I presume?
[05:45:50] <arschmitz> yup
[05:45:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Nice!
[05:46:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Can do.
[06:17:20] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For the boilerplate, does each module need to return what it defines? I've been adding return statements so far, because that's what UI does.
[06:18:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes in the widgets it should just be return $.widget( "mobile.toolbar", $.mobile.toolbar, { ...
[06:18:13] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[06:18:15] <arschmitz> the factory returns the constructor
[06:18:31] <arschmitz> lol that was my first commit to ui i think
[06:19:38] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[06:19:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Fun times ...
[06:29:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Our demos are version specific. Can I use @VERSION in a URL? i.e.: //>>demos: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/@VERSION/toolbar/
[06:29:17] <gabriel_schulhof> ?
[06:33:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what do you mean exactly?
[06:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[06:34:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What is to be the value of our //>>demos: metadata field?
[06:35:24] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We need a URL that points to a demo of the module being defined.
[06:35:40] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: But all our demos are located at URLs which contain the version of the library in their path.
[06:36:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: For example, http://demos.jquerymobile.com/popup/ redirects to http://demos.jquerymobile.com/popup/1.4.5, which is a redirect loop.
[06:37:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I have no choice but to give http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/popup/ as the value of //>>demos:
[06:37:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but then I don't want to hardcode the version, so I'd like to use the handy-dandy @VERSION variable that is present at the very top of the markup.
[06:38:06] <gabriel_schulhof> Unfortunately, I'm not sure whether that variable is replaced everywhere and is thus safe to use, or whether it's only replaced in the toplevel /* ... */ comment.
[06:38:56] <gabriel_schulhof> So far I've been adding it because my only alternative is to add the version (1.4.5) explicitly and then have to rewrite the files for every release.
[06:39:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it is
[06:39:50] <arschmitz> in ui its also a prop on the widget
[06:39:58] <arschmitz> which we should start doing BTW
[06:40:32] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, great. So, //>>demos: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/@VERSION/widgetname/ it is ... :+1:
[06:41:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im pretty sure we are already handling the @version replacment in the gruntfile but we should double check to make sure of that
[06:42:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh i guess we are only doing it on the actual ui widgets right now
[06:42:53] <arschmitz> we will have to add that as part of the build task
[06:43:06] <arschmitz> or dist rather
[06:43:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and to index.php ...
[06:45:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: nah demos on view are ok to show @ version
[06:45:58] <arschmitz> only the built demos matter which use the built min file
[06:46:13] <arschmitz> which would have it replaced already by the dist task
[06:46:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: If @VERSION appears in JS code it causes a syntax error.
[06:46:32] <gabriel_schulhof> That's why I mentioned index.php
[06:46:49] <gabriel_schulhof> index.php simply concats the files in js/
[06:47:13] <gabriel_schulhof> So, if @VERSION appears in the JS portion as well as the comments, that'll cause a syntax error at least locally.
[06:47:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: it should be a string
[06:47:40] <arschmitz> "@VERSION"
[06:47:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, right, in that case it's OK.
[06:48:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Though aesthetically not so much ...
[06:48:22] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/button.js#L63
[06:48:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/demos/button/default.html#L10
[06:48:51] <gabriel_schulhof> OK ... do you want me to add this as part of the current boilerplate pass?
[06:48:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sure
[06:49:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Also, should I add it to things-other-than-widgets as well, like $.mobile.navigate(), and $.mobile.Navigator?
[06:50:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Basically, I'd try to add it to all modules, whether they define widgets or whether they define other types of objects.
[06:50:12] <arschmitz> it should be on $.ui as well
[06:50:36] <arschmitz> probably not on the micro modules
[06:50:45] <gabriel_schulhof> micro modules?
[06:51:01] <arschmitz> things that are not a "thing" them selves
[06:51:03] <arschmitz> like helps
[06:51:04] <arschmitz> data
[06:51:05] <arschmitz> etc
[06:51:23] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, that's basically ns.
[06:51:43] <gabriel_schulhof> $.mobile = { version: "@VERSION" };
[06:51:50] <arschmitz> yup
[06:51:54] <gabriel_schulhof> ... instead of the current $.mobile = {};
[06:52:13] <arschmitz> looking at ui they dont add it to things like position
[06:52:39] <arschmitz> so i guess that would be fairly equivilent to navigate
[06:52:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah - sounds like anything non-widget.
[06:53:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ... which is kinda weird - I mean, what makes widgets special in that sense? We should version everything.
[06:53:28] <arschmitz> well there are not great examples in ui
[06:53:54] <arschmitz> they dont have much thats not widgets position is about it because effects is an extension of core
[06:54:07] <gabriel_schulhof> OTOH, everything will be hanging off of $.mobile, and $.mobile /is/ versioned ... and it's not like we don't do globals if the return value of the module is used. We still do globals.
[06:54:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: heh but consider this
[06:54:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: if you check @version of tabs
[06:54:53] <arschmitz> it will be the ui not the mobile version
[06:55:04] <arschmitz> we replace those when they are copied
[06:55:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, yeah ... tabs has an extension in mobile, so we can overwrite the version there.
[06:56:02] <arschmitz> but we shouldnt
[06:56:12] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Then I won't. *wipe hands*
[06:56:16] <arschmitz> it should be the ui version 
[06:57:13] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, so, bottom line: Only ns and widgets, but not UI widgets get the version. Correct?
[06:57:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but the point i was getting to is it might make sense to add to anything thats a stand along
[06:58:09] <gabriel_schulhof> I think we need to think seriously about stuff we want in modules but not visible from DB.
[06:58:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Like navigate() and History, and Navigator.
[06:58:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes this came up in the ui one recently
[06:58:39] <arschmitz> the ability to hide a module
[06:58:43] <gabriel_schulhof> I encountered //>>group: exclude in some of our modules
[06:58:52] <gabriel_schulhof> I think that's not bad.
[06:59:16] <arschmitz> open a ticket on ui download build if there is not one
[06:59:27] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[07:01:56] <gabriel_schulhof> Weird ... there're a lot of theme roller related issues ...
[07:04:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/
[07:06:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: themeroller and downloadbuilder on ui play nice together
[07:06:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Right, that's where I was looking.
[07:06:52] <arschmitz> you can paste a link from themeroller into download builder
[07:07:02] <arschmitz> and get your custom download + custom theme build

[07:13:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't think I'm going to version extensions (like reflow and columntoggle) for example - no point overwriting the version with itself ...
[07:14:04] <arschmitz> no they should not be
[07:14:08] <arschmitz> only stand alone modules
[07:14:20] <arschmitz> extensions should never have a version
[07:14:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[07:14:32] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
