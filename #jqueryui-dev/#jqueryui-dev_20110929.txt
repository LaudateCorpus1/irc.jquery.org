[04:30:06] <darkangel> Hi, when is version 1.9 scheduled for release?
[04:35:52] <rdworth> we don't set a scheduled date, we release it when it's ready. You can see what's left before that will be the case on the roadmap http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[04:35:55] <rdworth> months away
[05:06:43] <darkangel> rworth: :( Okay, thanks for the info.
[08:41:28] <rpflo> Hmm, I'm trying to extend datepicker and can't
[08:41:33] <rpflo> the constructor isn't exposed anywhere
[08:42:02] <rpflo> and you can't do it the normal jQuery.widget('rf.datepicker', jQuery.ui.datepicker, {})
[08:42:20] <rpflo> because jQuery.ui.datepicker isn't a constructor, because it's not created with .widget.
[08:46:26] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez ^, when you've got some time, would love to know if there's a way to do this, meanwhile I'm pouring over the source to find an extension point.
[08:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: can't help you
[08:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> datepicker is being rewritten from scratch
[08:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/datepicker/datepicker-rewrite
[08:49:05] * kborchers hides when he hears datepicker and extend in the same sentence ;)
[08:53:04] <rpflo> kborchers: event tracking, way easier to extend the widgets, then add a pile of events all over the place.
[08:55:03] <kborchers> but as i'm sure you've seen, the current datepicker source is ... well ... not so friendly to the eye
[08:56:10] <rpflo> I just realized its essentially a singleton, exposed at jQuery.datepicker.
[08:59:46] <rpflo> Is there a roadmap for 1.9? Release date target?
[09:08:19] <kborchers> I don't think I have heard a specific target date. I know we are just working our asses off on it http://wiki.jqueryui.com/  scott_gonzalez? ^^
[09:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[09:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> no target date
[09:14:31] <rpflo> Your work does not go unappreciated :)
[09:16:45] <effekt> hello there
[09:17:11] <effekt> I'm about to submit a pull request for menubar, but unsure if the code I stripped had any reasoning behind it
[09:17:44] <effekt> jquery.ui.menubar.js:126 - binds to mouseleave events calling a close timer, then binds to mouseenter events cancelling it
[09:17:58] <effekt> since menu stops propagation of ui-menu-item mouse events, it won't function
[09:18:11] <effekt> (only does because there's a 2px padding on the menu ..if you move your mouse to fast or remove it, it pops)
[09:19:13] <effekt> oh wait, that's a perfect moment to try out the blame functionality on github
[09:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> effekt: it was likely written by jzaefferer
[09:20:16] <effekt> nah, it's a patch by kborchers that added the autoExpand
[09:20:29] <effekt> doesn't look like there was any reasoning to his approach
[09:20:35] <effekt> so I'll just send the pull request
[09:21:18] <effekt> scott_gonzalez: is it desired that such things are documented in comments around the codebase?
[09:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> only if they're non-obvious
[09:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> it seems very obvious what that's trying to accomplish
[09:22:23] <effekt> not so obvious that what he did doesn't work because of the propagation stop in menu tho
[09:22:38] <effekt> but a good commit message should suffice
[09:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> if it doesn't work, it's either unnecessary or broken
[09:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> either way, a comment wouldn't help
[09:34:27] <kborchers> effekt: i see the issue you are talking about. now that menu is pretty much finished, menubar is next on my list. it needs a lot of work since there were many changes to menu including the ability to use structures other than just ul/li which menubar currently relies on
[09:34:40] <effekt> kborchers: already submitted the pull request
[09:35:08] <effekt> I'd be happy to help on other issues too because I plan on actually using it right now
[09:35:48] <effekt> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/477
[09:37:03] <effekt> I went with a rather pragmatic nested approach until I started putting in jquery-ui again
[09:37:27] <effekt> utilizing only CSS
[10:04:28] <effekt> kborchers: saw the _bind call just now - that'd be preferable, yes
[10:05:02] <effekt> wish I could just change my pull request to that
[10:39:45] <gnarf> so kborchers https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/477/files looks good then?
[10:40:23] <gnarf> do we have any test coverage on that?
[10:59:44] <gnarf> kborchers: if you want to pull that in, I can give you the tips on how to handle pulling with squash, etc
[10:59:52] <gnarf> dunno if you already got that walkthrough from anyone else
[11:20:17] <gnarf> kborchers: when are you arriving in bos?
[11:34:51] <Tmorrish> anyone else having issues with Datepicker and Firefox 7
[12:02:09] <kborchers> gnarf: sorry was in a meeting
[12:05:18] <gnarf> kborchers: np
[12:05:20] <gnarf> I'm back now too
[12:05:22] <gnarf> just walked over to Filament group to say hi to toddparker et all :)
[12:06:32] <kborchers> cool, i get into Boston at 10:30. was planning on doing a little site seeing then having lunch with jzaefferer around 2 before the testing meeting. i'm sure you can join us if you don't have plans, unless jzaefferer wants me all to himself ;)
[12:08:05] <kborchers> gnarf: as for that pull, i am about to just push the changes myself to my repo then maybe you could take a look and if ok, help me with my first merge into master :)
[12:08:20] <gnarf> kborchers: :)
[12:08:29] <gnarf> yeah, should be here for ~30-45
[12:08:38] <kborchers> ok, just a sec
[12:09:53] <kborchers> gnarf: here is the commit https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/commit/e35990eeb955a46062fb799c541939f3f74130d7
[12:09:54] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (1m, 12s ago): Menubar: Fixed an issue with autoExpand binding that caused the menu to close on fast mouseenter by changing to _bind on the parent menubar item
[12:10:08] <gnarf> so, is that just a squash?
[12:10:36] <kborchers> honestly, don't know what that means
[12:10:58] <gnarf> heh
[12:11:04] <gnarf> how did you get that commit in your build?
[12:11:36] <gnarf> kborchers: so, there is like a little intro doc here on how to do pull merging http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull%20Requests
[12:12:05] <kborchers> branched from master after merging upstream so should be up to date then just pushed that branch to my repo
[12:12:13] <gnarf> yeah
[12:12:45] <gnarf> so, "merging" a pull is pretty simple
[12:12:50] <gnarf> first you want to add the "remote"
[12:13:35] <gnarf> so in this case
[12:13:58] <gnarf> git remove add fx git://github.com/fx/jquery-ui.git
[12:14:02] <gnarf> git remote *
[12:14:13] <gnarf> then you want to "fetch" his repo
[12:14:20] <gnarf> (which you can do with git remote add -f
[12:14:26] <gnarf> but git fetch fx works too
[12:14:34] <kborchers> this is from my repo but i get the idea ... not using his
[12:14:50] <gnarf> is there a reason to use yours over his?
[12:15:18] <kborchers> changed mine to use _bind
[12:15:29] <gnarf> okays
[12:15:46] <gnarf> so is that commit of yours on master?
[12:15:52] <gnarf> or on a branch?
[12:16:01] <kborchers> a branch
[12:16:14] <gnarf> cool, switch back to master
[12:16:30] <gnarf> git pull upstream master ; git cherry-pick e35990eeb955a46062fb799c541939f3f74130d7 ; git push upstream master
[12:16:32] <gnarf> and you should be done
[12:16:45] <gnarf> you can also "merge" if its a fastforward
[12:16:50] <gnarf> git merge branchname
[12:16:54] <gnarf> instead of the cherry-pick
[12:17:00] <gnarf> but the idea is to avoid having "merge commits" in the log
[12:17:24] <kborchers> ok here goes, just a sec
[12:17:41] <gnarf> also, i really hope your master is fresh ;)
[12:18:32] <kborchers> it should be. i just did git fetch upstream ; git merge upstream/master before the branch
[12:18:57] <gnarf> you can FORCE it to be freshest with git fetch upstream ; git reset --hard upstream/master
[12:19:12] <kborchers> oh, ok
[12:19:28] <gnarf> that makes absolutely sure your master is 100% identical to upstream/master
[12:19:53] <kborchers> would you recommend i do that then re-branch and redo my changes to be safe?
[12:20:11] <gnarf> nah, cherry-pick grabs a single commit
[12:20:17] <gnarf> none of its parents
[12:20:18] <gnarf> so like
[12:20:18] <kborchers> ok
[12:20:26] <gnarf> if you reset master and cherry-pick your commit its cool
[12:21:04] <gnarf> also, I'd like to request you work on a test case to cover this
[12:21:26] <gnarf> you can do it after pushing the change, but really, untested code is dangerous
[12:21:45] <kborchers> ok, visually tested it looks ok but i get what you're saying
[12:21:49] <kborchers> will do
[12:22:17] <gnarf> yeah, the visual test is good nuff to make it into master, but you really should be pusing a unit
[12:24:36] <kborchers> i think that did it!
[12:24:54] <gnarf> you pushed upstream?
[12:24:59] <kborchers> yep
[12:25:00] * gnarf waits for the commit bot
[12:25:23] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/ac8a19b62d89a5b70b8ef89029ff81cdf889cf41 seems like it worked
[12:25:24] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (1m, 58s ago): Menubar: Fixed an issue with autoExpand binding that caused the menu to close on fast mouseenter by changing to _bind on the parent menubar item
[12:25:38] <gnarf> dunno why the commit bot hasn't arrived yet
[12:26:06] <gnarf> so, leave a message on the pull request something along the lines of "landed discussed changes in SHA" and close it
[12:26:06] <gnarf> :)
[12:26:17] <gnarf> kborchers: some notes....
[12:26:25] <gnarf> cherry-pick -x
[12:26:31] <gnarf> will leave a link to the "parent" commit
[12:26:46] <gnarf> so we use that if the fix is getting applied to 1.8-stable too
[12:27:02] <kborchers> oh, ok. good to know
[12:28:35] <gnarf> you cherry-pick -x the SHA from master -> 1.8-stable
[12:28:59] <gnarf> that wiki page i linked earlier has a bunch of tips for checking out / testing remotes too
[12:29:18] <kborchers> gotcha. thanks
[12:32:33] <kborchers> gnarf: so you want to join our late lunch tomorrow. assuming we're just meeting in the hotel lobby or something.
[12:33:10] <gnarf> kborchers: I'll prolly be at the loft
[12:33:22] <gnarf> kborchers: but i think i need to stop at the hotel to checkin anyway
[12:33:29] <gnarf> so yeah
[12:33:39] <gnarf> 815.505.4487 if you wanna like text me when you get in or whatev
[12:33:55] <kborchers> ok
[12:34:16] <kborchers> you know your number is in the logs now for all to see
[12:36:06] <kborchers> so you helping out with that training at the loft?
[12:37:10] <gnarf> im gonna be "watching"
[12:37:28] <kborchers> cool
[12:38:07] <kborchers> ok, gotta grab some lunch finally.
[15:19:12] <effekt> kborchers stole my codez, I want vengeance!
[15:23:18] <effekt> also, gnarf: how would you go about testing my change there? is there some magic way to automate things like that?
[15:23:53] <effekt> as I described in the pull request - if you left the 2px padding that are in the base theme, a usual slow mouse movement would trigger the timer cancel just fine
[15:25:00] <effekt> I sure can't think of any efficient way to automate tests like that tho
[15:36:30] <gnarf> effekt: simulate mouse events
