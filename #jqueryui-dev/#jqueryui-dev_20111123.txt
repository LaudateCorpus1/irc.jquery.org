[08:19:42] <michelled> jzaefferer: hi there - are we planning on meeting today?
[08:31:53] <jzaefferer> hey michelled, the regular UI meeting is in half an hour, in #jquery-meeting
[08:32:05] <jzaefferer> can also hop on Skype, though didn't have anything in my calendar
[08:56:01] <mikesherov> I'm over here now :-)
[08:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> it's a bug that needs to be fixed
[08:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> but my real opinion is that users should just set maxHeight
[08:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> or even just height on known tall dialogs
[08:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> having a dialog taller than the window is horrible UX
[08:58:30] <mikesherov> yeah, at the moment, that's not our implementation :-\
[08:59:43] <mikesherov> so should I just hack around it, or is there a chance this might get fixed officially in a reasonable amount of work
[09:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> hopefully this will be fixed in 1.9
[09:00:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be working on the redesign for dialog soon
[09:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> there are a few things related to modal and overlay that need to happen

[09:42:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: moving testing notes over here. i also found that i think in all browsers, the containment option for draggable is not working right ... probably because of the title div in the containment element. the size is constrained appropriately but because of the other element it resizes outside of the containment element
[10:03:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: have to go for now ... i'll keep testing later and let you know if i find anything
[10:07:21] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, where is this commit? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e11efb37dfc525a4e84e1bc6b276f7dc74f12bd4
[10:07:22] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (3w, 1d ago): Menu: Change focus handling to preventDefault on mousedown but then focus menu on click to fix issues with long click showing the first element being focused during click and also with Autocomplete. Also, moved the bindings into _bind.

[10:41:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Autocomplete: Making sure we do not show search menu after a blur. Fixed #7423 - Tab out of autocomplete with remote source can leave menu showing. - Shannon
[10:59:54] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: I tested 1-8-stable demos in chrome, only found issues with the runner
[11:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> did the runner start working after you ran it individually?
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> I find it really hard to get Chrome not to use cached files in the runner
[11:08:19] <rworth> nope
[11:08:52] <rworth> and it's such a *good* runner ;)

[14:20:47] <kborchers> jzaefferer: hmm, weird i'm not sure where that commit went. must have gotten lost somewhere along the line and it does look necessary. i'll work it back in and test to make sure there wasn't a reason for removing it
[14:25:37] <jzaefferer> kborchers: thanks, would be nice if that addresses the issue we're seeing
[15:36:09] <clarkbox> hey... will widgets like autocomplete ever use popup for the drop down functionality? i assume its not using popup because it was not available till recently?

[21:44:16] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez Opera 11 on 1-8-stable looks good other than a few things I found that also don't work in the current demos so nothing new is broken
[21:44:21] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[22:27:44] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez Safari is all good on 1-8-stable except tabs unit test #30 fails but it was failing in the last version too
[22:27:45] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
