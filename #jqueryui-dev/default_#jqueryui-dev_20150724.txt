[02:15:16] <kiwaz> Hey everybody.
[02:15:34] <kiwaz> I cannot login to the jQuery UI (not github) bug tracker it seems
[02:15:41] <kiwaz> though I'm 100% sure my pass is correct
[02:15:45] <kiwaz> it just seems to time out
[02:43:14] <arthurvr> Hey kiwaz
[02:43:31] <arthurvr> â€¦ and then he left.

[04:18:47] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes
[04:19:14] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: jasper figured out how to do it with just css and no extra classes and still support ie8
[04:34:41] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Correct me if I'm wrong: If we remove page's dependency on enhancer.backcompat, we have to update all the tests to use "ui-" instead of "nstest-", right?
[05:00:58] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: thats why i said we cant do that
[05:01:17] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: and why we had a whole talk yesterday about how it needed to be part of they asyncLoad
[05:04:10] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: sounds good. This is going "back" into Chassis as well?
[05:04:51] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: well chassis never had a soan
[05:04:52] <arschmitz> span
[05:05:07] <arschmitz> chassis does not even technically have buttons with icons yet
[05:05:14] <arschmitz> and they are still in line
[05:05:25] <arschmitz> the span was only for being able to handle with JS 
[05:06:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: also chassie does not support IE8 so they can use last-child if they want to handle this a bit better then we can
[05:07:19] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: this is something thats always likely to be handled *slightly* different by us then in a pure css approach because its hard to manage an actual space character
[05:10:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the main thing is that our icons inline not absolute
[05:10:25] <arschmitz> which this does not change
[05:22:29] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Sorry! It's just that, a supported module should never depend on a backcompat module.
[05:22:38] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: We shouldn't ship 1.5.0 that way.
[05:22:47] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i dont think your understanding
[05:23:01] <arschmitz> this needs to be fixed in the async loader
[05:23:11] <arschmitz> before we can remove it from page
[05:23:32] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Someone is already working on this
[05:23:59] <arschmitz> and has a POC upgrading all our tests to use AMD and a smart bootstrap to do all the loading and handle backcompat 
[05:24:16] <arschmitz> just like we talked about yesterday :-)
[05:24:42] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Right, OK. Either way, after moving popup to data-ui-*, I started thinking that maybe we need to do a pass over all the tests and move everything to data-ui-*
[05:26:50] <arschmitz> no
[05:26:58] <arschmitz> thats the whole point we should not
[05:27:17] <arschmitz> the default build will still have $.mobile.ns
[05:27:25] <gabrielschulhof> Why not? We will no longer support anything other than data-ui-* in the future, right?
[05:27:34] <arschmitz> and only setting $.mobilebackcompat to false will change that
[05:27:57] <gabrielschulhof> Why shouldn't our non-backcompat tests reflect our future setup?
[05:28:07] <arschmitz> because real life does not
[05:28:39] <arschmitz> if you put the lib in a page by it self it will use $.mobile.ns
[05:28:59] <arschmitz> thats why we have seperate backcompat pages
[05:29:30] <gabrielschulhof> Well, OK, I suppose we can do this pass over the tests for 1.6.0 ...
[05:29:43] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: most of them will get it now
[05:29:49] <arschmitz> because anything with backcompat has to
[05:30:50] <arschmitz> and technically anything using the ns SHOULD have both a normal and backcompat test
[05:30:57] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah.
[05:31:14] <arschmitz> but thats not top priority right now
[05:31:24] <gabrielschulhof> The thing is, I shouldn't have to set $.mobileBackcompat to false in tests that use requirejs and do not load backcompatModules.
[05:31:33] <gabrielschulhof> non-backcompat tests.
[05:32:46] <arschmitz> yes you should
[05:33:08] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, because sometimes the backcompat is not isolate to a file I can omit including.
[05:33:41] <gabrielschulhof> But when all I include is files which do not contain checks for $.mobileBackcompat, I shouldn't need to define it.
[05:33:59] <arschmitz> you dont?
[05:34:03] <gabrielschulhof> Nope.
[05:34:16] <arschmitz> no what im saying is you dont need to
[05:34:19] <gabrielschulhof> In non-backcompat tests, I include nothing that has if ( $.mobileBackcompat !== false )
[05:34:26] <arschmitz> but if you include page its going to happen
[05:34:30] <gabrielschulhof> Exactly.
[05:34:36] <gabrielschulhof> page is the only exception.
[05:34:36] <arschmitz> and that needs to be that way
[05:35:10] <arschmitz> because if you make it the other way
[05:35:26] <arschmitz> unless you actually add a backcompat version of every test page
[05:35:47] <arschmitz> you are not testing whats actually going to be on the cdn and 95% of people using
[05:37:40] <gabrielschulhof> Well, I guess 95% of people will be using data- and neither data-nstest- nor data-ui-. So, we're not testing what 95% of people are using even now.
[05:38:09] <gabrielschulhof> We intentionally add nstest- in the tests to make sure nstest- is respected everywhere, but nobody actually uses it.
[05:38:12] <gabrielschulhof> AFAIK.
[05:40:28] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: In other news, that line in h2widget is not what's causing the popup to close.
[05:41:03] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I now share your original suspicion: That navigation events in the iframe are not isolated to the iframe.
[05:41:46] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: well actually "" is not different then "nstest-"
[05:41:57] <arschmitz> its just a different one
[05:42:23] <arschmitz> so id be just as happy replacing "nstest-" with "" for 1.5
[05:42:40] <arschmitz> the point is its a non default one what ever it is
[05:43:07] <arschmitz> the point before was nstest- was not the default
[05:43:31] <arschmitz> now neither "nstest-" nor "" are the default
[05:44:06] <arschmitz> in 1.6 this becomes static so we dont need to test it at all any more
[05:45:24] <arschmitz> and for 1.5 95% of people will be using a non default
[05:45:36] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, so I guess it's gone from default to non-default.
[05:45:44] <arschmitz> yup
[05:46:17] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: did you see my PR for the page hiding and autogrow?
[05:47:00] <gabrielschulhof> Not yet. I've been fixing popup wrt. ui- and the Windows issue and now the iOS issue.
[05:47:53] <arschmitz> ok

[07:18:40] <gabrielschulhof> It's definitely about the iframe though. The behaviour is similar to the initial popstate situation, but we're handling that, I think.
