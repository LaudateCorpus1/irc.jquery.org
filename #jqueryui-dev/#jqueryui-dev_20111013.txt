[05:22:33] <jzaefferer> gnarf: timepicker review once you're up and running, let rworth and me know when we can start
[06:08:51] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yt?
[06:09:48] <jzaefferer> kborchers: here
[06:10:04] <kborchers> any thoughts on this guy obsession over the menu delay?
[06:11:03] <kborchers> i think it's fine the way it is ... i think it's the same interaction as the OSX menu system
[06:11:29] <kborchers> i guess we could make the delay an option
[06:20:16] <kborchers> so looking at menu we did lose the delay somewhere along the way ... i'll fix it and comment
[08:12:40] <gnarf> jzaefferer / rworth seems i am yet again running late, was totally unable to fall asleep last night til like an hour before you sent that message asking when to start
[08:29:43] <jzaefferer> gnarf: you've seen Fight Club?
[08:29:49] <gnarf> yup
[08:30:10] <jzaefferer> are you sure you "couldn't sleep"?
[08:30:34] <gnarf> i might of been out doing something else, but i'm pretty sure i was conciously watching voyager reruns
[08:31:35] <jzaefferer> so you slept 4 hrs?
[08:39:37] <gnarf> 5 i think
[08:39:49] <gnarf> >maybe< 6

[13:59:18] <gnarf> im going to be submitting a patch that introduces a bug
[13:59:53] <gnarf> scale/size/etc will no longer support leaving the element in positioning other than top/left
[14:00:32] <gnarf> my reasoning: since i can't reliably detect if bottom/right are being used, i should assume top/left always?
[14:00:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, kborchers, rworth - any thoughts?
[14:07:57] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/f0c45f6fd04b7775d45b06756229b48172723288
[14:07:58] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by gnarf37 (1m, 39s ago): Scale: We can't detect this reliably currently, so assume all elements are positioned with left and top
[15:38:48] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: heyo
