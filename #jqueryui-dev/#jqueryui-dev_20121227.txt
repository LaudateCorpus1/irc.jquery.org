[05:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: What do you mean by "same file structure"?
[05:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> Also, what complexity are we able to avoid adding?
[05:44:07] <rxaviers> 1.10.0 has dropped some 1.9.0 files (external libs), and added a different image.
[05:44:37] <rxaviers> 1.9.0 builder unit test checks for 1.9 files and complains about that.
[05:44:59] <rxaviers> Or we skip testing it, or update unit test. I've updade it.
[05:45:42] <rxaviers> complexity = add conditional checks on version to decide what file differences it should consider.
[05:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'm fine landing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/868
[05:46:40] <rxaviers> Instead of messing unit test with those checks, I've simply created another unit test for legacy (1.9) and the default for 1.10
[05:47:04] <rxaviers> (and updated* the default for 1.10)
[05:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> Are you talking about complexity in the tests or complexity in the actual code?
[05:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see how we would get rid of the complexity in the code.
[05:47:42] <rxaviers> in tests, nothing needed to change in builder
[05:48:15] <rxaviers> As soon as download builder serves stable and legacy with the exact same structure, we are able to drop legacy builder unit test.
[05:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, we can't assume that externals will ever become consistent.
[05:48:41] <rxaviers> Builder is still just one. Tests are two
[05:49:06] <jzaefferer> hey rxaviers, just did some DB/TR testing
[05:49:15] <jzaefferer> see my two emails...
[05:49:23] <rxaviers> consistent across different versions or within the same version?
[05:50:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, push state is a long story.
[05:51:22] <rxaviers> it's not cross compliant. As far as I know, there are some projects trying to workaround that. like History (caps H)
[05:54:00] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, when should DB be ready for multi-versions?
[05:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ideally by next week.
[05:54:26] <rxaviers> I thought it was for like last week
[05:54:28] <rxaviers> ok
[05:54:37] <rxaviers> It means, it needs to be ready for 1.11 right?
[05:55:34] <rxaviers> 1.10
[05:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I was hoping it be done in 2012 :-P
[05:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> But if it's done by next week, that's fine.
[05:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> The goal is to release in January.
[05:57:18] <rxaviers> cool ok
[05:57:36] <rxaviers> So, I wanna make sure it works for 1.10.0pre
[05:57:40] <rxaviers> first
[05:57:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, whoa.
[05:57:51] <rxaviers> Im doing that this week
[05:58:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think Drupal may have dropped the ball on D8.
[05:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> Code Freeze is now July 2013 o_O
[05:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> They're Feature Complete on Feb 1.
[05:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> I believe it was Feb 1, 2013 when we set our roadmap.
[06:00:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, but, I do agree we should use push state for newer browsers. It's much more elegant than using hash. (of course, falling back to hash for old browsers anyway)
[06:03:30] <rxaviers> If you guys agree, first I wanna put multi version on stage (master and 1.9). Test if everything works. Fix every minor bugs (including jorn styles hints for the links). Make that stable. Then, make a push state branch.
[06:05:58] <rxaviers> otherwise we'll have a broken stuff for next week
[06:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> Let's hold off on pushState.
[06:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> I agree pushState is better, but I'd rather fix all bugs first.
[06:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> And with the switch to new-css, we're going to need to change styles.
[06:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: If you checkout the new-css branch in web-base-template and jqueryui.com, you can see what's going on.
[06:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> We're hoping to get new-css live in a few weeks.
[06:10:57] <rxaviers> ok
[06:18:17] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI build #902: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/902/
[06:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's looking like I won't get to the grunt 0.4 review until next week.
[06:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> Starting on the API site styling right now and I think that's gonna be a lot of work.
[06:42:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay, so no pushStage for now
[06:43:36] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can we soft-launch DB once our own testing on stage is cool? Means we'll get feedback from regular downloads, which would be preferable to release day
[06:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Sure, once we think it's stable, we can deploy.
[06:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> Worst case we just re-deploy an old version if there are problems.
[06:44:13] <jzaefferer> would be multi-version support with just one version for now
[06:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> right
[06:44:21] <rxaviers> hehe
[06:44:37] <rxaviers> interesting
[06:46:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, will let you know when it's ready
[06:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a function that determines if you're on a listing page?
[06:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> Something like is_archive() || is_search() || is_category() || is_whateverelse()
[06:48:50] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: is_archive() includes all date, author, and taxonomy archives. so, you're looking for is_archive() || is_search()
[06:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok, thanks

[08:12:03] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: regarding DB unit tests: as long as the code just copies all files from the externals dir (not specific files), there's no need to explicilty check each file. That would avoid some of the issue.

[08:46:43] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, yeap, I could skip the tests. But, I think the approach I took was quite simple and we dont lose coverage. https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/commit/a89634c838242f90432498eac086f4045e246ab1
[08:47:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I gave a quick look at your pushState lib. I enjoyed your purpose. Will read better soon. PS: I agree History is a beast. Too much code.
[08:48:43] <rxaviers> another lib that implements History is backbone. I remember its implementation was very simple. But, I am afraid it simply ignores the differences.

[12:00:46] <rxaviers> Guys, help? If I listen to keyup, change this.value = ... (or by using $(this).val(...)). I don't get the change event. How can I change this.value while keeping the change event to occur normally?
[12:04:27] <tj_vantoll> I don't believe that you can.  You can always trigger custom one.
[12:15:34] <rxaviers> And I dont wanna fire the change on every keyup. Still looking for a cleaner way then needing to re-implement change
[12:21:14] <rxaviers> http://jsfiddle.net/63JeZ/
[12:24:17] <tj_vantoll> Any reason you can't just run the keyup logic onchange?
[12:27:02] <rxaviers> It's being used on themeroller to validade invalid inputs. I think it has been used keyup to emphasize the error to the user, since he can't input it. On change may be passed by him. That's my guess. But, good question.
[12:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll is correct, there's no way to get a native change event if you programatically set a value.
[12:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> I would suggest not changing the value in keyup.
[12:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's very obtrusive.
[12:30:01] <tj_vantoll> In general I don't really like changing the value on key presses.
[12:30:12] <rxaviers> I agree
[12:30:14] <tj_vantoll> For example select all is broke in your fiddle.
[12:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[12:30:38] <rxaviers> I will change that validation to onchange
[12:30:46] <rxaviers> thks for the help ;
[12:30:47] <rxaviers> ;)
[12:30:52] <tj_vantoll> Using keyup to show a validation error of some sort is cool though.
[12:31:06] <tj_vantoll> Just kind of depends.
[12:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, you probably don't want to get into good UX for validation :-P
[12:31:21] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, I guess you are on chrome then ;)
[12:31:42] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez No, no I don't :)
[12:31:45] <tj_vantoll> And yes Chrome.
[12:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: For cross-browser annoyance, try typing a value, then moving your cursor to the middle of the text and pressing space.
[12:33:47] <rxaviers> yeap veryy annoying
[12:34:06] <rxaviers> will get rid of those things in themeRoller and DB now
