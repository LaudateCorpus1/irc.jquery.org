[12:56:40] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yt?
[13:17:29] <jzaefferer> hey kris, how's it going?
[13:19:54] <kborchers> good, i think i figured out my issue. working on the nav menu and triggering click wasn't following the links but i got that working now, though i'm using window.open :/
[13:21:39] <kborchers> can you think of a better way to follow links in menu using keyboard?
[13:29:07] <kborchers> jzaefferer: any thoughts before i move forward? also noticed a weird issue where if i click a link that opens in new window, then go back to menu and use keyboard to "click" again, it opens two new windows but only runs my code once. fun!
[13:29:35] <kborchers> that wierd issue might lead me to a better way to "click" links with the keyboard ;)
[14:23:49] <kborchers> jzaefferer: nvm, i have something working so i'll just finish building out the demo and then have you take a look. have a good weekend!
