[03:30:15] <jzaefferer> gnarf around?
[06:09:10] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sup
[06:09:41] <jzaefferer> I messed around with commit hooks this morning
[06:09:52] <jzaefferer> this is a good overview: http://fourkitchens.com/blog/2011/09/20/trigger-jenkins-builds-pushing-github
[06:10:22] <jzaefferer> I installed that plugin, created a github user and gave it the right permissions, added the url to the QUnit project as a post-receive hook - and then nothing happens
[06:10:49] <gnarf> hrm
[06:10:55] <jzaefferer> I tried curling the hook url, which, without any arguments throws an exception about null json something, which makes sense as github is supposed to send json
[06:11:42] <jzaefferer> I tried to check jenkins logs, but whatever I do with /var/log/jenkins gives me Permission Denied
[06:12:01] <gnarf> sudo less /var/log/jenkins ?
[06:12:41] <jzaefferer> [jqadmin@swarm-01 log]$ sudo less /var/log/jenkins
[06:12:41] <jzaefferer> /var/log/jenkins is a directory
[06:12:41] <jzaefferer> [jqadmin@swarm-01 log]$ sudo cd /var/log/jenkins
[06:12:41] <jzaefferer> sudo: cd: command not found
[06:12:58] <gnarf> sudo bash
[06:13:02] <gnarf> cd /var/log/jenkis
[06:13:19] <jzaefferer> thanks
[06:13:30] <gnarf> np
[06:13:33] <gnarf> sudo bash is useful
[06:13:35] <gnarf> when you want a root shell
[06:14:18] <jzaefferer> okay, that gets us somewhere...
[06:14:20] <jzaefferer> Oct 10, 2011 1:13:54 PM hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter doFilter
[06:14:20] <jzaefferer> WARNING: No valid crumb was included in request for /github-webhook/.  Returning 403.
[06:14:36] <jzaefferer> whatever that means
[06:14:41] <gnarf> heh
[06:14:48] <jzaefferer> maybe the #jenkins folks can help me with that
[06:14:53] <jzaefferer> so far they ignored me /o\
[06:15:03] <gnarf> ?glwt
[06:15:03] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[06:16:22] <jzaefferer> https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-10263?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=150337#comment-150337
[06:16:38] <jzaefferer> I guess I'll disable csrf then...
[06:17:49] <gnarf> ummm
[06:18:02] <gnarf> the fact that you CAN disable that is kinda scary... :)
[06:20:57] <gnarf> looks like that did somethig jzaefferer
[06:23:50] <jzaefferer> mhm, true, it still checks if there actually are changes: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/GitHubPollLog/?
[06:24:04] <jzaefferer> so it only builds when there's new stuff, which is fine
[06:24:11] <jzaefferer> and will break again if the repo is "corrupt"
[06:28:05] <jzaefferer> gnarf: the changes page now links back to github for each commit: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/changes
[06:28:49] <gnarf> we are still having the problem of browser headers
[06:29:10] <gnarf> also, is there a status other than pass/fail we can use for incomplete swarms?
[06:47:25] <ThiefMaster|work> hi, is the following issue with draggable in IE already known? http://jsfiddle.net/EHHJx/
[06:47:37] <ThiefMaster|work> (ignore the line 192 error; it's something broken in jsfiddle itself and unrelated to the problem)
[06:47:58] <ThiefMaster|work> basically draggable breaks as soon as the contents of the draggable element are replaced with something else onmousedown
[06:48:34] <kborchers> which IE, seems ok in 9
[06:48:37] <gnarf> jzaefferer: omg that email ;)
[06:48:37] <ThiefMaster|work> 8
[06:48:55] <kborchers> hold on, have to fire up a vm for that one
[06:50:44] <ThiefMaster|work> might also break in ie8 mode of ie9
[06:50:46] <gnarf> kborchers: just liked that fiddle because it has .box ;)
[06:51:15] <kborchers> i can't resist .box
[07:00:17] <kborchers> ThiefMaster|work: I do see the issue you are referring to and I do not see a ticket similar to that issue. Please file the bug at http://bugs.jqueryui.com. Thanks
[07:03:04] <ThiefMaster|work> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7778
[07:24:25] <jzaefferer> gnarf: haven't yet looked into the headers stuff, there might be an open pull request for that
[07:24:49] <jzaefferer> as for incomplete, I'm ignoring that until we get the browserstack guys on board
[07:24:57] <jzaefferer> or they say that they aren't on board...
[07:25:13] <gnarf> right
[07:25:30] <gnarf> was just a random thought that it might be better to only report failing for a failed test
[07:25:51] <gnarf> just "Incomplete" for tests that didn't finish
[07:34:32] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #95: STILL FAILING in 1 min 20 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/95/
[07:34:33] <jq-jenkins> * kris.borchers: Popup: Added tooltip style demo and link to demos index
[07:34:33] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Tooltip demo: Use position option in tracking demo.
[07:36:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf: makes sense, and Jenkins even supports three states for build results, but getting TestSwarm to support that is a bit too involved
[07:49:34] <jzaefferer> hey wwalser, finally merged your pull request, as well as all others
[07:55:02] <gnarf> jzaefferer: because it requires writing java code?
[07:55:27] <jzaefferer> gnarf: pretty much
[07:55:31] <gnarf> or like swarm can't build that report?
[07:55:57] <jzaefferer> swarm reports notstarted, so that's fine
[07:56:15] <gnarf> cuz if we could have a "jobstatus" url to spit out json
[07:56:22] <gnarf> does that make it any easier in java?
[07:56:54] <jzaefferer> maybe
[07:56:56] <jzaefferer> see https://github.com/appendto/jenkins-testswarm/blob/master/src/main/java/com/appendto/hudson/testswarm/TestSwarmDecisionMaker.java
[07:57:40] <gnarf> that just returns true false
[07:58:11] <gnarf> https://github.com/appendto/jenkins-testswarm/blob/master/src/main/java/com/appendto/hudson/testswarm/TestSwarmIntegrationBuilder.java#L196
[07:58:17] <gnarf> i assume we can do an incomplete there
[08:00:00] <gnarf> hr
[08:00:10] <gnarf> seems that it never actually sets a "ok" result
[09:48:30] <jzaefferer> gnarf: probably "ok" is the default, you only change it on failure
[09:51:13] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, any news from browserstack? any replies that need to get drafted?
[09:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> they're aiming for the end of the month to have clients available for us
[09:56:19] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[09:56:31] <jzaefferer> Jenkins is now working reasonably well
[09:56:47] <jzaefferer> we've got jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Color, jQuery Mobile and QUnit hooked up via commit hooks
[09:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:57:13] <jzaefferer> the commit bot is in three channels, though currently not posting anything for mobile
[09:57:21] <jzaefferer> thats just a checkbox
[09:57:30] <jzaefferer> will be more useful once we actually have the clients connected
[09:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> can we change the naming from "jQuery UI commit #647bab506e288658c8a28dab1083c657ad61951e" to "647bab5"?
[09:57:53] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah, need to figure out how to get at the short hash
[09:58:35] <jzaefferer> https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin#GitPlugin-AdvancedFeatures
[09:58:56] <jzaefferer> just GIT_COMMIT (in use) and GIT_BRANCH, no GIT_SHORTCOMMIT or something...
[09:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....the test result snapshots are pointing at a bad stylesheet
[09:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=2108&client_id=153
[09:59:14] <gnarf> or to do a substr on it
[09:59:59] <gnarf> hrm
[10:00:02] <gnarf> that should be there
[10:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/491
[10:00:04] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by chrisleishman (3h, 34m ago): Add renderMenu option to autocomplete
[10:01:21] <jzaefferer> gnarf: maybe its gone as TestSwarm stores just the html, and we delete old revisions, including css files?
[10:01:29] <gnarf> pretty much
[10:01:36] <gnarf> thats my assumption
[10:01:43] <jzaefferer> newer ones work fine: http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=2140&client_id=209
[10:02:00] <gnarf> we could make a rewrite for that
[10:02:34] <gnarf>  /git/jquery-ui/.*/external/qunit.css -> /git/jquery-ui/master/external/qunit.css
[10:02:55] <jzaefferer> that's probably fine
[10:03:43] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, I moved the menu issue from the selectmenu to the menu page: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu
[10:04:17] <kborchers> jzaefferer: cool. i was planning on looking at that and continuing on popup tonight
[10:04:49] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: goodness! i saw you close that pull this morning and thought nothing else of it.
[10:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> if he wants a render option so badly he should just write an extension
[10:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand why he's so against this
[10:06:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: point him at your extensions?
[10:07:04] <gnarf> i use the html extension
[10:07:07] <gnarf> its awesome
[10:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:16:25] <kborchers> jzaefferer: do we want popup to not allow the user to tab out of it? Only way to exit popup with keyboard is escape
[10:18:16] <jzaefferer> yeah, pretty much - in that case it behaves like a dialog
[10:18:23] <gnarf> hey jzaefferer http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/lastFailedBuild/console
[10:18:32] <gnarf> how did we fix this?
[10:18:42] <jzaefferer> chown to jenkins
[10:19:09] <jzaefferer> basically anything in htdocs/git should be owned by jenkins
[10:20:07] <gnarf> hrm
[10:20:10] <gnarf> something sems wrong here
[10:20:21] <gnarf> the swarm injection seems to be injecting itself
[10:20:29] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/0m3B3b3N3B1U1O0Y0z0R
[10:21:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, so then what purpose does the focusout handler serve that isn't covered by the "click outside" handler?
[10:21:34] <kborchers> the reason i ask is that the focusout is being triggered by an event bubbling from a focused element inside the popup when you click inside causing it to close
[10:21:44] <kborchers> thus the issue with selecting text inside, etc.
[10:21:54] <jzaefferer> gnarf: INCEPTION
[10:22:10] <jzaefferer> kborchers: no idea
[10:22:19] <jzaefferer> sure, I may have written that at some point...
[10:23:05] <kborchers> so probably safe to remove the focusout handler then
[10:23:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: fixed http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=2108&client_id=153 jzaefferer
[10:23:45] <gnarf> RewriteRule ^jquery-ui/[^/]+/external/qunit.css$ jquery-ui/master/external/qunit.css
[10:23:56] <gnarf> done after the check for the real file
[10:24:06] <gnarf> so while its testing it should serve up the actual branch
[10:24:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: have you seen that swarm recursion before / know where i should start looking?
[10:31:19] <gnarf> aha, found it
[10:33:15] <gnarf> hrm
[10:33:17] <gnarf> okay
[10:33:29] <gnarf> now it seems that my test suite isn't reporting back
[10:33:32] <gnarf> its running
[10:33:35] <gnarf> but yellow
[10:33:39] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/232/
[10:34:53] <jzaefferer> did you add the swarminject stuff in jquery-color itself?
[10:34:58] <gnarf> nope
[10:35:04] <jzaefferer> k, then that's missing
[10:35:53] <gnarf> its that chunk of code from testrunner.js ?
[10:36:14] <jzaefferer> see https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/3006fa77db4625c4293c368a8999ddb1abba7f48

[10:39:19] <gnarf> awesome
[10:39:21] <gnarf> thanks
[10:39:25] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/
[10:47:19] <jzaefferer> nice
[10:47:26] <jzaefferer> now just need to get back those browser icons...

[11:03:00] <jzaefferer> ajpiano danheberden: did you consider using octopress as the static site generator for learning and other pages with git-based deployments?
[11:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> holy crap, 59 seconds is a bit low
[11:03:37] <danheberden> i was relying on ajpiano's judgement so hadn't looked at any others
[11:04:14] <scott_gonzalez> that'd be like 100 clients connected
[11:04:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: a test timed out, killing the entire job
[11:05:09] <jzaefferer> jenkins ignores everything else once that happens
[11:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[11:05:33] <jzaefferer> stops polling on timeout or failure
[11:05:43] <jzaefferer> makes sense in a more ideal world :-)
[11:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> maybe I'll dig into autocomplete next
[11:06:26] <jzaefferer> danheberden: okay, makes sense - apparently nanoc and jekyll and octopress aren't that different anyway
[11:06:35] <danheberden> yeah, they all seem pretty similar
[11:06:40] <danheberden> we need a node one to be cool kids
[11:06:48] <jzaefferer> friend of mine is working a lot on octropress these days, that's why I asked
[11:06:52] <jzaefferer> true dat!
[11:07:09] <jzaefferer> I wanted to try it, ended up compiling Ruby 1.9.2
[11:07:15] <jzaefferer> wtf
[11:07:30] <jzaefferer> what's wrong with these people? whats wrong with binaries?
[11:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> rvm
[11:08:01] <jzaefferer> yeah, rvm is what is compiling Ruby...

[11:43:29] <gnarf> i don't know if this ever worked on tags
[11:46:47] <kborchers> wow, that's a huge problem gnarf! i can't believe those UI guys make the source visible when you view source!

[12:44:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: crap
[12:44:48] <jzaefferer> btw. how did you get autocomplete to work?
[12:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> MAGIC
[12:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> I connect my client to TestSwarm and ran the test twice
[12:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> I still have no idea what the problem is
[12:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> but it only dies on the first run
[12:45:53] <jzaefferer> ah, also crap
[12:46:02] <jzaefferer> btw. here's the IE8 killing line: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/run.js#L121
[12:46:23] <jzaefferer> Member not found  - means e is undefined?
[12:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, no idea why that line is causing a problem
[12:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> maybe?
[12:46:51] <jzaefferer> data undefined wouldn't cause an error, retrySend undefined doesn't make sense at all
[12:47:27] <jzaefferer> this is where handleMessage is used: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/run.js#L12
[12:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...should it be using || window.event ?
[12:47:58] <jzaefferer> is that the old `var e = e || window.event` crap?
[12:48:07] <jzaefferer> without the var actually
[12:48:16] <jzaefferer> I guess we can test that :/
[12:48:37] <jzaefferer> e = e || window.event;
[12:50:37] <jzaefferer> deployed
[12:51:01] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: keep an eye on your IE :-)
[12:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok :-)
[12:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> this doesn't look right: http://gyazo.com/4e8c99bf452031b9e5a9619028b951f7
[12:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[12:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> it has the main swarm page open in the iframe
[12:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> seems to be working properly now that I refreshed

[12:56:27] <gnarf> its working now tho
[12:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[12:57:14] <jzaefferer> I can clean out all jobs once to get rid of those

[13:02:09] <jzaefferer> yeah, that's it
[13:04:00] <jzaefferer> sweet: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/
[13:04:08] <jzaefferer> also gnarf: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/
[13:06:30] <jzaefferer> holy crap, original issue is from Sepetember 2009: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/13
[13:06:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #13 on testswarm, reported by Xorath (2y, 3w ago): Job status and tinder should not assume first row is equal to others
[13:10:06] <gnarf> heh
[13:10:09] <gnarf> qunit fails on ie6
[13:10:10] <gnarf> :)
[13:11:15] <gnarf> so guys
[13:11:25] <gnarf> im still curious what to do about those failing units in effects
[13:11:43] <gnarf> i think i'm just going to comment them out as a "it would be nice to find a fix for this"
[13:14:34] <jzaefferer> you mean those FF failures?
[13:15:40] <gnarf> yeah
[13:16:47] <gnarf> there is code in there trying to support that right now
[13:16:49] <gnarf> and well
[13:16:53] <gnarf> it just doesn't work
[13:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://gyazo.com/7391758a1f25261ae9c66d59b84dcad0
[13:22:53] <jzaefferer> bah, yeah
[13:22:57] <jzaefferer> I'll clear out old jobs
[13:22:59] <jzaefferer> that is, all jobs
[13:23:18] <jzaefferer> those are from the time where we were moving things around...
[13:28:00] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #98: STILL FAILING in 1 min 8 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/98/
[13:30:55] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: would you be fine with pulling this into an editable branch and giving rxaviers access to work on it? similar to fnagel working on selectmenu within our repo - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/456/files#diff-0
[13:30:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by rxaviers (3w, 5d ago): Editable: new widget created (actually, revived from previous inlineedit)
[13:31:14] <jzaefferer> that way view… works as usual and people can send PRs against jquery-ui instead of a fork
[13:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> sure, if you're going to manage it :-P
[13:38:32] <jzaefferer> its not worse then trying to write it myself besides all the other grid stuff
[13:42:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer created editable (+11 new commits): http://git.io/2r-F3A
[13:42:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Inlineedit: reviving this widget. jQuery UI has no such functionality available. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[13:42:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Inlineedit: parameterizing class-strings, jsfying html, and organizing methods. Hardcoded strings all over the code was confusing and methods could simply be made more clear. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[13:42:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Editable: renamed Inlineedit to Editable. The latter is simpler than the former and has been preferred by the core team. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[13:44:26] <jzaefferer> okay, pushed the editable branch and gave rxaviers write access
[13:44:32] <jzaefferer> same deal as for selectmenu
[13:44:53] * rxaviers :)
[13:46:32] <jzaefferer> not sure yet how to deal with widgets that aren't on master
[13:47:14] <jzaefferer> integration branches aren't that much fun, merging mask into editable means we can't merge editable into master until mask is ready
[13:48:59] <jzaefferer> I guess the best strategy is: get em done!
[13:49:10] <jzaefferer> maintaining lots of branches over a long time is a bad idea anyway
[13:56:31] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: I did some more testing, added TODOs on the wiki: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137959/Editable
[13:58:44] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, excelent! I will work on those time permitting. I assume there's no urgency, but if it is just let me know and I try to give it some higher priority.
[13:58:58] <jzaefferer> well, asap of course :-)
[13:59:21] <jzaefferer> the earlier we get it in master, the earlier we can integrate it with other branches, like mask and selectmenu
[14:00:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, alright ;)
[14:01:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers, could you also review the eidtable that Ca-Phun mentioned in the comments? check out the controls option and how the live() support is implemented
[14:02:06] <jzaefferer> *edtiable
[14:02:07] <jzaefferer> darn
[14:02:55] <jzaefferer> other then that - have you worked with QUnit?
[14:03:19] <jzaefferer> if not, take a look at the autocomplete and spinner unit tests
[14:03:23] <jzaefferer> those are probably good references
[14:03:51] <jzaefferer> once we notice issues that aren't apparent by looking at the demos, we should start with the unit tests
[14:06:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I havent found anything new on Ca-Phun version of editable. But, I may have overlooked it. I will check it again with emphasis on that method and options.
[14:06:24] <gnarf> jzaefferer: what stops us from pulling timepicker/mask into master?
[14:06:25] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, nope, will learn it.
[14:06:44] <gnarf> demos
[14:06:45] <gnarf> docs?
[14:06:57] <jzaefferer> gnarf: not docs, those are missing for tooltip etc as well
[14:07:14] <gnarf> so we need some demos?
[14:07:26] <gnarf> i can write them if someone has some contrived ideas for demos to write
[14:07:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rworth: could we do a gang review of mask branch sometime this week?
[14:07:59] <gnarf> we can skype it
[14:08:08] <jzaefferer> nitpickers gonna nitpick :-)
[14:08:09] <rworth> I'm available Tue or Thu
[14:09:03] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez?
[14:09:14] <gnarf> i'm free
[14:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I should be available
[14:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> the client I'm working with is being unresponsive, so as of right now I've got plenty of time :-P
[14:10:19] <gnarf> nice
[14:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> does tomorrow work for everyone?
[14:12:08] <jzaefferer> yeah, preferably sometime EST morning
[14:12:23] <jzaefferer> like, before 11am
[14:12:59] <jzaefferer> gonna head out for out JS meetup about then, meet with the octopress commiter about static site generators and later talk about testing team...
[14:13:06] <jzaefferer> maybe I can get some more recruits :-)
[14:14:55] <gnarf> i can prolly pull off 10am
[14:15:10] <gnarf> much earlier and i debate staying up
[14:15:11] <gnarf> :)
[14:15:17] <gnarf> (EST)
[14:16:04] <gnarf> I'm trying to fill in the browser holes in swarm
[14:16:24] <gnarf> kborchers: ie6 position fails?
[14:16:38] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=19&client_id=12
[14:17:06] <jzaefferer> gnarf: its a hit-the-mole-game - you'll never win :p
[14:17:18] <kborchers> exactly ... could not track it down
[14:17:37] <gnarf> is it always 42?
[14:17:41] <gnarf> :)
[14:17:49] <jzaefferer> it must be
[14:18:01] <gnarf> is that the padding/margin or something?
[14:19:22] <kborchers> if you look further down though, they're off by more and it just seems really weird. much more than just a couple of pixels that could be explained by some padding or a margin.
[14:19:49] <kborchers> it's always left too, never top
[14:23:09] <gnarf> whitespace?
[14:23:11] <gnarf> :)
[14:24:42] <kborchers> hmm
[14:31:41] <kborchers> nope ... i removed all whitespace and re-ran with same results
[14:32:12] <kborchers> gotta head out ... i'll be working on menu, popup and i'll take another look at this issue to later tonight
[22:07:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] kborchers pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ME0HSw
[22:07:38] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Popup: Removed the focusout and focusin handlers which are nolonger necessary. Also updated the tooltip style demo to have a little more interactive content. - kborchers
[22:08:59] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #99: STILL FAILING in 1 min 13 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/99/
[22:08:59] <jq-jenkins> kris.borchers: Popup: Removed the focusout and focusin handlers which are nolonger necessary. Also updated the tooltip style demo to have a little more interactive content.
[22:09:00] <bot-t> (1 hour 45 mins ago) <DaveMethvin> tell jq-jenkins yeah I KNOW
[22:11:43] <kborchers> wat?
[22:12:01] <kborchers> must be because there are no units yet for popup
