[09:32:20] <b-ot> jzaefferer: @Aintaer: Man @jqueryui you guys sure know how toOH GOD WHAT IS THIS DATEPICKER
[09:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I saw that last night.
[09:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to respond, but I didn't even know what to say.
[09:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> "Sorry about that" :-P
[09:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I can't get a big screenshot of the downloads graph :-(
[09:33:49] <jzaefferer> This is.. interesting: https://github.com/vladikoff/grunt-devtools
[09:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, I have an idea.
[09:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can make my browser larger than my monitor...
[09:34:31] <scott_gonzalez> brilliant
[09:34:52] <jzaefferer> uhokay
[09:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how to make graphs larger in Splunk
[09:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> The ones on the dashboard are always 50% width.
[09:38:35] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: http://bassistance.de/i/61c0c1.png ?
[09:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> Got that one already.
[09:42:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:42:51] <jzaefferer> doesn't even need mouseover, since it doesn't hide on mouseout :-)
[11:53:54] <dam1r89> hello
[13:18:39] <lypse> does anyone tried to set custom position for each nested submenu in menu() plugin?
[13:21:36] <djQuery> lypse, you would want to bind to the create event
[13:22:21] <djQuery> lypse, and ask support Q's in #jquery  http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#event-create
[13:39:39] <lypse> okay, thanks
[14:20:28] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Have a great time in Toronto! BTW you need to update your page :-)
