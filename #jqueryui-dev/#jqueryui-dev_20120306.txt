[07:27:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any idea if/when Dave Stein will be back?
[07:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I think he's "back" but haven't seen anything from him.
[07:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> I think he was moving.
[07:48:33] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:09:41] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: in the meantime, any thoughts on that map demo? Does it fit?
[09:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which demo? Did you send a PR or something?

[09:19:14] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grunt] Build/grunt: Switch to adm-zip. Use addFile method until addLocalFile is implemented. - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:29:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: this one: http://view.jqueryui.com/interactions/demos/draggable/map.html
[09:30:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think something like that is good.
[09:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like the distance you can drag is pretty limited in that example, but the concept is good.
[09:31:39] <jzaefferer> yeah, its more interesting on a small screen
[09:31:59] <jzaefferer> I'd use a bigger map, but apparently the statics map API doesn't go beyond 640x640
[09:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> So just make the wrapper div smaller.
