[13:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure this is super old.
[13:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...it's actually a lot of rules.
[13:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> Every state.
[13:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, not even *every* state.
[13:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> Just highlight and error.
[13:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why we'd force anchors to have the same color as the text though.
