[13:18:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, I was looking at http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0-rc.1/demos/panel-responsive/ 
[13:20:23] <agcolom> I think there might be something wrong there... There are a few items in the left panel that just say "New". I am not sure what you planned on having there, but I have the feeling the New might be a span you wanted to add to other list items, because the html has a </span> (but no matching opening <span>)
[13:20:46] <agcolom> So something is not quite right, but I'm not sure what it is supposed to be :-)
[13:27:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[13:27:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you are right
[13:27:24] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[13:27:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no idea where those "new" items are coming from
[13:27:53] <agcolom> oh ;-) that's weird ;-)
[13:28:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think we just copy paste a list from somewhere
[13:28:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: all items link to the same landing page
[13:28:32] <agcolom> yes
[13:29:13] <uGoMobi> so the text of the item doesn't really matter
[13:29:16] <agcolom> also, are the panels supposed to stay open if the screen is wide enough? 
[13:29:20] <uGoMobi> but "new" is weird
[13:29:40] <uGoMobi> stay open when you do what?
[13:30:28] <agcolom> I thought that was what was meant by responsive panel
[13:30:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah, you mean when you click on the page
[13:31:19] <agcolom> "To make this responsive, you can make the page re-flow at wider widths. This allows both the panel menu and page to be used together when more space is available."
[13:31:19] <uGoMobi> yeah, that is correct
[13:31:29] <uGoMobi> we do that with push panels only
[13:31:35] <agcolom> I can't make it work on my screen
[13:31:44] <uGoMobi> it works for me
[13:32:16] <agcolom> so what is supposed to happen?
[13:32:48] <agcolom> when I make the screen wider, the page content "reflows" leaving large margins to the right and left
[13:32:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when the panel is open it won't close when you click on the page content
[13:33:23] <agcolom> oh, ok! 
[13:33:36] <agcolom> Only works on the left panel
[13:33:44] <uGoMobi> yeah, the reflow is the responsive part
[13:33:57] <uGoMobi> yes, left is push panel, right panel is reveal
[13:34:05] <agcolom> ok. 
[13:34:22] <agcolom> I thought reponsive panel was like what we have in the demos
[13:34:25] <uGoMobi> both reflow, but only with push we disable the dismiss layer
[13:34:35] <agcolom> so the menu is there if the screen is wide
[13:34:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that's even more responsive :)
[13:34:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but I did that with custom CSS for the demos nav menu
[13:35:13] <agcolom> so there are several levels of responsiveness ;-)
[13:35:41] <agcolom> Yes, I really like that one and find it v useful!
[13:35:43] <uGoMobi> yeah, something like that  :)
[13:36:20] <uGoMobi> so the demo works corectly, we just have to remove those "new" items
[13:36:27] <agcolom> yes
[13:37:54] <agcolom> the same list seems to be used here: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0-rc.1/demos/panel-fixed/
[13:38:31] <uGoMobi> they used to be one demo
[13:38:36] <uGoMobi> I split them in two
[13:39:11] <uGoMobi> for the fixed panel demo it is important that we use a long list
[13:39:30] <agcolom> yes, but we need to remove the "new" there as well :-)
[13:39:34] <uGoMobi> so maybe we shouldn't just delete "new" but replac
[13:39:49] <uGoMobi> replace by something else
[13:40:27] <agcolom> yes, that works also 
[13:41:19] <agcolom> also, Within the "page" container, any valid HTML markup can be used, but for typical pages in jQuery Mobile, the immediate children of a "page" are divs with data-roles of "header", "content", and "footer". should be changed...
[13:41:38] <agcolom> I'm not sure what we should use though instead
[13:42:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I changed that somewhere
[13:42:34] <agcolom> data-role="content" is still used also on that page... (not in the 1st example but in the other ones)
[13:42:42] <agcolom> yes I thought so too...
[13:42:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/pages/
[13:43:17] <agcolom> oh yes of course, I'm looking at rc1!!!!
[13:43:51] <agcolom> oh, no, the examples still use data-role="content"
[13:44:52] <agcolom> Are you making the change or do you want me to do a quick one using the github editor?
[13:45:04] <uGoMobi> I thought _|Nix|_ replaced them all
[13:45:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: would be great if you can fix them
[13:45:26] <agcolom> I think he did in the api docs...
[13:45:35] <agcolom> sure ok, I'll do that
[13:45:52] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[13:50:19] <agcolom> there are only 6 :-)

[14:04:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi: here we have a content div that already have a class...
[14:05:02] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/edit/master/demos/toolbar-external/index2.php
[14:05:28] <agcolom> so do I just add the content class to that one? and also, in which order should they go?
[14:05:47] <agcolom> currently it is <div data-role="content" class="jqm-content"> 
[14:06:19] <agcolom> so would that become <div role="main" class="content jqm-content"> ?
[14:07:08] <agcolom> sorry I mean ui-content ^
[14:07:29] <agcolom>  I'm guessing the answer is yes, by looking at another page...

[14:12:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: is it normal that on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/demos/toolbar-fixed/webapp.php all the content divs have the same id?
[14:14:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: well it isn't valid markup
[14:14:28] <agcolom> exactly
[14:14:39] <uGoMobi> so it's not really a good example
[14:14:55] <agcolom> content1 for page 1 content 2 for page 2? 
[14:15:50] <agcolom> is the id even used? 
[14:16:03] <agcolom> maybe we can just remove them?
[14:17:07] <uGoMobi>   <style>
[14:17:07] <uGoMobi>     #edit-with-js-bin { display: none !important; }
[14:17:07] <uGoMobi>   </style>
[14:17:20] <uGoMobi> that has been copied from a JS Bin template ^^^
[14:17:30] <uGoMobi> and should be removed for sure
[14:17:32] <agcolom> oh
[14:18:07] <uGoMobi> yeah id="content" can be removed
[14:18:15] <agcolom> and data-theme="g"
[14:19:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there are a lot of things wrong in there
[14:19:27] <agcolom> yes, it looks like a bug reported
[14:19:36] <uGoMobi> I also see a link to jQuery core 2.0

[14:19:52] <agcolom> I remember seeing this bug report, because I tested it on my phone!
[14:20:12] <uGoMobi> and the markup needs to be cleaned up
[14:20:24] <uGoMobi> ahh
[14:20:39] <uGoMobi> I think arschmitz added this demo
[14:20:59] <uGoMobi> let's ask him if he can clean it up
[14:21:04] <agcolom> sure
[14:21:50] <agcolom> Also sorry for using the editor and not my local setup, but I haven't done anything on this repo for such a long time that I'm scared to break things ;-)
[14:22:19] <agcolom> I'll try to catch scott_gonzalez to make sure I'm doing things right sometime next week..
[14:22:48] <agcolom> do you use git in the command line?
[14:22:51] <uGoMobi> ok :)
[14:22:56] <uGoMobi> yes i do
[14:23:06] <agcolom> ha, maybe you cna help me then!
[14:23:21] <agcolom> In the api docs, I do a git pull --reabse
[14:23:24] <agcolom> rebase
[14:23:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: did you see scott_gonzalez his answer about cherry-picking commits from API docs 1-4 branch into master?
[14:23:42] <agcolom> but here I was told to do git fetch origin master
[14:23:49] <agcolom> no
[14:24:14] <uGoMobi> well we can just cherry-pick the commits that don't belong in 1-4 branch
[14:24:23] <uGoMobi> just make sure you don't use -x flag
[14:24:38] <uGoMobi> the ones you put in your Google doc
[14:24:44] <agcolom> ok
[14:24:54] <agcolom> I can cherry-pick them into master?
[14:24:58] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:25:08] <agcolom> but some depend on many others 
[14:25:33] <agcolom> so person x added some text, and I fixed some formatting in that text
[14:25:41] <uGoMobi> I see
[14:26:01] <uGoMobi> if the text that you fixed is only in 1-4 than we can't cherry-pick
[14:26:01] <agcolom> except the xhtml -> html 
[14:26:27] <uGoMobi> we should first look into the commit that changed the text that you fixed
[14:26:44] <agcolom> yes
[14:27:06] <uGoMobi> I always use $ git fetch origin
[14:27:20] <agcolom> and how do you rebase?
[14:27:26] <uGoMobi> but I am not git expert so I am afraid to give you advise
[14:27:33] <agcolom> np :-)
[14:27:48] <agcolom> I'll ask on monday :-)
[14:27:53] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:28:34] <agcolom> will you ask arschmitz about that funny page?
[14:28:44] <agcolom> or should we open an issue?
[14:29:00] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's better
