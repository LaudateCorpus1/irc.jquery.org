[06:14:15] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: thanks done. When you get notifications of every comment anyway it can be easy to miss an issue ping some times.
[06:14:47] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: :)  I can't imagine... especially with such a small team
[06:18:34] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you may want to check out https://jquery.org/team/ and just quickly skim over the former mobile team members
[06:19:12] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: there probably is not much point in pinging any of them on issues if its an issue where you would ping them probably just ping either gabriel_schulhof or I
[06:19:31] <arschmitz> or both and we can fight to see who answers first lol
[06:21:10] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: not a single woman on your current team?!?  *tsk* We're going to have to work on that ;)
[06:21:28] <lisa_deluca> scanning the list.  at least I'm new so they'll forgive me if I don't know they were working on jquery
[06:21:41] <lisa_deluca> I'll try to check though before pinging
[06:26:14] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yes there is
[06:26:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: is shes just a board member so she get a bio pshhh
[06:26:36] <arschmitz> :p
[06:27:30] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: ah, i was looking at "The jQuery Team" section :p
[06:27:41] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: however im sure we could use a couple non board member women team members too

[07:24:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you would have to test and see if it happens on blink based opera
[07:25:09] <arschmitz> i would guess it does not but you never know
[07:25:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[07:25:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do we treat Opera as evergreen?
[07:25:40] <arschmitz> yes
[07:25:47] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Then I'll check.
[07:26:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but 1.4 still supports old opera
[07:26:08] <arschmitz> so this is 1.5+

[07:31:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah. I'm going throught classes support for selectmenu.
[07:36:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh ... hmmm ... I need to find out what is the latest Opera version for Windoze and OSX ... the latest for Linux is 12.16 ...
[07:38:47] <arschmitz> WHA!! are you sure?
[07:39:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: they have never released blink based opera for linux?
[07:39:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh you need to use the beta stream still
[07:39:54] <arschmitz> on linux thats crazy!
[07:40:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. That's what I thought :( Different versions for different OSs :(
[07:41:52] <gabriel_schulhof> Wow! It's 25 ...
[07:42:15] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and great ... only available as a deb package :(
[08:01:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: On Opera beta 25 window.opera is undefined, so that code doesn't even execute anymore.
[08:01:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but now im unsure about touching old opera code since 12 is still current on linux
[08:03:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I see. So we should continue to support old Opera in 1.5?
[08:03:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright. It's not a big change.
[08:03:48] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not sure yet
[08:04:10] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I guess we can yank it whenever.
[08:04:30] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... And opera >= 20 for Linux may drop out of beta by the time we release.

[10:00:08] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: When you said headers could be customized, which headers were you talking about?
[10:00:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Again, thinking Ajax here.
[10:00:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the page header like the toolbar
[10:01:01] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and mobile ajax is already all set
[10:01:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i just cant submit the pr until i find out how we are going to handle the accounts / urls
[10:01:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK. I was just hoping we could avoid having to add that small snippet to the template.
[10:02:03] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: no but im going to put it in the js tab and hide the js tab by default
[10:02:41] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. That's as good as it gets. Still, it should be commented to death so as not to confuse enterprising novices.
[10:03:18] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: honestly the only time it could break anything the person would have to know what it was to begin with
[10:03:36] <arschmitz> i cant see someone checking the header on the server but not knowing what it is
[10:03:54] <arschmitz> but obviously it will be commented
[10:04:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm thinking about questions like "So, do I need to add that to my project as well to make it work?"
[10:04:40] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hence comment
[10:04:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i think you are worrying about a non issue
[10:05:39] <gabriel_schulhof> I know ... I felt the same way when I had to inject a script into the API docs examples to turn off pushState in FF iframes.
[10:05:58] <gabriel_schulhof> The script was visible in the final rendition of the example on the API docs site.
[10:06:16] <gabriel_schulhof> I had to add a comment above the script reference saying "You don't need the script below in an actual project".
[10:20:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and are you aware of anyone EVER making a mistake with this?
