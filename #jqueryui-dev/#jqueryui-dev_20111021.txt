[00:23:19] <bot-t> (6 hours 12 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell gnarf https://gist.github.com/1302853 https://gist.github.com/06c3416d2d4721443c66 public and private gists with `git gist-diff` :-)
[04:30:18] <jzaefferer> gnarf: any idea where that gist-diff command is coming from?
[06:26:42] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/m3OuPQ
[06:26:42] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Widget: Use parentWindow if defaultView doesn't exist. - Scott González
[06:30:16] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #128: STILL FAILING in 3 min 27 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/128/

[06:45:15] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, that `git gist-diff` command you mentioned yesterday - is that part of your pretty-diff thingy?
[06:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:48:39] <jzaefferer> asking for password?
[06:48:55] <jzaefferer> I've added my github token to my git config, seems like you should be able to use that
[10:26:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: that token doesn't seem to work :-/
[10:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> I tried it last night
[10:27:00] <scott_gonzalez> you have to either register the app to get an OAuth2 token or you have to send your password
[10:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand why they don't just accept GitHub token
[10:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> I figured people wouldn't want to store their password in a config file and they wouldn't want to register a git command with GitHub
[10:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> so I figured prompting for the password was the best option
[10:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> you can also just press enter (don't enter a password) and it'll post it anonymously
