[02:12:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Please tell me I didn't break anything major.
[02:12:57] <_|Nix|_>  :)
[02:14:54] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[02:15:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was looking at the hover bg color of the horizontal radio buttons
[02:16:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I noticed that there is an issue with a regex, but you are better with regex than me :)
[02:16:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sure! Point me at it!
[02:17:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you have  .class.ui-btn-a.class or .class.ui-bar-a.class the regex doesn't change the -a to -b
[02:17:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm looking at the PRs from Kangsik and Hyunsook.
[02:17:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 
[02:17:17] <_|Nix|_> I've already applied one from Kangsik.
[02:17:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For the Link accordion.
[02:17:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: If you have .class.ui-btn-a it works
[02:17:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[02:17:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:17:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where's the regex?
[02:18:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I remember seeing it but if you have it close by you can probably find it faster.
[02:18:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, lemme guess: addSwatch ...
[02:18:49] <uGoMobi> line 256
[02:18:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^^
[02:19:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, so it's just for the preview? The CSS is fine?
[02:19:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we help by simply modifying the template to have that class at the end?
[02:20:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the CSS is in the style block in the head
[02:20:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, the preview CSS is not fine
[02:20:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the markup is fine
[02:20:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:21:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but line 256 modifies the markup, not the CSS.
[02:21:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry I thought it was handling both
[02:21:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. The styleBlock is at the end of the document.
[02:22:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I guess I can see the problem for myself if I look at the DOM for the third swatch in the preview, eh?
[02:23:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, 2nd or 3rd swatch (any swatch other than -a)
[02:24:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: inspect the label element and toggle hover state
[02:24:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you'll see  .ui-page-theme-b .ui-btn.ui-btn-active, html .ui-bar-b .ui-btn.ui-btn-active, html .ui-body-b .ui-btn.ui-btn-active, html body .ui-group-theme-b .ui-btn.ui-btn-active, html head + body .ui-btn.ui-btn-a.ui-btn-active, ...
[02:24:58] <uGoMobi> see that .ui-btn.ui-btn-a.ui-btn-active
[02:26:13] <uGoMobi> and another selector for the same rule html body .ui-flipswitch.ui-bar-a.ui-flipswitch-active
[02:26:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I think it's only if there is no space after -a
[02:26:56] <_|Nix|_> OK, but that means that the label has to have a class from a-swatch.
[02:27:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean
[02:27:33] <uGoMobi> ?
[02:28:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, a rule containingin .ui-btn-a cannot apply to the label unless it has class ui-btn-a, right?
[02:28:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but that's the problem
[02:29:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it should be applied and it will, if it had the correct swatch in the class name
[02:30:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the regex changes "-a " to "-[new swatch] "
[02:30:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it should also change "-a." to "-[new swatch]."
[02:31:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the label/button itself has the correct classes
[02:31:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have an idea. I'll copy the HTML for c-swatch by pressing F2 on the swatch div and copying the text and then I'll look at it with a text editor, because I don't see any ui-blahblah-a anywhere in C-swatch :/
[02:31:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[02:31:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So the classes are correct.
[02:32:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the markup including classes is correct
[02:32:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the styleblock isn't
[02:32:27] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[02:32:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[02:33:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But then it can't be line 256, because line 256 modifies the swatch template before appending it to the preview.
[02:33:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah sorry, that was not the correct line
[02:33:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It must be line 211 - 243.
[02:35:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, starting with the "//adding swatch to CSS" comment
[02:35:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll debul lines 211-243 and check the resulting CSS.
[02:35:47] <_|Nix|_> s/debul/debug/
[02:36:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great, thanks
[02:38:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when we have fixed this I will look into why the active color applied to radio button in the last swatch shows up on the first swatch
[02:38:47] <uGoMobi> it's not C --> A, but last swatch --> A
[02:41:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ummm ... fixing the regex also seems to fix that.
[02:41:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *grin*
[02:41:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just added another replace: .replace( /-a\./g, "-" + lower + "." ) and Bam!

[03:06:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes

[03:07:35] <_|Nix|_> ... to one of the commits.
[03:09:09] <uGoMobi> yeah
[03:09:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wow! Hyunsook's PR fixes the problem where going from 1.4.0 to 1.3.2 breaks the icons!
[03:09:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it easy to change the order of the collapsibles?
[03:09:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.

[06:03:27] <tj_vantoll> Since `grunt build` was removed can you build jQuery UI from the jquery-ui repo anymore?
[06:03:54] <tj_vantoll> Basically I'm wondering what we should do with this section because the instructions here no longer work and are confusing people.
[06:03:56] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui#building-jquery-ui
[06:09:58] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: ^
[06:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> Probably just `grunt concat`
[06:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> We can make a build alias that is just concat.
[06:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> You wouldn't get a minified build, but that seems fine.
[06:15:45] <tj_vantoll> In that case maybe we should just update the docs.
[06:16:06] <tj_vantoll> To use concat.
[06:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt build` is probably common enough that we should create the alias.
[06:18:23] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[06:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe documenting `grunt concat` will be better so people don't expect it to be minifying.
[06:19:04] <tj_vantoll> Yeah that's what I was getting at.
[06:19:31] <tj_vantoll> I could go either way.
[06:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's just update the docs to use concat.
[06:20:05] <tj_vantoll> Ok I can do that.
[06:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, concat will generate a header with the pre-version number and the date, so just that task is fine.
[06:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> Go ahead and update it.
[06:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[06:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, did you see the XSLT guy came up with a cleaner solution for the default values.
[06:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hard to see what changed in this diff, but... https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/commit/4ed57ec7a68b5f8d5bcd319734cdadacb1b60d43
[06:22:34] <tj_vantoll> I briefly saw the commit. Pretty awesome, although it's all a bit over my head.
[06:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the important part is that we no longer have to do anything special in the original attribute to make it overridable.
[06:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> So we're back to just default="null" in the include.
[06:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> And we can override any attribute associated with an element that has a name attribute.
[06:23:55] <tj_vantoll> AH. I hadn't seen this commit https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/6ee221bd20c7d9b7c2d14fa42a7585d3e9b7ba5b

[07:38:14] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, lol, yeap and I therefore made it 2 versions only.
[07:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:38:27] <rxaviers> But, don't worry, because internally it supports unlimited versions
[07:38:35] <rxaviers> I made the interface to be 2 versions only
[07:38:36] <rxaviers> :P
[07:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so supporting more wouldn't be too much work?
[07:38:56] <rxaviers> not at all
[07:39:20] <rxaviers> I mean = yeap, supporting more would be easy
[07:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's get that done :-)
[07:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile has >2 on their download builder already.
[07:39:53] <rxaviers> Sure
[07:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> And there might not be too much time between 1.9.3 and 1.11.0.
[07:40:17] <rxaviers> when is it due to? Can I add that as a feature needed for UI+Mobile milestone?
[07:42:06] <rxaviers> Ah! I see you want to have that done for 1.11 then. Np.
[07:43:22] <rxaviers> What versions are we going to make available on 1.11? 1.9.2, 1.10.3, 1.11.0?
[07:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Ah, haven't gotten to the commit where Travis support was added. So I guess Travis is just using some default settings.
[07:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.3, 1.10.4, 1.11.0
[07:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> But none of those exist yet :-P
[07:44:20] <rxaviers> are we releasing those at once?
[07:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> 1.10.4 then 1.9.3 then 1.11.0
[07:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> So you've got until the 1.11 release.
[07:44:46] <rxaviers> cool, ok

[07:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> But the express docs say that 2.x will continue to be supported, so you shouldn't need to make any changes.
[07:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe just get an updated 2.x version?
[07:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> If switching to 3.x is easy, we should do that though. But it doesn't seem like it should be a blocker for node 0.10 support

[08:17:51] <rxaviers> I guess we curl the release.js script from master, then we use it to build the release of whatever version
[08:18:22] <rxaviers> (about the commit, yeap <shame>)
[08:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> We curl the release.js script from the branch we're going to release from, not always from master.
[08:20:57] <rxaviers> hm ok.. So, yeap I guess it's safer to include the commits on the stable branch as well.

[11:57:48] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, I need your input. Current `Globalize.format(date, format)` allows user to pass a preset (defined by format.length === 1) or his custom format.
[11:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> Seems strange, can't you ask for just a single letter custom format?
[11:58:53] <rxaviers> (in that case you need to prepend it with %, as far as I understood the code)
[11:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> Or are the presets limited to non-conflicting single letters.
[11:59:01] <rxaviers> On CLDR, it doesn't seem usual to let users to pass its own format. But, it's common to let him use the presets only.
[11:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmmm...
[11:59:41] <rxaviers> ex ICU http://demo.icu-project.org/icu4jweb/flexTest.jsp
[11:59:45] <rxaviers> eg. ICU http://demo.icu-project.org/icu4jweb/flexTest.jsp
[11:59:55] <rxaviers> eg2. https://github.com/twitter/twitter-cldr-js/#dates-and-times
[12:00:06] <rxaviers> Although, I have gone deep on ICU implementation.
[12:01:00] <rxaviers> My question is: should we only accept presets too, or should we let user to pass his own patterns too? (Technically, we can do it)
[12:01:14] <rxaviers> I guess I will look at ICU (c and java) implementation better first.
[12:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should have two different methods.
[12:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> One for presets and one for custom.
[12:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like on that first page it's always rewriting the format to a preset.
[12:03:09] <rxaviers> Yeap, the CLDR presets are pretty complex. Specification tells application to pick the best pattern if not found an exact match
[12:03:24] <rxaviers> (if it doesn't* find...)
[12:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> So what do you think about having 2 methods?
[12:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think creating custom formats is going to be common.

[12:24:55] <rxaviers> ICU has constructions of this form:
[12:24:59] <rxaviers> myString = DateFormat.getPatternInstance(DateFormat.YEAR_ABBR_MONTH).format(myDate);
[12:25:45] <rxaviers> So, basically it requires users to call another function to get the presets.
[12:26:05] <rxaviers> Well, we don't need to follow their API. So, we can define ours.
[12:26:15] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, having 2 methods helps!
[12:27:11] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what do you think of differentiating preset vs. format somehow based on the structure of the parameter?
[12:28:30] <rxaviers> eg. Globalize.format(date, format) --- if format is a string, consider it a preset. If format is {pattern: "xx"} consider it the pattern itself
[12:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> We'd probably need to either use an object or a boolean, and neither sounds great for something that's usually as simple as format( date, format)
[12:29:02] <rxaviers> ok, how would you call both methods?
[12:29:05] <rxaviers> name*
[12:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> Naming is tough :-(
[12:30:17] <rxaviers> indeed
[12:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> What is a skeleton?
[12:30:34] <rxaviers> It's how CLDR names the "id" of a preset
[12:30:48] <rxaviers> like: {"GyMMM": "MMM y G"}
[12:30:53] <rxaviers> GyMMM is the skeleton
[12:31:01] <rxaviers> skeleton never changes across locales
[12:31:09] <rxaviers> values change
[12:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> And are the presets just the values associated with the skeleton?
[12:32:37] <rxaviers> yeap
[12:32:59] <rxaviers> which is the pattern that should be used to format.
[12:33:01] <scott_gonzalez> Is preset the official term?
[12:33:05] <rxaviers> nope
[12:33:13] <rxaviers> skeleton is an official term
[12:33:20] <rxaviers> also availableFormats :(
[12:33:57] <rxaviers> www.unicode.org/reports/tr35 /tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table
[12:34:21] <rxaviers> "The availableFormats element and its subelements provide a more flexible formatting mechanism than the predefined list of patterns..."
[12:34:44] <rxaviers> the predefined list of patterns are "full | long | medium | short"
[12:35:34] <rxaviers> I was wondering if we could make it like this:
[12:35:41] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, "full")
[12:35:51] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, "GyMMM")
[12:36:03] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, {pattern: "MMM y G"})
[12:36:12] <rxaviers> (but I didnt like the name "pattern" to be honest)
[12:36:26] <rxaviers> (it's confusing)
[12:36:40] <rxaviers> (the difference is confusing)
[12:37:29] <rxaviers> Or it would be nice if we had a initial character that tells our lib not to expand the preset, like
[12:37:37] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, "=MMM y G")
[12:37:44] <rxaviers> but this is not specified
[12:38:03] <rxaviers> an* initial
[12:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> What if we require 2 calls for the presets?
[12:42:48] <rxaviers> Based on some app examples (including our datepicker), I guess using a preset is a more common usage than specifying the format itself.
[12:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> Globalize.format( date, Globalize.resolveSkeleton( pattern ) )
[12:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> resolveSkeleton isn't a great name.
[12:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> But it's probably easier to come up with a name for that than to figure out a good API to handle both formats.
[12:43:28] <rxaviers> I agree
[12:46:12] <rxaviers> Is there any real usage of having the user to input pattern instead of a preset?
[12:53:22] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, should we also have a Globalize.getDatePattern( "full" ) vs. Globalize.getTimePattern( "full" ) vs. Globalize.getDatetimePattern( "full" )?

[12:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[12:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> For inputting raw patterns, that's really the most common API that people have been exposed to.
[12:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm torn on having three methods vs. one.
[12:56:59] <rxaviers> Do you have an example?
[12:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> http://us2.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php
[12:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/
[13:00:03] <rxaviers> Are you saying we should keep Globalize.format to accept raw formats only, and having a second method to get the presets, right?
[13:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:02:32] <rxaviers> There are four different presets in CLDR: date (full, long, medium, short); time( full, ...), datetime (full, ...), and the availableFormats (etc...)
[13:02:47] <rxaviers> Do you have an example how a call should look like?
[13:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> Globalize.format( date, Globalize.resolveSkeleton( pattern ) )
[13:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> And then three more methods similar to resolveSkeleton?
[13:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> For date, time, datetime.
[13:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, what if we just have resolveSkeleton handle strings and objects and do the Twitter API?
[13:07:39] <rxaviers> Globalize.getDatePattern( "full" ), Globalize.getTimePattern( "full" ), Globalize.getDatetimePattern( "full" ) ?
[13:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, those are fine with me.

[13:10:38] <rxaviers> I can use those, but to be honest I think it's too verbose :-(... Before we get to those, I'm not happy to make raw patterns easier to be used than the presets on our Globalize.format. Although php uses it as you pointed above, ICU (the biggest backend implementation of CLDR), rails (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#adding-date-time-formats), and twitter-cldr does the opposite: use the preset by default. Using this preset instead of the act
[13:10:38] <rxaviers> ual raw is the correct way to go dealing with locales.
[13:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:11:52] <rxaviers> An example is our datepicker usage. To use the correct locale's format, we simply let globalize to parse the short format of whatever locale user chose.
[13:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, maybe Globalize.explicitFormat() for raw values :-P
[13:12:25] <rxaviers> \o/
[13:12:28] <rxaviers> better I think
[13:12:31] <rxaviers> hehe
[13:13:05] <rxaviers> A last call, what do you think if we request every format to be an object like this example:
[13:13:13] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, {skeleton: "GyMMM"})
[13:13:13] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, {pattern: "MMM y G"})
[13:13:13] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, {date: "full"})
[13:13:13] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, {time: "full"})
[13:13:13] <rxaviers> Globalize.format(date, {datetime: "full"})
[13:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose in the context of what Globalize is, it makes sense to have the "obvious" API be the one that forces you to use proper locale settings.
[13:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> I could live with that.
[13:13:50] <rxaviers> ok
