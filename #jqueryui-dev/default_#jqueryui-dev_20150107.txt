[05:29:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:36:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Pong!
[05:37:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:38:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6028, and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184 ...
[05:38:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's fixed toolbar + selectmenu.
[05:38:22] <arschmitz> i just commented on 5514
[05:38:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Aaah, OK. I'll read it first.
[05:38:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Aaah, OK.
[05:39:41] <gabriel_schulhof> So we're gonna drop it. Good. That should fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6028.
[05:40:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and I suppose people can hide manually on a per-application basis.
[05:40:50] <gabriel_schulhof>  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7902 is still relevant though, because stale .animationComplete() handlers should still not be called, if the toolbar's .show() and .hide() end up getting called one after the other in quick succession.
[05:41:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK, then I'll remove the .blur() from the select that's causing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6028.
[05:45:36] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, removing the .blur() may also fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184, assuming that we accept that the third item mentioned in my comment is indeed difficult if not impossible to implement.
[05:48:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I know there's probably a really good reason why, with a non-native select, the anchor gets all the keyboard events, whereas with a native select, the <select> gets all the keyboard events, but it also makes it impossible to select an <option> by pressing its initial letter.
[05:49:31] <arschmitz> that our fault
[05:49:34] <arschmitz> for not handling that
[05:50:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: AFAIK there's no way to get a character from a keyboard event.
[05:50:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: You only have keyCode, which is independent of keyboard layout.
[05:50:43] <gabriel_schulhof> For example, 88 is ":" on en_US, and "รถ" on fi_FI
[05:51:06] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and there's nothing in the keydown event that tells me what /character/ was pressed.
[05:51:44] <gabriel_schulhof> So, we'd have to have the <select> grab all the events and preventDefault() on Enter, Alt+Down, Space, etc. - events that would normally result in the native menu dropping down.
[05:52:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: that does not work i dont think
[05:52:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, I bet that's why non-native uses an anchor to grab all those events, rather than the <select> itself.
[05:53:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well you cant programaticly control open close of a select
[05:53:18] <arschmitz> so you cant allow anything to go to the select
[05:53:36] <arschmitz> unless its going to be native
[05:56:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/ribabu/1/
[05:56:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok? all your doing is preventing not controling
[05:56:42] <arschmitz> try to open the select :-)
[05:56:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, that's all I want for a non-native, because the opening is done via our own UI.
[05:57:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What I'm saying is that both native and non-native can share the same code, except the non-native prevents default on all the events - but the non-native doesn't need an anchor to absorb all the events.
[05:58:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Although it may still not work. For example, in http://jsbin.com/ribabu/2/ I cannot prevent the <select> from opening in response to Alt+Down in FF.
[05:58:29] <arschmitz> I dont follow how this would work at all 
[05:58:51] <arschmitz> on non native the select is hidden
[05:59:02] <arschmitz> so we need to focus the ancor and get clicks on the anchor
[05:59:03] <arschmitz> etc
[05:59:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yes, but it need not be - /if/ (a very big if) we can completely prevent the select from showing the native menu.
[05:59:40] <arschmitz> but we need to prevent it from showing at all
[05:59:42] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean the native select need not be hidden.
[05:59:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes. Agreed.
[06:00:02] <arschmitz> now i mean the whole thing needs to be hidden
[06:00:10] <arschmitz> thats the whole point of custom select
[06:00:17] <arschmitz> its a custom button and menu not the real one
[06:00:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wait a sec. The native select looks exactly like the custom select. If we can always prevent the native menu from dropping down, we don't need the anchor anymore.
[06:01:17] <gabriel_schulhof> We can show our popup insteal.
[06:01:19] <gabriel_schulhof> instead.
[06:02:48] <gabriel_schulhof> I guess what I'm saying is that the button need not be custom, because a native <select> that is completely prevented from dropping down is essentially just a button.
[06:03:22] <arschmitz> Honestly does not matter because we are switching to UI so any effort your putting into this should be on the ui widget
[06:04:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, as far as development goes, I agree. However, I think for 1.5.0 it might be good to fix some of the bugs.
[06:04:28] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and removing the .blur() will fix two of them.
[06:04:56] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or, rather, fix one, and do as much as possible for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3184 without going into widget redesign.
[06:05:37] <gabriel_schulhof> So the user's gonna have to click out of the select in Android Chrome to get her fixed toolbars back ... so what?
[06:06:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Anyway ... I'm gonna go grab some (late) lunch. BBIAB.

[07:25:48] <travis-ci> jquery/jquery-mobile#2239 (master - b54b7e4 : Cory Gackenheimer): The build was broken.

[07:26:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz scott_gonzalez: how about we make _add/remove/toggleClass chainable and chain calls to those methods, but leave everything else as-is and don't mix anything? So any _on calls would never be chained to an _addClass call
[07:27:15] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: im ok with that
[07:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:27:22] <arschmitz> i was not super crazy about it when i was writing it
[07:27:30] <arschmitz> but we tend to chain when possible so i did
[07:27:49] <arschmitz> but i agree the result is kinda awkward 
[07:28:06] <jzaefferer> I made it to slider.js so far
[07:28:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Yeah iv been following a lot of little things but nothing to major so far ?
[07:29:56] <jzaefferer> no, just many tiny details
[07:30:50] <jzaefferer> I'm using three tabs and my editor...
[07:31:08] <arschmitz> its kinda a massive pr it touches almost every file 
[07:32:01] <jzaefferer> yeah
[07:50:11] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: is there any content within the pointerevents repo that isn't subject to the MIT license (e.g. CC0, etc)?
[07:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Yes, https://github.com/jquery/PointerEvents/blob/master/LICENSE.txt#L33-L36
[07:53:01] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: perfect, thanks.  I need to clone the new repo, I think I'm pointing at an old one.
