[11:23:44] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6365 by robcaldecott (1d 4h ago): Popups containing textareas change height when characters typed
[11:24:08] <arschmitz> the missing min height i dont really think is the true issue here
[11:24:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh ok
[11:24:22] <arschmitz> its the same as text areas in panels collapsibles etc
[11:24:28] <arschmitz> where its hidden initally 
[11:24:37] <arschmitz> so we cant calculate the height
[11:25:06] <uGoMobi> so the issue would also happen with alpha 1 before we merged that PR?
[11:25:18] <arschmitz> yes 
[11:25:33] <arschmitz> well actually i take that back this would half fix the issue
[11:25:51] <arschmitz> if the textarea has content it will not fix it
[11:25:57] <arschmitz> but if it does not it would
[11:26:12] <arschmitz> so we should still set a min height 
[11:26:42] <arschmitz> we just need to make the min height exactly equal to that of an empty textinput that not hidden
[11:27:29] <uGoMobi> is a textarea two lines by default?
[11:27:43] <arschmitz> 2 lines plus 15 px or something
[11:27:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:28:35] <uGoMobi> that px value should change to em
[11:29:12] <arschmitz> ok 15 px is just what we always used
[11:29:30] <uGoMobi> yeah I know, I just realize we changed everything to em
[11:29:54] <uGoMobi> so we should do the same with the 15px
[11:30:09] <uGoMobi> or isn't that possible?
[11:30:12] <arschmitz> so really this needs to equal scrollHeight + borderHeight + 1em
[11:30:30] <arschmitz> oh yeah not sure how to do that
[11:30:38] <arschmitz> ok no this has to be px
[11:30:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, you're right
[11:30:54] <uGoMobi> we can't change it
[11:31:25] <arschmitz> so scrollHeight + borderHeight + 15 is what we need to make the default basicly
[11:31:50] <arschmitz> which is 59px
[11:32:22] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:32:32] <uGoMobi> we can convert that to em for the CSS
[11:32:39] <arschmitz> yea
[11:32:44] <uGoMobi> I think we set font size 14px
[11:33:20] <arschmitz> 16 im seeing 
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> .ui-mini .ui-input-text input,
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> .ui-mini .ui-input-search input,
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> .ui-input-text.ui-mini input,
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> .ui-input-search.ui-mini input,
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> .ui-mini textarea.ui-input-text,
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> textarea.ui-mini {
[11:33:39] <uGoMobi> 	font-size: 14px;
[11:33:40] <uGoMobi> }
[11:33:52] <uGoMobi> sorry
[11:34:20] <arschmitz> oh for mini yeah 14
[11:34:25] <arschmitz> but regular is 16
[11:34:29] <uGoMobi> yeah it's 16
[11:34:52] <arschmitz> hmm hold on though
[11:35:04] <uGoMobi> I saw it after I pasted and accidently pressed enter
[11:35:10] <arschmitz> the textarea changes size slightly when you enter first character 
[11:35:16] <arschmitz> even normally
[11:35:21] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:35:24] <arschmitz> i want to fix that first
[11:35:34] <arschmitz> seperate issue but still an issue
[11:35:58] <uGoMobi> do you also see it on FF?
[11:36:13] <arschmitz> let me check
[11:36:14] <uGoMobi> not sure if Chrome still has does weird rounding issues
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> yes i do it shrinks
[11:37:19] <arschmitz> oh i see why
[11:37:36] <arschmitz> we dont set the size via js at first and just leave it to the css
[11:37:54] <arschmitz> so then when first char is entered js sets it and its not the same

[11:41:07] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6294 by jhogervorst (2w 2d ago): Autogrow: adds padding omitted from clientHeight by Firefox
[11:41:39] <uGoMobi> looks like we explicitly set 0px
[11:41:46] <uGoMobi> for the height
[11:42:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes but that only happens after first key press
[11:42:12] <arschmitz> to calculate new height
[11:42:13] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[11:42:39] <uGoMobi> thought _updateHeight was also called on init
[11:42:50] <uGoMobi> but I guess I was wrong
[11:42:51] <arschmitz> nope which is actually the problem i think
[11:43:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we need to call updateHeight on pageshow i think
[11:44:18] <arschmitz> or.... adjust the css to make it the right height by default
[11:45:40] <uGoMobi> if we expose updateHeight people can also call it when on popupopen, panelopen, etc
[11:45:49] <arschmitz> yup
[11:46:00] <uGoMobi> to resolve the problem when a textarea contains text
[11:46:42] <arschmitz> yes but to resolve issue with changing on first char what do you think i would lean towards css solution
[11:47:49] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[11:49:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its the lineheight
[11:49:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if i change textarea.ui-input-text to have line-height:1em it goes away
[11:50:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm well it goes away in chrome but does nothing in firefox :(
[11:50:46] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:51:08] <uGoMobi> yeah, I can't imagine that's the actual cause
[11:58:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmmm i can also fix in chrome by adjusting margins but no effect in firefox

[12:05:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on Chrome the textarea is 59px when you open it, the JS sets 52px when you start typing
[12:05:53] <arschmitz> yes
[12:05:59] <arschmitz> thats what im trying to fix
[12:06:48] <uGoMobi> yeah, just checking if we both see the same :)
[12:07:12] <uGoMobi> I wonder if it has to do with box-sizing
[12:08:42] <uGoMobi> but then I would expect the difference to be equal to the padding and/or the border-size
[12:09:01] <arschmitz> i tried messing with that too
[12:09:08] <arschmitz> i can fix like 3 ways in chrome
[12:09:15] <arschmitz> but in FF nothing seems to work :(

[12:25:28] <uGoMobi> what do you think?
[12:25:38] <arschmitz> im fine with it can always reopen
[12:25:49] <arschmitz> but then i dont have to remeber to go close them if they never respond
[12:25:50] <uGoMobi> exactly
[12:26:02] <uGoMobi> that's the idea :)
[12:27:50] <uGoMobi> and we only have to re-open if we think it's a bug

[12:28:02] <uGoMobi> like that "my app doesn't work" ticket that you just closed

[12:33:05] <arschmitz> would you tag something like that as fixed there is no real issue to "fix" just noted it in changelog basicly there is no commit or anything
[12:33:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm
[12:34:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we need another label for that
[12:34:41] <arschmitz> yeah 
[12:34:54] <arschmitz> like Notice: or something lol
[12:34:58] <uGoMobi> looks weird if you have Fixed: deprecated blah blah in the changelog
[12:35:04] <arschmitz> i agree
[12:35:40] <arschmitz> Notice: deprecated blah blah does not seem to bad though
[12:36:07] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds good
[13:07:41] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez either of you have recommendations for tracking down errors in IE7 … really struggling with it since all the browser gives you is some generated line number in the html file which i assume is based on inlining the js or something but it's pretty useless
[13:08:18] <kborchers> LOL thanks DaveMethvin|away :P
[13:09:27] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> Use a super powered IE7 with dev tools.
[13:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> You should get real data then.
[13:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty sure Browserstack IE7 has dev tools.
[13:10:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: don't help
[13:10:52] <kborchers> they have "devtools" but no console
[13:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't have the break on error debugging?
[13:11:48] <kborchers> firing it back up to check again
[13:13:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: not that i can see unless i'm  missing it http://cl.ly/image/2W1k3Q3J211x
[13:14:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just when through all the closed 1.4 issues and added fixed tags for things that were fixed tags
[13:15:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: Only thing script related i see is a menu option to "Disable Script" which fixes the error but … ;P
[13:15:05] <uGoMobi> kborchers: I know there is a tool IETester with DebugBar extension that has a console
[13:15:26] <kborchers> uGoMobi: hmmm, but then i actually have to have IE7 right? :/
[13:15:39] <uGoMobi> kborchers: no
[13:15:40] <kborchers> or is that it's own thing?
[13:15:48] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:16:20] <kborchers> uGoMobi: oh, i think i remember that tool … i think i also remember it not being 100% accurate … like it's not actually IE7 but like IE9 acting like it or something
[13:16:45] <kborchers> i'll check it out though
[13:16:46] <kborchers> thanks
[13:16:49] <arschmitz> kborchers: iv used that its better then ie9 in ie7 but still not actually ie7
[13:17:02] <arschmitz> as far as being accurate 
[13:17:56] <kborchers> arschmitz: ok, i'll look at it but i need something that is accurate ie7 since i'm trying to implement PointerEvent stuff
[13:18:15] <arschmitz> yeah its not 100% thats for sure
[13:18:36] <kborchers> yeah, this sucks
[13:19:02] <uGoMobi> kborchers: looks like you can only run it on windows and you need to have an IE version installed
[13:19:11] <kborchers> :/
[13:19:15] * kborchers goes back to college days delivering pizzas
[13:19:22] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:19:39] <kborchers> such a simpler time
[13:21:07] <arschmitz> back when cross browser js was so bad it almost was not worth writing it .....
[13:22:06] <uGoMobi> I just read there is Firebug Lite for IE7, would be nice if browserstack could install that
[13:22:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you can run it from a link
[13:22:21] <arschmitz> but it does not do JS
[13:22:36] <arschmitz> its really just for poking around the dom
[13:22:45] <uGoMobi> ohw :/
[13:22:55] <kborchers> yeah, it's there in browserstack but yeah, just as useless
[13:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: What about Firebug lite?
[13:23:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[13:23:32] <uGoMobi> have to down vote this answer then http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16112345/developer-tools-in-ie7-to-view-console-log-messages
[13:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, just read the rest of the converstaion.
[13:24:16] <kborchers> ok, i'm going to go do some non-computer stuff with my son for a bit then bash my head against the wall more later … any ideas appreciated just drop them here
[13:24:18] <kborchers> thanks all
[13:24:32] <arschmitz> kborchers: have fun 
[13:27:05] <arschmitz> kborchers: generally in the past iv resorted to just alerts for ie7 :(
[13:29:22] <uGoMobi> I think _|Nix|_ wrote a simple script to export console log messages to a file
[13:29:49] <uGoMobi> for mobile debugging, but could be useful for IE7 too
[13:30:19] <kborchers> yeah both of those would be pretty rough solutions too since i'm tracking down issues deep inside polymer :/
[13:30:26] <kborchers> ok really heading out now
[13:30:34] <uGoMobi> later kborchers

[14:30:55] <scott_gonzalez> _zoggy_: If you want that one blank line removed, you can file an issue specifically for that.
[14:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> If you want comments to be consistent, that'd be in jquery-ui, not in download builder.
[14:32:40] <_zoggy_> ok, I can strip out the CSS comment part and leave the rest
[14:32:51] <_zoggy_> wouldnt combing rules be part of TR ?
[14:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but unless you have a tool that will do it, it's not going to happen.
[14:33:32] <_zoggy_> well clean-css / recess would do it. but dunno how youd you guys feel about including 3rd party libs
