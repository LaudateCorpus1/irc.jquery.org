[05:20:57] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi
[05:21:04] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:30:37] <tj_vantoll> Do we support nested dropppables? For example:
[05:30:37] <tj_vantoll> <ul>
[05:30:37] <tj_vantoll>   <li>One
[05:30:37] <tj_vantoll>     <ul><li>Two</li>
[05:30:37] <tj_vantoll>   </li>
[05:30:37] <tj_vantoll> </ul>
[05:30:38] <tj_vantoll> $( "li" ).droppable({ â€¦ });
[05:31:25] <tj_vantoll> I know droppable supports overlapping drop zones but I don't believe it supports parent/child drop zones. I'm not positive though.
[05:40:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[06:02:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: had to tag https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6629#issuecomment-26583338 DBR
[06:02:49] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6629 by existeam (4h 4m ago): Play musics and videos
[06:05:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I should have asked if he meant that he wants some nice background music while developing with jQuery Mobile ;-)
[06:07:12] <arschmitz> lol
[06:16:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill look at those button issues today
[06:16:40] <arschmitz> and pr's
[06:16:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thanks
[06:18:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621 is proving rather tricky ... for some reason, if I move the popup upon opening, the list item in a dialog in a custom select ends up receiving the click that opened the custom select, and the dialog closes right away.
[06:18:33] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (19h 5m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[06:18:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bizarre ... 
[06:19:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But the fact is that I'd rather close that bug by explaining that the popup relocates itself and so the OP should enhance the popup contents before enhancing the whole injected div.
[06:19:26] <arschmitz> weird
[06:19:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Especially at this late stage.
[06:19:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: +1
[06:19:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah - thank goodness for integration tests.
[06:19:55] <arschmitz> i wouldnt close
[06:20:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why not? There is a solution that does not require changes to the library.
[06:21:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm pretty sure the fact that the popup relocates itself is documented.
[06:21:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we can point to that.
[06:21:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's only inconvenient that you cannot enhance the whole thing in one go, not necessarily incorrect.
[06:22:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just a sec need to get son 
[06:23:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see! So he's the one who's been helping you! No wonder you've been able to get so much done! :)
[06:23:27] <arschmitz> lol
[06:23:47] <arschmitz> i think its a bug personally
[06:24:24] <arschmitz> that based on alphabetical order 3 specific widgets dont enhance
[06:25:35] <uGoMobi> is this issue the same https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6624
[06:25:35] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Pull request #6624 by allsteady (8h 30m ago): The Filterable have not worked properly when filter-reveal type is 'true' in some case.
[06:25:37] <uGoMobi> ?
[06:26:35] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[06:27:49] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:27:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IMO it's popup's fault. The fact that it rips parts of the scope of .enhanceWithin() out of that scope before .enhanceWithin() completes.
[06:28:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No other widget does that.
[06:28:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i completely agree
[06:28:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : we can leave the ticket open but I agree we shouldn't make such a big change just before RC, especially since a workaround is available (http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/651/edit)
[06:28:27] <arschmitz> and i think it is a bug
[06:28:39] <arschmitz> i would leave open and just document the issue and workaround
[06:28:55] <arschmitz> but just because there is  a work around does not mean its fixed or not an issue
[06:29:21] <uGoMobi> true
[06:29:41] <arschmitz> i dont think we should fix now since the simple solution did not work
[06:29:47] <arschmitz> but we should try for 1.4.1
[06:29:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think this is a limitation of the popup widget, not necessarily an issue.
[06:30:18] <arschmitz> maybe but i think its fixable
[06:30:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about recording all elements at the begining of .enhanceWithin() and then iterating over the existing collection?
[06:31:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but it's only a problem with popup
[06:31:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, enhanceWithin: function() { elements = this.find( "*" ); ... } and then elements.find( $.mobile.widgets[ index ].initSelector )[ index ]();
[06:32:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm 
[06:32:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: .find( "*" ) is expensive ...
[06:33:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but this would support tracking objects as they move outside the scope of .enhanceWithin()
[06:33:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its not a bad idea just trying to think if there is a better way
[06:33:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's true. Only popup moves DOM elements around in such a way that they can escape the scope of a .enhanceWithin() call.
[06:34:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, so I am not sure if we should do something that affects performance in all cases enhanceWithin() is used
[06:34:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. enhanceWithin() is performance critical, so we have to be really careful with the changes we make.
[06:35:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why it'd be good to find an elegant alternative.
[06:35:47] <uGoMobi> but I suggest we look into this issue again later, for 1.4.1 or 1.5 depending on what kind of change we have in mind
[06:35:59] <uGoMobi> we should leave everything that is not critical
[06:36:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have a few ideas i want to look into for this
[06:36:12] <uGoMobi> and this issue isn't because there is a workaround
[06:36:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:36:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so i think it should wait for 1.4.1
[06:36:39] <arschmitz> might have an idea that would actually improve overall performance and support this
[06:37:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.helpers.js#L196
[06:37:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: write it down so don't forget it ;-)
[06:37:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Shouldn't the constructor be restricted to /this/.
[06:37:38] <_|Nix|_> OK. Let's milestone it for 1.4.1
[06:37:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ?
[06:37:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes it should for sure
[06:38:04] <arschmitz> should be $(this).find(....
[06:38:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 
[06:38:09] <uGoMobi> oops
[06:38:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just removed 1.4.0 milestone
[06:38:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when we set 1.4.1, let's note in a comment that it's not a promise it will be fixed by then
[06:39:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's the difference between $( $.fn.buttonMarkup.initSelector, this ) and $( this ).find( $.fn.buttonMarkup.initSelector )?
[06:39:05] <uGoMobi> if it's a bigger change then we might not want to land it in a maintenance release
[06:39:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is there a performance diff?
[06:40:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... isn't /this/ already a jQuery object? Then you can just this.find( $.fn.buttonMarkup.initSelector ), not?

[06:41:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll take care of the commenting for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621.
[06:41:01] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (19h 28m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[06:41:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes it is
[06:41:18] <arschmitz> sorry this.find(...
[06:41:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, thanks
[06:41:30] <arschmitz> just like i do for fieldcontain below
[06:43:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually it should also be using jqmenhanceable not .not( keepnative 
[06:45:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Riiiight! Yeah ... just like fieldcontain below it :)
[06:46:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know, why don't we run jqmEnhanceable first and then .find( widgetSpecificSelector )?
[06:46:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way, we can do it once.
[06:46:46] <arschmitz> yup
[06:48:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oooh ... same thing for links, but it's a bit trickier because links is in a different file ...
[06:48:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i wouldnt worry about links
[06:48:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we would need something like $.mobile.links = function( target, alreadyFilteredForEnhanceable ) {};
[06:49:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but isn't calling jqmEnhanceable() many times on the same (potentially large?) set of elements bad?
[06:49:33] <arschmitz> yeah not worth it this late when its deprecated already
[06:49:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good point.
[06:49:56] <arschmitz> do it for the calls within enhancewithin fine
[06:50:00] <arschmitz> thats very simple
[06:50:04] <arschmitz> just not for links
[06:51:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... I wonder where the code that adds the ARIA attributes for popup links is going to end up ...
[06:52:04] <arschmitz> probably should have people add themselves
[06:52:19] <arschmitz> just like they have to data-rel
[06:55:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oooh, but then we need to mark that as deprected too ... the fact that popup-related aria-attributes are added by the framework ...
[06:55:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[06:55:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wasent links already marked as deprecated?
[06:56:18] <uGoMobi> we deprecated ui-link
[06:56:34] <uGoMobi> I don't think we said link.js
[06:57:22] <uGoMobi> we can't deprecate anymore now, so worse case we have to keep links.js in 1.5 just to add ARIA roles
[06:59:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suppose the code could be moved to popup: $.mobile.popup.enhanceLinks()
[07:00:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and then, in .enhanceWithin(), if ( $.mobile.popup ) { $.mobile.popup.enhanceLinks( this ); }
[07:00:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[07:00:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah probably
[07:00:49] <arschmitz> ok my misunderstanding
[07:01:18] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think we should deprecate more
[07:01:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll add this solution to the bug about popup link handling I created for 1.5.0.
[07:02:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: perfect
[07:02:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then we can get rid of js/jquery.mobile.links.js altogether.
[07:02:30] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:13:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you want me to file an issue about the make-buttonMarkup-more-like-fieldcontain-and-factor-out-jqmEnhanceable changes?
[07:13:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure
[07:13:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[07:14:04] <arschmitz> im doing some perf testing on different methods of storing elements for enhancewithin
[07:14:16] <arschmitz> .filter("*") is really really bad
[07:16:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In that case, I can take care of this change to .enhanceWithin(), if you'd like.
[07:16:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: either way
[07:17:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I'll file the issue first, anyway.
[07:18:03] <arschmitz> sounds good
[07:20:37] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6630: Helpers: Pass the correct elements to buttonMarkup and reduce calls to jqmEnhanceable  02http://git.io/_axHsg
[07:22:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: by the way think i have a perf firendly solution
[07:24:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, nice!
[07:25:00] <arschmitz> actually its slightly faster
[07:25:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do tell!
[07:25:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang! Faster than .find( "*" ) or faster than what we have now?
[07:25:18] <arschmitz> use $.each at begining
[07:25:24] <arschmitz> what we have now
[07:25:28] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[07:25:38] <_|Nix|_> Do it! Do it now! :)
[07:25:42] <arschmitz> in the each go through the init selectors
[07:25:53] <arschmitz> and do the search then
[07:25:59] <arschmitz> and store the set to an object
[07:26:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Aha!, and then call the widget on each set.
[07:26:25] <arschmitz> so you do all your traversing before anything happens and save the results
[07:26:30] <arschmitz> yup
[07:26:32] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[07:26:35] <_|Nix|_> Brilliant!
[07:26:39] <_|Nix|_> You da man!
[07:26:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and the faster part
[07:26:46] <arschmitz> is use filter not find
[07:26:48] <AlexanderBB10> https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/1395859_513333445425114_2027315511_n.jpg
[07:27:06] <arschmitz> seems to be very slightly faster
[07:27:31] <arschmitz> AlexanderBB10: have an issue with that solution?
[07:27:42] <arschmitz> or just all of us in general lol?
[07:27:43] <AlexanderBB10> nop
[07:27:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec. Filter does not traverse down the tree ...
[07:28:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thought it did?
[07:28:21] <arschmitz> let me check that
[07:28:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. Filter checks each member of the collection to see whether it matches a certain selector.
[07:28:46] <arschmitz> oh right so scratch that
[07:28:54] <arschmitz> so its the same performance as now then
[07:29:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, except without https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621.
[07:29:04] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (20h 16m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[07:29:09] <arschmitz> exactly
[07:29:14] <_|Nix|_> Very nice!
[07:29:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and without any future "Lemme just move that one DOM element to Mars" problems.
[07:29:39] <arschmitz> yup
[07:30:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: however
[07:30:12] <arschmitz> this could expose issues we are unaware of
[07:30:24] <arschmitz> if a widget depends on another widget to chnace something it injects
[07:30:30] <arschmitz> this will no longer enhance it
[07:30:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I'm gonna need to be sure about that "chnace" :)
[07:31:17] <arschmitz> enhance*
[07:31:33] <arschmitz> bad typing lol
[07:31:52] <arschmitz> i think we fixed all cases of this
[07:32:03] <arschmitz> but if we haven't this will expose it 
[07:32:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should not happen. We always enhance explicitly.
[07:32:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In fact, we instantiate explicitly as of 1.5.0.
[07:32:36] <arschmitz> right SHOULD not happen
[07:32:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We don't even rely on .enhanceWithin() - except in page.
[07:32:53] <arschmitz> but does not mean we didnt miss something since we did it in the past
[07:33:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: True.
[07:33:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, good. Let's expose it if we've missed it.
[07:33:28] <arschmitz> yeah should show up immediately when running tests
[07:34:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Very nice. Wanna comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621 so we don't forget this solution?
[07:34:07] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (20h 21m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[07:34:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: since its a simple fix and we agreed it is a bug i wonder if i should just fix it rather then wait
[07:34:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might even move the bug from "Popup" to "Widgets" or something.
[07:34:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what do you think?
[07:35:16] * uGoMobi is reading back now
[07:35:21] <arschmitz> its a five minute fix
[07:35:49] <arschmitz> plus 20 to run tests ha ha ha
[07:35:54] <_|Nix|_> :)
[07:36:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we do this you can mark both https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6630 as history.
[07:36:35] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (20h 23m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[07:36:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, overall we'll gain performance because of the reduction in .jqmEnhanceable() calls.
[07:37:01] <arschmitz> yup
[07:39:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds like a nice solution
[07:40:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man ... degradeInputsWithin also uses .not( $.mobile.page.prototype.keepNativeSelector() )
[07:40:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you feel comfortable to make the change at this stage?
[07:40:22] <arschmitz> yes as long as tests pass
[07:41:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we are pretty sure we removed anything that this would negativly effect and if we didnt tests will faill 
[07:41:20] <uGoMobi> right
[07:41:28] <arschmitz> and it fixes a bug
[07:41:55] <_|Nix|_> ... and it improves perf - although I dunno if it's by a lot.
[07:43:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: a lot if ignorecontentenabled is off
[07:43:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another minor tweak. You can call $.mobile.page.prototype.keepNativeSelector() once outside the for-each-widget-in-$.mobile.widgets loop - even if it's just for backcompat.
[07:43:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was already going to do that
[07:44:04] <arschmitz> but thank you :)
[07:44:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, sweet!
[07:44:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and while that is backcompat it will have a replacement
[07:44:44] <arschmitz> it will just be .not( $.mobile.keepNative ) instead
[07:44:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but the replacement is a value, so you can "call" that any number of times you want.
[07:44:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[07:45:10] <arschmitz> still faster to only call it once
[07:45:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? Derefing is not cached?
[07:45:51] <arschmitz> it is but its still function call overhead
[07:46:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right. NM. I'm an idiot ... it's the same optimization as calling .jqmEnhanceable() first.
[07:46:31] <arschmitz> so not much faster but faster
[07:47:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess it's a good heuristic: Eliminate those elements that you know you will not touch, before repeatedly iterating over a set of elements.
[07:55:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know ... Off the top of my head, I'm thinking this might also fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6624 ... looking into it now, but it also sounds like an enhancement order issue.

[08:26:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6624 is different. It's still an enhancement-order problem, but it's different. With filter-reveal, the filter assigns a pile of ui-screen-hidden classes to the unenhanced checkboxradio widgets which, when enhanced, are not themselves ui-screen-hidden (that is, the ui-checkbox wrapper that encloses the label and the input does not have ui-screen-hidden), but their child <label> and
[08:26:32] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6624 by allsteady (10h 31m ago): The Filterable have not worked properly when filter-reveal type is 'true' in some case.
[08:27:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I could put a special case inside checkboxradio to eradicate ui-screen-hidden from the label and the input, but to add it to the wrapper if found.
[08:28:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but the fundamental problem is that filterable filters once during _create(), at which point all of its children may not have been turned into widgets yet.
[08:28:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no this is an issue with filter not checkbox radio
[08:28:37] <arschmitz> and checkboxradio should not care about or special case for filterable
[08:28:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but how can filterable know that its children will eventually turn into checkboxradio widgets?
[08:29:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that it should only filter them once that process has completed.
[08:29:18] <arschmitz> maybe it just shouldnt work on them
[08:29:38] <arschmitz> and checkboxradio will likely be in ui very soon where filterable does not even exist yet
[08:29:40] <jzaefferer> tj_vantoll arschmitz: I've started a little gist to collect PR boilerplate responses. Hopefully we can automate these in the not so distant future.

[08:54:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: NO!!
[08:54:47] <arschmitz> nothing should use enhanceWithin execpt page
[08:55:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think filterable should just not work on checkboxradio
[08:55:57] <arschmitz> if someone wants it to wrap it in a div or span or something else
[08:58:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I had the same thought ... so, I guess we need to document the fact that widgets inside the filterable may or may not be enhanced at the time of its creation, so it's up to the dev to make sure they're enhanced.
[08:58:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: In general I think it sucks that we can't have utility methods that are used from multiple widgets, unless those utility methods are part of core.
[08:59:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: like what
[08:59:41] <arschmitz> ?

[08:59:42] <jquicommit> 13jquery-ui/06master 14b99f825 15onovy: Demos: Fixed small typo.
[09:01:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like enhanceWithin ... we're going out of our way in controlgroup, and now filterable to avoid using it, when all it would take is to factor it out into its own file and AMD-depend on it.
[09:01:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we could gain generic container widgets that are totally widget-aware.
[09:01:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because that would never be part of ui
[09:02:18] <arschmitz> and then when the widget moves to ui it would have to be taken out anyway
[09:03:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So let's not merge any container widgets. That would leave us with page, controlgroup, filterable, and collapsible.
[09:03:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, seriously. If UI defines a widget as a layer of functionality above plain DOM, then we cannot submit anything that uses widgets inside of it.
[09:04:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... Anything that's supposed to be generic, anyway.
[09:04:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all of those have a place in ui
[09:05:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: controlgroup in some form will likely eventually replace buttonset
[09:05:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: collapsible is just an accordian with one pane
[09:06:24] <arschmitz> and filterable is just a general utility like draggable and resizable 
[09:08:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and both filterable and checkboxradio work exactly as intended
[09:08:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know that, but as you can see, both controlgroup and filterable depend on their children being turned into widgets beforehand in order to work correctly.
[09:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, in the case of controlgroup, we can enhance each child widget we claim to support in turn, but filterable is supposed to be totally generic.
[09:09:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and in filterble it works correctly
[09:09:32] <arschmitz> it should do exactly what it is
[09:10:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess autoinit is at the root of all this.
[09:10:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[09:10:30] <arschmitz> which has nothing to do with individual widgets
[09:10:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this is fixable by the dev in several ways
[09:11:11] <arschmitz> they could call checkboxradio themselves on pagebeforecreate
[09:11:19] <arschmitz> they could wrap it in any other element
[09:12:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess in that case the solution to this is to document. I'll write it up in API docs and give https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6624 as an example of where autoinit has its limitations.
[09:12:49] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6624 by allsteady (11h 17m ago): The Filterable have not worked properly when filter-reveal type is 'true' in some case.
[09:13:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think thats best
[09:15:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they could also set wrapperClass to ui-screen-hidden

[09:15:36] <doesallmagic2> joern.zaefferer: Demos: Fixed small typo.
[09:16:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or refresh the filterable themselves on create
[09:17:06] <arschmitz> pagecreate that is
[09:25:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not even: 			$( document ).on( "pagebeforecreate", "#revelMode", function( event ) { $( "#checkboxes", event.target ).enhanceWithin(); });
[09:25:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should not encourage people to use enhanceWithin
[09:25:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its there if they want but its not good for performance so we should not encourage it
[09:26:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Then I'll replace that with $( "#checkboxes" ).find( "input" ).checkboxradio();
[09:27:19] <arschmitz> yeah much better

[13:59:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it was a rebase there were several commits in that test run
[13:59:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I see it now
[13:59:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: couldn't imagine that change to fix disabled was the cause
[14:00:22] <arschmitz> nope its the change to initSelector
[14:01:55] <arschmitz> still dont see the problem its gotta be some sort of typo
[14:01:56] <uGoMobi> I'll say... revert
[14:02:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, don't see it either
[14:02:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but if it's a typo I would expect all tests to fail, not only the one against 1.8
[14:03:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its a script error im guessing its something when jquery tries to parse that init selector
[14:03:17] <arschmitz> and it was probably fixed in 1.9
[14:05:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you going to revert?
[14:05:42] <arschmitz> probably unless i can see what the issue is
[14:06:03] <uGoMobi> I have a commit that I want to push, but it can wait
[14:06:41] <uGoMobi> setting icon to false in that listview extension killed all listview icons

[14:25:03] <arschmitz> only add them
[14:25:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I could have thought about that myself
[14:25:26] <uGoMobi> anyway, fixed it already
[14:25:33] <arschmitz> cool
[14:25:58] <uGoMobi> removed the data-role="listview" from those nested lists
[14:28:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i cant see what but something was changed in that init selector
[14:28:17] <arschmitz> i can put it all back in one line and it still does not work
[14:28:30] <uGoMobi> huh, that's weird
[14:28:33] <arschmitz> however if i copy the line
[14:28:40] <arschmitz> from before it works fine
[14:29:02] <arschmitz> so _|Nix|_ accidentally changed more then breaking onto lines
[14:34:43] <_|Nix|_> Oh no ... what did I change?
[14:36:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I put the textarea to the end of the selector.
[14:36:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: something when you broke textinput initselector onto multiple lines
[14:36:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... the textarea was not the last item in the comma list.
[14:36:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But that shouldn't matter.
[14:37:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not usre if thats it or not but something breaks 1.8.3

[14:58:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you have .enhaceWithin() open in an editor?
[14:59:02] <arschmitz> i know what i did it will only take a minute to redo it
[14:59:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i might 
[14:59:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then by all means hit Cancel when it offers to reload from disk.
[14:59:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: I DO! and i didnt even save my last change so it didnt even want to reload!
[14:59:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bam!
[15:00:02] <arschmitz> nice 
[15:00:06] <arschmitz> time to commit that lol
[15:00:15] <_|Nix|_> *phew*

[15:08:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: DOH!
[15:08:52] <arschmitz> we cant call enhanceable and .not( keepnative once at start
[15:09:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: those filter the actual element called on not its children
[15:10:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, hold on a minute ... we need to iterate over all the children of the collection passed in at some point. No avoiding that.
[15:10:31] <arschmitz> no we never iterate every one 
[15:10:35] <arschmitz> we just do a find
[15:10:41] <arschmitz> for specific selectors
[15:11:03] <arschmitz> this has to be after each find
[15:11:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and that's actually bad, because we go down subtrees more than once.
[15:11:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, we must be doing at least one .find( "*" )'s worth of work.
[15:11:59] <arschmitz> not sure ill have to set up a new perf test
[15:12:04] <arschmitz> and check
[15:12:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because, for each and every direct and indirect child of the element(s) passed in, we must determine whether it's a widget.
[15:15:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, we should do this.find( 
[15:15:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NM ... I was checking up on that ...
[15:15:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Too bad find doesn't take a callback ...
[15:16:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How are you testing perf on this?
[15:21:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... I see now ... none of our methods descend into the tree except the initSelectors ...

[15:28:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can definitely call .jqmEnhanceable() on the object passed into .enhanceWithin(), because if any of the objects in the collection are not enhanceable, neither will their children be.
