[07:29:27] <RobertPlummerMob> Hey Guys!
[07:30:19] <RobertPlummerMob> I was talking with Jorn and he pointed out that a plugin that I worked on sometime back would be useful in jQuery UI, it is an event, very simple. jQuery.fn.visible.  What do you guys think?
[07:30:55] <RobertPlummerMob> I find that I need it almost any time I start working on complex scenarios using jQuery UI, I figure there has to be many others with the same needs.
[07:38:33] <jzaefferer> RobertPlummerMob: Let's say "might be useful", haven't actually looked at it
[07:38:39] <jzaefferer> a link to the plugin would help for that
[07:56:34] <RobertPlummerMob> jzaefferer: Thanks for the correction.

[07:58:57] <RobertPlummerMob> FOr it to be integrated into jQuery UI, I think it would need a few more bits of functionality, but as of right now, it seems to work pretty well.
[08:07:36] <jzaefferer> to integrate existing code into jQuery UI usually involves a rewrite...
[08:09:06] <jzaefferer> so it just waits for the element to become visible?
[08:09:16] <jzaefferer> with a 500ms interval?
[08:39:33] <RobertPlummerMob> jzaefferer: Yup, nothing super complex.
[08:40:29] <RobertPlummerMob> jzaefferer: I thought about a tie in to $.fn.show & $.fn.hide, but there are so many ways of making somethign visible/hidden.
[08:41:08] <jzaefferer> Yeah, but I also don't see how this would be a good fit for UI
[08:41:25] <jzaefferer> Only useful in the context of an application using widgets
[08:41:40] <jzaefferer> If you know that you need to wait for visiblity, this may be a valid approach
[08:41:52] <jzaefferer> though if you know when they become visible, you don't need polling
[08:55:17] <RobertPlummerMob> jzaefferer: That is true, you have a good point.  I just figured it would be easier for many situations.
[09:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> What use cases does that solve?
[09:02:31] <jzaefferer> Initializing an accordion inside a hidden container, I guess
[09:02:40] <jzaefferer> While not really solving it, more of a userland workaround
[09:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's a broken workaround though
[09:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> It might work if it checks for animation too.
[09:18:35] <RobertPlummerMob> It checks for visibility, so animation would/should be detected.
[09:30:36] <RobertPlummerMob> Well thanks for the consideration guys.
[09:32:21] <RobertPlummerMob> I found it very useful within tiki, which of coarse is why it exists there, but I think tabs and anything inside them is where the real value comes in.
[09:33:17] <RobertPlummerMob> I think too once you have jQuery grid where the value of a cell has to be created at startup, but with multiu sheets, it may not be visible, like in the instance of a chart, it would be useful.
[09:33:26] <RobertPlummerMob> Because a cell won't know when it becomes visible.
[09:34:30] <RobertPlummerMob> But there are always work arounds, some are easier than others.
[09:58:12] <scott_gonzalez> RobertPlummerMob: The problem with your solution is that it doesn't account for doing things where height matters and the visibility is toggled with an animation.
[09:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> For example, if you wanted to initialize a nested accordion.
[09:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> The timeout might run in the middle of the animation, and the nested accordion would be initialized incorrectly.
[10:01:22] <RobertPlummerMob> so we'd want to execute only after animation, not a big problem, right?
[10:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> That probably works.
[10:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> Something like this.closest(":animated").length
[10:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> That might cover all cases.
[10:09:24] <RobertPlummerMob> So after that is added, what do you guys think? Possibly new utility event in jQuery UI?
[10:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'd want to see a lot of people requesting it first.
[10:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> A good first step would be making it actually be an event.
[10:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, then we have the problem of creating events that might clash with future standards.
