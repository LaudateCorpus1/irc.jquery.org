[13:51:51] <rpflo> maybe I just cant' find this, but is there no way to programmatically sort a sortable list?
[13:52:37] <rpflo> because if not, seems like you should be able to, and have it fire all relevant events.
[14:01:35] <gnarf> rpflo i don't think it exists, but you could prolly mixin on the prototype pretty easliy
[14:34:22] <rpflo> what is this .simulate method I'm seeing in the specs?
[14:34:37] <rpflo> like simulate('drag') is that a helper for the specs?
[14:43:04] <gnarf> jQuery.event.simulate ?
[14:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: What do you mean?
[14:45:00] <rpflo> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/sortable/sortable_events.js#L13
[14:45:22] <gnarf> thats the simulate plugin we wrote for testing events
[14:45:27] <rpflo> I'm trying to write a spec for our app, but can't for the life of me figure out how to simulate a drag event (with selenium or JavaScript)
[14:45:51] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[14:46:13] <rpflo> yeah, when I drop that simulate plugin onto the page and try to simulate drag on the `handle` or the sortable element, nothing happens
[14:47:26] <rpflo> oh, so I could simulate 'change' or 'drag' or whatever, these are widget custom events, not dom events
[14:47:38] <gnarf> rpflo: is the element actually "visible" ?
[14:47:48] <gnarf> rpflo: well "drag" is a meta event in simulate
[14:47:48] <rpflo> hm, probably not
[14:47:49] <rpflo> good call
[14:48:19] <gnarf> it actually makes a mousedown on the target, 3 mousemoves on the document and then a mouseup/click on the target
[14:48:28] <rpflo> ah, gnarf, you're my hero
[14:48:32] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.simulate.js#L135-153
[14:48:40] <rpflo> just had to show the thing
[15:19:08] <talntid> Anyone for hire want to develop a jquery plugin for me? It's a menu system, where you wrap the menu items around a cylinder, and rotate them based on 2 buttons... then when the desired menu item is in front, you click it, and it will open the page. If so, PM me :)
