[00:29:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! Good news from Korea: They were able to reduce jQM-based demo app startup time by 64ms by removing a bunch of $.extend calls. PR coming up.
[00:29:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome!
[00:30:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can't wait to see the PR.
[00:30:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We use a lot of $.extend especially during _create, and I guess we should stop :)
[00:30:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, declare instance-level vars on the proto instead of doing $.extend in _create.
[00:31:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But we'll see where else they've found that removing it helps performance.
[00:32:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I am curious

[06:11:30] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:11:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[06:23:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Ping!
[06:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[06:23:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Hey! Is it possible for the default attribute of an option to refer to an attribute of the entry?
[06:23:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: <placeholder> tags are used in the body, but I suspect they cannot be used in attribute values.
[06:24:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I want to factor out an option entry whose default value depends on the widget.
[06:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> You can't do it with just an attribute, but you can do it with an entire node.
[06:24:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: How do you mean?
[06:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
[06:26:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm trying to write an include for the initSelector option.
[06:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if we have an example of this in UI.
[06:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure you can do what you want.
[06:27:50] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, it's <option name="initSelector" default=":jqmData(role='<placeholder name="name"> if the <entry> has no init-selector attribute and otherwise it's the entry's init-selector attribute">
[06:29:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, I'm trying to achieve two things: 1. Grab the init-selector attribute of the <entry> and use it as the value of the default attribute of the option. 2. Write an if statement that will generate the default value for the <option> if the <entry> does not have an init-selector attribute.
[06:29:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: 1. is more important than 2.
[06:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I think you can accomplish both. It's just an odd format to write. I'm 99% sure we're doing this somewhere.
[06:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, here's what you want.
[06:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> Make an include like https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/includes/widget-event-create.xml
[06:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Leave the attribute out of the <option> node.
[06:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> Use <xsl:attribute>: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L58-L60
[06:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, hmm.....
[06:31:43] <scott_gonzalez> You probably need something that's not XSL.
[06:32:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It would be possible if <option> would accept both an attribute named "default" and a child node named <default>
[06:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we can just build this into the XSL.
[06:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> We'll just add another global option.
[06:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> For whether or not initSelector should be included.
[06:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> We'll set the variable to false in the base template.
[06:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> And you can set it to true in https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl
[06:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just like https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L4
[06:35:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, but then how do I write my include? <option name="initSelector" default=????>...</option>
[06:36:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Wait. I omit it. I remember you saying that.
[06:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> You'll just have <entry ... initSelect="...">
[06:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> And if you leave it out, it'll use the default.
[06:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> All the logic will live in the XSL.
[06:38:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[06:42:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, so lemme get this straight: If an <entry> does not have an attribute name "initSelector" one will be generated for it based on its "name" attribute and its value will be set to ":jqmData(role='<the value of the name attribute>')" and so if it has an attribute named "initSelector" and it contains an <option name="initSelector"> then it will set the attribute "default" on that <option> to the value of the <entry>'s "init
[06:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> initSelector isn't an option.
[06:44:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Not anymore, but it was, and we must document it as such, adding in bold that it's deprecated as of 1.4.0 and will be removed.
[06:44:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That same bold text must also say that it moves to the prototype.
[06:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> That needs to be done outside of the XSL.
[06:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> The XSL is for what's new.
[06:45:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, there's no point in modifying it for something that will be gone anyway.
[06:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually not sure how you want to document the initSelector.
[06:45:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and once it moves into the prototype, we can just add a blurb about it and use <placeholder name="initSelector" /> inside that blurb.
[06:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's already inside the prototype.
[06:46:04] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, but so far it was inside .prototype.options
[06:46:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So it had to be documented via an <option>
[06:47:36] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I have this: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/6450326
[06:47:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: This should be sufficient for 1.4.0.
[06:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> It needs to be marked deprecated.
[06:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> Like for real marked deprecated, not just in text.
[06:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> I also don't think this will work. Have you tried it?
[06:49:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We have a way of marking things as deprecated?
[06:49:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yes. I have included it in various files.
[06:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> Huh. Interesting.
[06:49:46] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I wish I could give you a URL, but unfortunately the server is very strict about checking the hostname.
[06:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, again, I think I'm getting confused by the difference between XML and XSL.
[06:49:55] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and the port.
[06:50:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: This include is modelled after, like, includes/widget-option-disabled.xml
[06:50:38] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Except it uses two placeholders: name, and init-selector.
[06:50:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: disabled only uses one: name.
[06:51:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It would've been nice for the value to end up in the attribute named "default", but a <p> at the top of the <desc> will work just fine.
[06:51:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... especially since it's just for this version.
[06:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> You can use added="..." and deprecated="..." on pretty much anything.
[06:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> Where the value is a version number.
[06:53:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, cool!
[06:53:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Awesome!
[06:53:25] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Will do!
[06:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> We really need documentation on what the XML supports.
[06:54:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: This is starting to smell like an infinite recursion :)
[06:54:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We need to root this recursion in plain text.
[06:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a good way to document an XML API?
[06:55:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: A DTD?
[06:55:26] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, I said a good way :-P
[06:55:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... with lots of comments.
[06:56:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Markdown?
[06:56:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think this is an awesome ref: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
[06:57:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: All on one page, no frills.
[06:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, a large freeform markdown file with code blocks is probably the best.
[06:58:28] <_|Nix|_> +1
[07:14:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just realized something: An undismissible popup can work as a loader.
[07:14:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that's a good idea
[07:15:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is already a feature request for prevent interactions with the page while loading
[07:15:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The only thing is that the popup shuns page changes, so it might have to be modified not to react to those.
[07:15:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Might want to factor that out. I'll file a bug.
[07:15:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Popup is gonna have sooo many extensions :)
[07:17:36] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6442: Factor decision-to-close into an extension  02http://git.io/m82V9Q
[07:17:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: i think before we put too too much work into popup we should look into ui dialog
[07:18:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: its essentially a complete duplication of popup just without history
[07:18:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... makes sense.
[07:18:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1
[07:18:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: My thinking is that, after I've split popup into a pile of extensions, the base widget will essentially be the ui dialog.
[07:18:59] <arschmitz> and i want to factor history out of widgets into a "back button extension" anyway 
[07:19:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed. Me too.
[07:19:10] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:19:16] <uGoMobi> we need it for panels too
[07:19:21] <arschmitz> yup
[07:20:04] <_|Nix|_> Man, we need to proceed judiciously after 1.4.0. Implement some of all this and then release again.
[07:20:14] <uGoMobi> and if we implement things like datepicker we probably also want to make it possible to close it with back button
[07:20:32] <arschmitz> yeah backbutton needs to be completely factored out
[07:20:43] <arschmitz> for widgets
[07:20:53] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:20:59] <arschmitz> so it can be added to whatever needs it
[07:21:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed. In fact, I can invision an optoin for the back button as to whether it navigates deep-linkably or not.
[07:21:20] <_|Nix|_> e/inv/env/
[07:21:32] <_|Nix|_> I can't type. Sorry!
[07:21:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah the whole navigation api needs a good review
[07:21:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think thats going to be my personal project for 1.5 unless something more important comes up
[07:24:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the most important thing for 1.5.0 is to 1. get rid of all the stuff we've deprecated, and 2. release it quickly, even if the additional functionality is not that much.
[07:25:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we should try to break up the nav work such that we can release only a portion of it in 1.5.0, but make 1.5.0 a quicker followup to 1.4.0 than it would be if we were to release the whole review.
[07:25:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's OK to span multiple minor versions as long as the real time spent is not too much longer.
[07:26:03] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: ... and it'll force us to prioritize.
[07:26:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[07:26:25] <_|Nix|_> RWhitbeck: Sorry!
[07:26:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im tossed on that
[07:27:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and there's that whole don't-emit-native-events thing looming ever larger :)
[07:27:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because i think people dislike too quick of a release cycle as much as too long of one
[07:28:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I say these things because we tend to take on too much and end up on the long-release-cycle end of the scale.
[07:28:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, the nav review will be much more targeted than the widget review. The widget review was a lot of small, repeated, important things.
[07:29:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Unlike that, there's only one nav.
[07:29:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So we might actually get a lot in in a reasonable amount of time.
[07:29:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i understand 
[07:30:09] <arschmitz> and also scott_gonzalez and i have already started on nav a bit
[07:30:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: All the better!
[07:30:21] <arschmitz> and i think his help will help things move pretty quickly
[07:30:30] <_|Nix|_> Great!
[07:33:01] <arschmitz> yup and if im working mostly on nav then you can concentrate on widget stuff and finish review
[07:33:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the native events i think we should hold off until 1.6 at least dont want to make massive changes 2 versions in a row
[07:33:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's only one place where our paths will cross: The popup navigate extension.
[07:34:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[07:34:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or rather the generic navigate extension.
[07:34:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not that we cant help out on other stuff just gives us each a general area to concentrate on 
[07:35:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[08:13:37] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: wanted to ask if you needed input about Mobile for Austin talk
[08:13:58] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: arschmitz just told me you two already looked into key changes for 1.4
[08:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Yeah, I've been talking with arschmitz about it.
[08:14:17] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: let me know if you need anything else
[08:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> Will do. Thanks.
[08:14:40] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: we will make sure 1.4 beta is out before you are on stage :)
[08:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know for sure which version of iOS added Touch Events?
[08:49:13] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: If you're feeling generous, you can debug Kendo + jQuery UI for this guy :-P http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9535
[08:53:59] <tj_vantoll> Uhhh… no :)
[09:23:42] <_|Nix|_> Oh no! I forgot to include js/widgets/popup.arrow.js in js/jquery.mobile.js ...
[09:24:05] <_|Nix|_> So it's in neither alpha ...
[09:24:46] <_|Nix|_> I just realized it when I was trying to write a resources/popup/example12.html for the API doc page.
[09:25:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how about slider tooltip?
[09:26:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Argh! That one's missing too ...
[09:26:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Dang nab it with our two include files ...
[09:27:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I included it in index.php but not jquery.mobile.js ...
[09:27:31] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, it might've been a merge error.
[09:27:36] <_|Nix|_> Lemme see ...
[09:30:24] <_|Nix|_> Nope. It was me. I forgot both.
[09:30:49] <_|Nix|_> At least I can't see anything in the git log.
[09:32:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, this is kinda awkward, but can I still add them?
[09:33:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes

[09:39:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how come your popup arrow size demo is working?
[09:39:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does that load the custom script/css you added for 1.3 demos?
[09:42:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The demo should no longer be in the examples.
[09:42:51] <uGoMobi> it's an awesome demo BTW
[09:42:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did I not remove it?
[09:43:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It should only be in widgets/popup/ now.
[09:43:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you added the one to show custom size
[09:43:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[09:43:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the demos work because they use the index.php, not the jquery.mobile.js
[09:44:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: they do
[09:44:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so that's why they work.
[09:44:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thought you said it wasn't in there either
[09:44:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, misunderstood
[09:44:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. The demos were fine. The build was not.
[09:45:05] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[09:45:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I only noticed it because the iframes in the API docs refer to http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.0-alpha.2 
[09:45:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would be nice indeed if we just have to update one file with all source files
[09:46:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm pndering that right now.
[09:46:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess the index.php could parse jquery.mobile.js ...
[09:46:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeeeees ... of course ...
[09:46:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It could open it as a local file.
[09:46:42] <_|Nix|_> I am so trying that.
[09:47:28] <gseguin> why don't the demo use AMD ?
[09:47:55] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Good question.
[09:48:12] <gseguin> I'm not talking about the template inclusions via php that we resolve at build time
[09:48:38] <gseguin> I think it would be a good example too for people who what to use our AMD module
[09:49:09] <gseguin> should we create a dev task for that?
[09:49:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well, actually, that's an excellent point. We should have a demo illustrating the requirejs setup for individual modules.
[09:49:27] <uGoMobi> I just updated that backbone requirejs demo in an ugly way
[09:49:46] <uGoMobi> it used its own copy of JQM which we needed to update with every release
[09:49:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: However, we must keep in mind that we should avoid a situation where requirejs is causing requests to a remote server.
[09:50:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I know I've noticed that
[09:50:05] <uGoMobi> couldn't point to index.php
[09:50:09] <gseguin> it should use the cdn version
[09:50:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, whenever that would happen, we must still render to a single file.
[09:50:34] <uGoMobi> so i know have a js file that uses $.getScript() to get that JS from that index.php :/
[09:51:03] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'll look at your change
[09:51:06] <gseguin> is it pushed?
[09:51:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no, and it's in a branhc
[09:51:19] <uGoMobi> branch
[09:51:32] <gseguin> ok, I'll try to take a look at it tonight
[09:51:35] <uGoMobi> doing all demo updates in just a few commits
[09:51:46] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, for now I think I'll unify the index.php and the jquery.mobile.js ...
[09:51:46] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[09:55:38] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#770 (master - 5f151d7 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build passed.
[09:55:38] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/561a024aa029...5f151d717e5f
[09:55:38] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/11023822
[09:57:33] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec ... I can't unify the two files, unless we specify that the order in which the deps in jquery.mobile.js are listed matters.
[09:58:02] <_|Nix|_> ... because currently it doesn't matter, because requirejs establishes the order, but in the php order matters, because nobody establishes order.
[09:58:57] <_|Nix|_> In fact jquery.mobile.ns isn't even listed in jquery.mobile.js, but, of course, it gets pulled because other files depend on it.
[10:13:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: How come [this](https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/6453176) results in an empty dist/jquery.mobile.js?
[10:13:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: All I did was move the inline array declaration to a var.
[10:14:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I change the file like that, run grunt, and the result is an empty dist/jquery.mobile.js - well, aside from the wrapper.start + wrapper.end ...
[10:15:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I wanna change it like that to make it easier to parse from PHP.

[10:17:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[10:18:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, I think I got it.
[10:19:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you got a chance to test this on Lumia 920 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349 ?
[10:19:19] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6349 by uGoMobi (2w 6d ago): Panel: Page contents disappear when opening a panel on WP8
[10:29:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, this is weird. We have require( [ "./jquery.mobile.init" ], function() {} ); right?
[10:29:54] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: If I change [ "./jquery.mobile.init" ] to startFileArray, and precede the require() call with var startFileArray = [ "./jquery.mobile.init" ]; it no longer works.
[10:30:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It's like it has to be require( <inline declaration>, function() {} ); or else it won't work.
[10:42:15] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: did you solve your issue?
[10:42:21] <gseguin> back now
[10:43:42] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it's probably because the way requirejs parses the file
[10:44:21] <gseguin> it must be looking for an array maybe using a RegExp
[10:47:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's what I figured :(
[10:47:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It's not getting interpreted at all.
[10:47:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: is that the jquery.mobile.js ?
[10:48:46] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: we need to put only top-level components in it and let the dependencies get resolved I think it would be much clearer this way
[11:01:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, but that precludes parsing it from the PHP.

[11:02:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM.
[11:02:29] <uGoMobi> arghh
[11:02:31] <uGoMobi> one sec
[11:30:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349  the test page is 404
[11:30:21] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6349 by uGoMobi (2w 6d ago): Panel: Page contents disappear when opening a panel on WP8
[11:30:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, sorry I moved that one... will post new link
[11:53:33] <arschmitz> things go much quicker with a lot less people lol
[11:53:44] <uGoMobi> yeah that's a benefit ;)
[11:53:46] <arschmitz> and not all doing individual updates
[11:54:16] <arschmitz> as much as i loved a good 2 hour meeting lol
[11:54:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you have to learn me what is the easiest way to merge a PR without the merge commit
[11:54:30] <uGoMobi> I can pull it in a branch
[11:54:37] <uGoMobi> and then just rebase master?
[11:54:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there are basicly 2 ways
[11:54:42] <_|Nix|_> I don't feel very strongly about autogrow. I'm cool with the way it is now. I'll BBL.
[11:54:52] <arschmitz> you can do it with a rebase
[11:54:58] <arschmitz> or you can cherry pick it
[11:55:01] <uGoMobi> later _|Nix|_ 
[11:55:26] <arschmitz> if its several commits i think its easier to rebase but if its only one i like to cherry-pick
[11:55:40] <arschmitz> but thats purely my prefrence
[11:55:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:56:03] <uGoMobi> I thought it was bad to rebase something that was not local
[11:56:46] <uGoMobi> do I first pull in a branch and then just $ git rebase master ?
[11:57:17] <arschmitz> so for that one i would git checkout -b pereorga-optimize-images master; git pull https://github.com/pereorga/jquery-mobile.git optimize-images; git checkout master; git cherry-pick 8b8a5ca4c2aa2064de7d1bbe93920093e551842d
[11:57:38] <uGoMobi> right
[11:57:47] <uGoMobi> didn't think about cherry-picking
[11:58:47] <uGoMobi> wish I asked before I green button'ed that readme.md PR for moving rebasing info ;-)
[11:59:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks
[11:59:20] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah i saw that one :)
[11:59:40] <uGoMobi> yeah, I have to admit it was kinda dumb of me
[12:00:16] <arschmitz> and considering corey has almost 0 involvment with mobile what are the chances of him seeing it lol
[12:39:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I updated the link to the panel test page for that WP8 issue http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/page-a.html
[12:43:04] <arschmitz> ok ill check it out
[12:47:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes it happens on 920
[12:47:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks for testing
[12:47:51] <arschmitz> no problem
[17:01:34] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding spinner and invalid values: How do you force a valid value on blur?
[17:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> elem.spinner( "value", elem.val() ) should work.
