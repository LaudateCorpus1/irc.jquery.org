[05:39:34] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/smallerWidths] Make Download Builder and ThemeRoller widths adjustable to smaller widths - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[05:54:54] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, still in smallerWidths fix, I had some hard time making fieldset to behave like table-row. So, I've replaced it for a div. Now, DownloadBuilder and ThemeRoller layouts in small widths on the deployed page seems just fine! https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/compare/smallerWidths
[05:56:28] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: okay!
[05:56:55] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, I shall lend it then, right
[05:57:16] <rxaviers> I was wondering if the semantics of losing the fieldset is something we dont want somehow
[05:58:34] <rxaviers> But, now, the widths are relative, tabbed. I think the presentation is smoother in all widhts
[05:58:40] <rxaviers> widths*
[05:59:51] <rxaviers> I will show what Im talking about in a pic
[06:08:39] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: is all good, there's no semantic markup fanatics here :-)
[06:08:54] <rxaviers> ahhah ok
[06:13:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, the before vs. after's: http://rxaviers.minus.com/mpyume0qc
[06:17:48] <jzaefferer> nice
[06:18:02] <rxaviers> ok will lend then

[06:20:35] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, is stage working for you?
[06:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> WHERE'S MY SEMANTIC WEB?!?
[06:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin1: Is there a way to find out the root of the site?
[06:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> Resources are currently tied to HTTP_HOST, so I'll need to change that.
[06:48:01] <jzaefferer> stage is down for me, too
[06:49:48] <jzaefferer> so download builder still works, but http://stage.jqueryui.com/ is down
[06:52:36] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez nacin1 gnarf: any idea what's up with jq01/stage.jqueryui.com?
[06:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[06:58:55] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe it broke with the subdirectory sites update?
[07:06:56] <jzaefferer> That seems likely
[07:07:02] <jzaefferer> I don't know what log to check
[07:07:07] <jzaefferer> syslog is not conclusive
[07:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> wow, I suck
[07:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/3d9f6b5bc74d09a08f6a116b6b31d93d72971f6d
[07:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> I completely changed an API and just referenced  a bug ticket.
[07:41:27] <jzaefferer> (party)
[07:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> It must've been a Thursday. I remember doing this in Panera.
[07:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that was 7 months ago.
[07:43:11] <kborchers> :/
[07:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> And I was right, it was a Thursday :-P
[07:43:16] <kborchers> heh
[07:44:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: pretty sure IE6 was good in my testing … anything animated was hard to tell though since ie6 on browserstack is _SUPER_ slow and _SUPER_ choppy
[07:44:41] <kborchers> speaking of browserstack … did you do your talk already?
[07:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> I did
[07:45:01] <kborchers> go well? good crowd?
[07:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> It went well. The room was full :-)
[07:45:05] <kborchers> heh
[07:45:06] <kborchers> nice

[07:45:18] <jquicommit> [download.jqueryui.com/master] Cache theme gallery image files - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[07:45:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so you're driving up to chicago now right? :P
[07:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> I started the presentation talking about NN vs. IE.
[07:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> I asked how many people were at least playing with HTML back then, the ENTIRE ROOM raised their hands.
[07:46:25] <kborchers> wow
[07:47:22] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, i had an idea for 12 more datepicker options since there aren't that many :P
[07:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> Worst wifi ever.
[07:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> Not at the conf, in the hotel.
[07:48:48] <kborchers> oh, yeah that's probably to be expected since i'm sure everyone in the hotel is attending the conf which means they are all wifi hogs
[07:49:37] <kborchers> and i'm sure everyone is testing their stuff via browserstack now that they saw your talk so that'll eat some bandwidth :D
[07:50:16] <johnwards> *cough* No jQuery UI proposals for jQuery UK yet. https://jqueryuk2013.busyconf.com/proposals/new
[07:51:07] <johnwards> I can't vouch for hotel wifi. But the large installation I'm having to do for the conference wifi should hopefully means it sort of works
[07:51:49] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, now theme gallery image files are cached! :) much better here (where the fetches is via internet). Reduced from 4s to 1s the package build time
[07:52:03] <rxaviers> are* via internet
[07:52:17] <kborchers> johnwards: been thinking about it actually but haven't put anything together yet
[07:52:36] <johnwards> 11th of October deadline. So a wee while yet
[07:52:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, congrats for the presentation
[07:55:53] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: looking good!
[07:56:00] <rxaviers> cool :D
[07:57:14] <rxaviers> lunch time, brb
[07:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefullly the wifi cooperates during the meeting.
[08:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna grab some lunch before the meeting. Hopefully I can reconnect afterward :-P
[08:28:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: prepared the agenda

[10:24:58] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez - missed the meeting, but managed to fix the bug nacin introduced in web-base-template, pushing my fix now
[10:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:26:17] <nacin> I think the themes (header.php) needed a change or two
[10:26:19] <nacin> anything else?
[10:26:27] <nacin> I saw that resources were borked.
[10:26:35] <nacin> which will need new rewrites
[10:27:11] <nacin> the root of a site would be home_url(), then chopping off 'https://'
[10:27:20] <nacin> or JQUERY_STAGING_PREFIX . JQUERY_LIVE_SITE
[10:28:34] <jzaefferer> nacin: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/f78a6a29397fe869180358d4d56f1c7419a1fc2f#commitcomment-1909319
[10:29:34] <nacin> jzaefferer: indeed
[10:29:41] <nacin> was trying to do s/domain/site/g
[10:30:12] <jzaefferer> I just wonder how you missed that - it broke dev.jqueryui.com locally for me, as well as stage.jqueryui.com
[10:30:30] <jzaefferer> maybe it only broke sites that didn't have specific plugins?
[10:30:33] <nacin> it was 5am and I was only testing I was testing on api.jqueryui.com
[10:30:34] <nacin> correct
[10:30:41] <jzaefferer> err, only sites that had specific ones
[10:30:44] <nacin> sorry!
[10:30:52] <nacin> you should see what I do to wordpress.org ;-)
[10:30:57] <jzaefferer> haha
[10:31:13] <jzaefferer> well, its back to working now, didn't take that long to track down :-)
[10:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: home_url() is standard WordPress API?
[10:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to keep grunt-wordpress working outside of jQuery sites.
[10:34:38] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes it is
[10:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[10:40:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: "Update release script to generate themes" <- done
[10:40:13] <jzaefferer> "Clean up version info for sites, deployment tools, etc." <- what does that mean?
[10:40:32] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I've got a VM with IE6 - is there something specific worth checking?
[10:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The release script hasn't been updated. You're thinking of grunt.
[10:41:19] <jzaefferer> oh, right
[10:41:29] <jzaefferer> well, that's something ;)
[10:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just waiting until I'm on a good network connection before I make that update.
[10:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> Since testing it requires cloning the jquery-ui repo for every test.
[10:41:55] <kborchers> jzaefferer: not in particular … if you want to just grab some visual tests or demos that you know have animation and make sure they look right that would probably be good.  just hard to tell on browserstack as sometimes things just went from one state to the other with no animation but it just may have been display lag
[10:42:09] <jzaefferer> so just replace "grunt release" with "grunt release_themes"?
[10:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Cleaning up version info is things like making sure that jqueryui.com will have 1.9.0 on it, making sure download builder will generate 1.9.0 downloads, etc.
[10:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> We have version info in various places across multiple repos.
[10:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> And they're not tied together.
[10:43:25] <jzaefferer> So we need to release 1.9.0 first, before updating that?
[10:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> For most (all?) places, yes.
[10:43:49] <jzaefferer> Unless we're okay with 404s, until upload to code.jquery.com is done
[10:43:58] <jzaefferer> on staging anyway
[10:44:13] <jzaefferer> might as well do that now
[10:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> If we update things now, then we're saying that nothing can be tested anymore.
[10:45:02] <jzaefferer> I don't understand
[10:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> If we update the sites to point at 1.9.0 for everything, then nothing will work.
[10:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> Which means no more testing of demos, download builder, ThemeRoller, etc.
[10:46:00] <jzaefferer> ah, right, download builder is on 1.9.0pre...
[10:46:23] <jzaefferer> I'll publish a new downloadbuilder to npm now to get that updated on stage
[10:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[10:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> He even created toggle switches using sliders.
[10:51:12] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yep, its pretty nice, but has some holes: https://github.com/kiandra/Delta-jQuery-UI-Theme/issues/2
[10:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, nice descriptive summary :-P
[10:56:06] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, that theme is nice but that close button looks rediculous

[10:58:22] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, caching images in lib/builder initialization makes its unit test take longer. I will change Builder class, so we can call Builder.cacheThemeImages explicitly in the server, ok?
[10:58:34] <rxaviers> to* take
[10:59:33] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: sounds good
[10:59:43] <rxaviers> excelent ;)
[11:01:59] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: now the advanced section is looking properly: http://stage.jqueryui.com/download/
[11:02:27] <rxaviers> ;)
[11:04:55] <rxaviers> gnarf, mr. Could I get access to stage machine?
[11:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, why did we do that on the old site?
[11:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> Modal dialogs in place of tooltips? WHAT WERE WE THINKING?
[11:05:27] <jzaefferer> Too much content for a tooltip?
[11:05:30] <jzaefferer> Or just silly?
[11:05:53] <jzaefferer> Should just use .tooltip() with the content option to provide formatted markup...
[11:05:57] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: ^^^
[11:06:03] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: meh https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/324

[11:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: replied to that ticket.
[11:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'd vote for closing it.

[11:14:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: there's a bunch of somewhat obscure links below the demo links: http://bassistance.de/i/384e70.png - anything there we need to restore?
[11:15:03] <jzaefferer> working through QUnit issues now, but since DB/TR are 99.9999% done, rxaviers and me are available...
[11:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so (at least not right now)
[11:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> We link to the important stuff on the home page or the development page now.
[11:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> Most people won't be intersted in the other stuff.
[11:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> We'll eventually want good theming info, but based on the lack of custom themes in the past few years, I highly doubt our current docs are providing much value.
[11:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You could always start on ticket triage or reviewing menubar and selectmenu.
[11:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, here's something: .ui-front :-)
