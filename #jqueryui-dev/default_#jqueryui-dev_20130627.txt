[05:07:02] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[05:07:11] <uGoMobi> hey frequent
[05:07:50] <frequent> did you have time to look at the filter widget I did ?
[05:08:17] <frequent> http://bit.ly/139Kl50
[05:08:28] <uGoMobi> frequent: no, got back from vacation yesterday
[05:08:35] <frequent> ok
[05:09:25] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks!
[05:09:29] <frequent> I want to add some tests on the weekend
[05:09:35] <uGoMobi> frequent: I will look into it today or tomorrow
[05:09:56] <frequent> just need to know if there should be tests for all possible elements that could be filtered
[05:10:05] <frequent> you can let me know when you have time
[05:15:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok, will do
[05:15:39] <frequent> cool. thanks
[05:38:09] <arschmitz> frequent: you still around?
[05:38:47] <frequent> yes
[05:39:05] <frequent> arschmitz: yes
[05:39:35] <arschmitz> frequent: i saw your filter widget and i was a little confused
[05:40:21] <arschmitz> do you plan on maintaining this in your own repo or do you intend to do a pr. i ask because i noticed you made a repo for just this and not a fork of jqm?
[05:41:26] <frequent> I wanted to commit to JQM. Just did a clean repo until it's working, then I will do a PR
[05:41:35] <arschmitz> frequent: ok
[05:41:50] <frequent> I'm still sitting over that one test and will wait for uGoMobi to inform me what other tests I should do
[05:42:09] <arschmitz> frequent: as far as tests you should test all possible elements it can filter
[05:42:17] <frequent> ok
[05:42:20] <arschmitz> otherwise you dont truely know it works correctly on all of them
[05:42:50] <uGoMobi> +1
[05:42:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[05:43:04] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:44:05] <frequent> arschmitz: could you tell me on the existing listview.filter test (http://bit.ly/17EPkgO)
[05:44:47] <arschmitz> frequent: tell you what?
[05:44:48] <frequent> how refreshCornersCount ever reaches 3 when the filter input is only changed 2 times. That test I cannot get to work = I'm stuck at 2, all test parameters passing
[05:44:57] <arschmitz> oops sorry impatient i guess :)
[05:45:02] <frequent> np
[05:56:42] <arschmitz> frequent: disclaimer this is the first time i think iv actually looked at the listview filter tests
[05:56:55] <frequent> :-)
[06:06:53] <arschmitz> frequent: its because it gets called once on create
[06:07:09] <arschmitz> once on first value change
[06:07:14] <arschmitz> and once on second
[06:08:14] <frequent> arschmitz: I see. So I guess I'm missing the create call. Good! Thanks for chipping in. Will try to fix on the weekend along with the remainder of the tests.
[06:08:15] <arschmitz> frequent: because its in refresh
[06:11:50] <arschmitz> frequent: ill review the widget today
[06:14:30] <arschmitz> frequent: one thing i see right off is that the whole thing is only one method.
[06:14:59] <arschmitz> frequent: nevermind the indenting was messed up my bad
[06:21:31] <frequent> arschmitz: np (back from not finding any coffee...)
[06:21:41] <arschmitz> sad day.....
[06:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> Why have I never thought of this before?
[06:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> input:not([type])
[06:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, no old IE support.
[06:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> bah
[06:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, I've held out this long, I can hold out until IE8 dies off. I shall continue to use <input> without a type for text fields...
[06:31:51] <tj_vantoll> Yep.
[07:00:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[07:00:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yep
[07:01:16] <arschmitz> im sharing the doc right now you asked for
[07:01:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[07:01:39] <arschmitz> and id say that list of devices is pretty good thats what i found when i looked up market shares last week pretty much
[07:01:50] <arschmitz> i also do not have a 4.0 4.1 or 4.2 phone
[07:01:54] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[07:02:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill start looking for the rest of that last i was already looking for a s3 but have been trying to keep it under 200 but no luck so far think im going to have to break and pay more 
[07:03:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i had asked gabrial before what he needed and he didnt tell me any :| but now that i know ill get right on top of it
[07:04:03] <arschmitz> if its ok ill hold of a bit on sending the iphone so i can combine with androids to save shipping to you
[07:04:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what about tablets ? do you need / want any android tablets?
[07:04:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think the S3 is especially useful for you and Gabriel because I often see perfomance issues
[07:04:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree
[07:05:01] <uGoMobi> yeah, better ship all at once
[07:05:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i like to save as much as possible on this stuff to stretch the budget out
[07:06:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, good plan
[07:06:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't have an Android tablet
[07:06:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so ill see about some tablets too
[07:06:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the Nexus 7 is good device to test CSS stuff like transitions
[07:06:51] <arschmitz> i see galaxy tabs and nexus 7's all the time 
[07:07:04] <arschmitz> for like $150
[07:07:10] <arschmitz> so thats a good cheap get
[07:07:11] <uGoMobi> but it's running 4.2 and I already have a 4.2 Galaxy Nexus phone
[07:07:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so maybe a tab2 for you?
[07:07:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thing is even on same version the tablet and phones ahave different issues too
[07:08:11] <uGoMobi> is the tab 2 running 4.2?
[07:08:17] <arschmitz> i dont think so
[07:08:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's true (different issues)
[07:08:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also you can find them not upgraded sometimes too
[07:09:03] <uGoMobi> a new Nexus 7 is about 185 euro here (8Gb version)
[07:09:17] <uGoMobi> haven't looked at used ones
[07:10:51] <arschmitz> yeah uGoMobii can get one for $111 euro
[07:10:51] <arschmitz> right now
[07:10:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't get the link to that doc in Google Drive
[07:11:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds like good deal
[07:11:54] <uGoMobi> but maybe we should first look at complete picture... all devices that are needed for you and Gabriel as well
[07:12:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, got the link now
[07:12:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok

[09:16:49] <jzaefferer> gseguin: what's tech-angels?
[09:28:13] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I send you an invite for Gemnasium
[09:28:24] <gseguin> it monitors project's dependencies on gihub
[09:28:47] <gseguin> and tell you which projects are not using the latest version of their dependencies
[09:29:22] <gseguin> I registered the jquery "company" and gave a few of you owner access
[09:29:27] <gseguin> we don't have to use it
[09:29:34] <gseguin> I just wanted to check it out
[09:29:57] <jzaefferer> gseguin: sounds interesting. The email just didn't have any information in it
[09:30:31] <gseguin> jzaefferer: yeah, check it out: https://gemnasium.com/jquery
[09:32:09] <jzaefferer> gseguin: this is weird. I clicked the link in the email, then it asked me to sign-up. But I can't sign up, since the email is already taken. I can't reset my password, since my account is not activated
[09:32:43] <gseguin> jzaefferer: can you just sign in with your github account?
[09:33:04] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:33:16] <gseguin> hmm.. weird
[09:33:29] <gseguin> we discovered a bug
[09:33:39] <jzaefferer> the confirmation is broken
[09:34:01] <gseguin> let me remove you to see if that will change something
[09:35:19] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I removed you
[09:35:25] <gseguin> jzaefferer: try again ?
[09:35:44] <gseguin> jzaefferer: do you have a jquery.org address?
[09:36:18] <jzaefferer> gseguin: yeah, joern@jquery.com should work
[09:36:40] <gseguin> I've whitelisted jquery.org and jquery.com
[09:38:13] <gseguin> johnbender: I need help to understand something with the navigation thing
[09:38:23] <gseguin> johnbender: do you have 20 min?
[09:39:06] <gseguin> jzaefferer: is it working?
[09:39:48] <jzaefferer> gseguin: I'm signed in now
[09:43:22] <gseguin> with which address ?
[09:43:36] <gseguin> oh I got it
[09:43:53] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I made you an owner
[09:51:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: hi there, we're online if you want to chat

[11:05:48] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I unmoderated the room
[11:05:56] <gseguin> but I'm not going to attend

[11:07:37] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks, I dunno much about IRC ;)
[11:47:04] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, have a sec to talk about the docs category thing? If we need to add an entry/page into a category, what do we need to do? Create the entry/page xml on api.jqueryui.com and make sure the xml has an appropriate <category> tag in there saying what categs it belongs to?
[11:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yes, just look at any existing entry, they all have categories.
[11:51:12] <rxaviers> Who is responsible for listing the index of entries/pages of a category (when we browse api), I guess this is done by wordpress then?
[11:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[11:57:49] <rxaviers> thks
[12:25:01] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__ toddmparker scott_gonzalez: have time to continue grunticon discussion?
[12:26:49] <scottjehl__> sure
[12:27:52] <scottjehl__> so I guess you could make an html page with a grids of all the svg icons and render it out to a png in phantom.js, as part of our build
[12:28:30] <scottjehl__> ...to try the fallback idea. one request really would be ideal
[12:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like its worth looking into.
[12:31:45] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: can you mute -meeting?
[12:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:31:56] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:32:51] <scottjehl__> there was a PR to generate a sprite fallback. worth looking at
[12:33:02] <scottjehl__> in the grunticon repo
[12:34:03] <scottjehl__> hmm maybe not
[12:34:06] <scottjehl__> but anyway
[12:34:12] <scottjehl__> worth looking into I agree
[12:37:39] <gseguin> arschmitz: ping
[12:37:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: hi
[12:38:16] <gseguin> hey, I was working on migrating Jive Mobile to jqm 1.3.1
[12:38:31] <arschmitz> ok
[12:38:41] <gseguin> and discovered a possible issue with links pointing at internal page but with a querystring in the hash
[12:39:08] <gseguin> because the click hijacking code uses changePage, the querystring in the hash gets dropped
[12:39:22] <arschmitz> we dont support query strings in the hash
[12:39:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: that conversation is for you too
[12:39:46] <gseguin> arschmitz: jqm doesn't but that is not a reason for discarding it
[12:39:52] <gseguin> that's how we keep state
[12:40:01] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__ scott_gonzalez : okay, let's see if we can make that work
[12:40:01] <gseguin> so you can deeplink into a page
[12:40:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: i totally agree it should be possible but its been documented for a long time its not
[12:40:42] <gseguin> we basically have a set of pages where the content is loaded via xhr and we use the pseudo querystring to pass the api path to load
[12:41:05] <gseguin> arschmitz: so the thing is it was working in 1.2.x
[12:41:34] <gseguin> and all it would take in 1.3.x+ would be to change the call to changePage in the click handler to a call to .navigate
[12:41:42] <gseguin> I chatted with Bender about it
[12:41:46] <arschmitz> hmmm i didnt realize it was ever supported the thing that strips the query is quite old
[12:41:50] <gseguin> he seems ok with that change
[12:42:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: give me 2 second i think i know the change you want and it was already planned
[12:42:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: no it was introduced in 1.3
[12:42:21] <arschmitz> do you have a link to the cause?
[12:42:32] <gseguin> no 
[12:42:59] <gseguin> but if you go there: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/widgets/pages/multipage-template.html
[12:43:22] <gseguin> and you type $.mobile.changePage( "#two?foo=bar" )
[12:43:26] <gseguin> versus
[12:43:41] <gseguin> $.mobile.navigate( "#two?foo=bar" )
[12:43:48] <gseguin> you'll see what I'm talking about
[12:45:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: if i do $.mobile.changePage( "#two?foo=bar" ) in 1.2 it throws an error
[12:46:15] <gseguin> oh, that's right we had a special handler for that
[12:46:23] <gseguin> we as in Jive
[12:46:35] <gseguin> which we don't need with 1.3.1 anymore
[12:46:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: so it didnt really work in 1.2 then?
[12:47:01] <arschmitz> with out a custom handler
[12:47:05] <gseguin> true
[12:47:11] <gseguin> but that's not the point
[12:47:26] <gseguin> hold on, I'm trying to find where the click handler is
[12:48:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: this is what i believe removes it
[12:48:31] <arschmitz> i ran into this when makeing deeplinking work in docs
[12:48:36] <gseguin> where is that damn click handler?
[12:48:48] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1200
[12:49:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: is that what your thinking of?
[12:49:47] <gseguin> yes!
[12:49:50] <gseguin> thank you 
[12:49:52] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1255
[12:50:03] <gseguin> that should be changed to .navigate
[12:50:18] <gseguin> but you can't pass a jquery object (link)
[12:50:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: have you tried this?
[12:51:09] <gseguin> I just did
[12:51:22] <arschmitz> you tried changing that line to navigate and it works?
[12:51:27] <gseguin> because right now if I have an anchor that has href="#foo?bar" we shouldn't strip the querystring part
[12:51:31] <gseguin> yep
[12:51:36] <arschmitz> hmmm ok
[12:52:07] <arschmitz> i thought it was already stripped by that point but its been a few months since i looked at this lol
[12:52:42] <arschmitz> anyway if thats the whole change im totally fine with it
[12:53:17] <arschmitz> espically if johnbender already signed off on it
[12:53:38] <gseguin> I want to run this by _|Nix|_ too
[12:53:59] <gseguin> johnbender mentioned something about putting that in both master and content widget branches
[12:54:14] <arschmitz> if you in there making the change though you should pull the line 5 up from that that says remove before 1.0 lol
[12:54:32] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:54:41] <gseguin> also, should we backport to 1.3-stable ?
[12:54:42] <arschmitz> and yes id do in both of the branches
[12:54:58] <arschmitz> hmmmm 
[12:55:11] <gseguin> johnbender wasn't too hot on that
[12:55:18] <gseguin> but I feel like this is a bug
[12:55:21] <arschmitz> its not really a bug because it jut was not supported before
[12:55:34] <gseguin> agreed but we're not consistent either
[12:55:51] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah but its actually in the docs that its not supported
[12:56:00] <gseguin> in 1.2 if your anchor contains a "?" the changePage doesn't work but the location changes
[12:56:02] <arschmitz> and in 1.2 it actually threw an error if you tried
[12:56:12] <gseguin> yeah yeah
[12:56:30] <gseguin> in 1.3 it changes page but loses the querystring
[12:56:52] <arschmitz> gseguin: to be clear id like to have it in 1.3 stable but semvar disagrees with me lol 
[12:57:16] <gseguin> so... I think it would be fine to change page and honor the link url
[12:57:42] <gseguin> that's arguable 
[12:58:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i dont know id have to say i agree with john on this one that im not crazy about putting on 1.3 stable but id check with uGoMobi and _|Nix|_ see what they think
[12:59:06] <gseguin> k
[12:59:08] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: any idea how I could quickly fix this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6081 ?
[12:59:25] <gseguin> I'll do the change in master and will lobby for cherry-picking it to 1.3-stable
[12:59:39] <gseguin> I'll start making banners for my one man demonstration
[12:59:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: sounds like a plan
[12:59:56] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: give me a few minutes ill see what i can do
[13:00:03] <ryanneufeld> Thanks man
[13:00:29] <gseguin> "What do we want? .navigate in 1.3-stable!" 
[13:00:41] <gseguin> "When do we want it? NAO!"
[13:05:01] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: is this an iphone only issue
[13:05:11] <arschmitz> the jsbin in the issue works fine on my ipad
[13:05:19] <arschmitz> oh it totally is
[13:05:29] <arschmitz> its because of the scroll to hide the url bar
[13:07:07] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: thats not able to be disabled by default but we have been talking about adding it as an option or removing completely
[13:07:26] <arschmitz> as it causes a bug on ios6 with the reader feature as well
[13:09:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: arschmitz I didn't follow the whole convo but I think there is a ticket for this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&labels=Query+params&page=1&sort=created&state=open
[13:09:21] <uGoMobi> or maybe multiple tickets
[13:15:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do you remember where it is we scroll to hide the url?
[13:15:32] <arschmitz> i cant seem to find it
[13:16:26] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: it's IOS only
[13:16:37] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: yeah i know
[13:17:14] <ryanneufeld> is there any kinda work around?
[13:17:27] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: im trying to figure that out now
[13:17:39] <arschmitz> im just drawing a blank on where we hide the code that does that
[13:18:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: transition.js?
[13:18:29] <uGoMobi> ( in transition folder)
[13:20:03] <uGoMobi> hmm not sure though
[13:20:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: think i found it
[13:20:30] <uGoMobi> reminds me that we have to make that optional before alpha release
[13:20:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: where is it?
[13:20:49] <arschmitz> mostly in transitions.js
[13:20:56] <arschmitz> but its kinda hidden
[13:21:01] <arschmitz> because its not explicit
[13:21:36] <uGoMobi> yeah, I just opened the file and couldn't find it directly
[13:22:03] <arschmitz> i found where the scroll is done but now im trying to find where we set $.mobile.defaultHomeScroll
[13:23:05] <arschmitz> which is in jquery.mobile.init.js
[13:24:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its here basicly https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L142
[13:25:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[13:25:30] <arschmitz> thats going to be a hard one to override  :(
[13:26:40] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: is editing jquery.mobile.js an option for you lol?
[13:26:49] <ryanneufeld> no
[13:26:52] <ryanneufeld> not really
[13:27:03] <arschmitz> didnt think so but worth asking
[13:27:56] <ryanneufeld> apparently the html5 boilerplate guys have a fix
[13:28:02] <ryanneufeld> I mean, I could edit the jquerymobile js
[13:28:11] <ryanneufeld> I'd rather not, but I could
[13:28:26] <arschmitz> ok give me a few more minutes to see if i can come up with something better
[13:28:34] <ryanneufeld> Thanks a tonne dude
[13:28:40] <arschmitz> this is something i need to change for sure for 1.4 this is not cool
[13:28:48] <ryanneufeld> so not on.
[13:29:03] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: ???
[13:29:12] <ryanneufeld> british slang
[13:29:18] <arschmitz> oh
[13:29:25] <ryanneufeld> "So not on." Meaning 'so not cool' or so not okay
[13:29:45] <arschmitz> thats an apt discription
[13:29:54] <arschmitz> ok yeah i dont think there is a work around
[13:30:11] <arschmitz> or wait maybe
[13:30:16] <arschmitz> let me try one more thing
[13:30:35] <ryanneufeld> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14047610/hiding-address-bar-without-hiding-the-smart-app-banner-on-ios-6/14169578
[13:30:37] <ryanneufeld> not sure if that helps
[13:30:49] <ryanneufeld> but there is reference to the H5bp guys
[13:30:56] <ryanneufeld> and some of their js
[13:31:04] <paul_irish> scottjehl__ has a project for it
[13:31:52] <ryanneufeld> I found the summoning spell for paul_irish
[13:32:57] <paul_irish> https://github.com/scottjehl/Hide-Address-Bar
[13:34:07] <arschmitz> paul_irish: does that account for the ios6 app banner?
[13:34:13] <paul_irish> unclear.
[13:34:18] <paul_irish> looking at the SO answer now
[13:34:34] <paul_irish> ` MBP.BODY_SCROLL_TOP === 1 ? 0 : 1 ` lol this is terrible
[13:34:51] <paul_irish> i probably wrote that :p
[13:35:12] <arschmitz> SO seems to indicate it does but i dont see where
[13:35:37] <paul_irish> well
[13:35:44] <paul_irish> its not scrollTo(0,1)
[13:35:47] <paul_irish> it uses win.pageYOffset || doc.compatMode === 'CSS1Compat' && doc.documentElement.scrollTop || doc.body.scrollTop || 0;
[13:35:59] <paul_irish> which is certainly better
[13:36:04] <arschmitz> yes
[13:36:09] * paul_irish looks again at scotts
[13:36:58] <paul_irish> same technique, just some timeout-y shit
[13:37:00] <paul_irish> so
[13:37:08] <paul_irish> i would expect both scripts to behave the same wrt app banner
[13:37:22] <arschmitz> yup
[13:45:29] <ryanneufeld> so in theory paul_irish I should be able to include that, and it will work?
[13:45:56] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: jqm will essentially override that im pretty sure
[13:46:30] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:48:01] <scottjehl__> hey sorry
[13:48:37] <scottjehl__> kinda in the camp of not recommending that approach anymore, myself
[13:48:38] <scottjehl__> fwiw
[13:49:21] <scottjehl__> first, content heavy pages hang the address bar over the page for 8 seconds or so when you do the scrollTo thing
[13:49:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I think putting the change I just proposed would put an end to all these bugs. jqm would ignore the querystring but honor it in terms of location
[13:49:38] <scottjehl__> also, unclear but it seems like iOS7 will behave a bit differently anyway
[13:50:03] <ryanneufeld> ultimately, I need something, and iOS7 Isn't out (yet) :p
[13:50:20] <ryanneufeld> scottjehl__: your's works if I put it in mobile init it seems.
[13:50:34] <scottjehl__> is this no longer in jQM by default?
[13:50:35] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: awesome do that then!
[13:50:46] <ryanneufeld> scottjehl__: it is
[13:50:52] <ryanneufeld> but if you have an iPhone ad banner
[13:50:55] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: the one in jqm is not as fancy and it hides the ios6 app banner
[13:50:59] <ryanneufeld> then it scrolls past it
[13:51:09] <ryanneufeld> what arschmitz said ^^
[13:51:44] <scottjehl__> no idea what to do there
[13:51:46] <scottjehl__> sorry
[13:51:54] <uGoMobi> gseguin: nice! I probably missed it, but what semver rule do we break if we cherry-pick into 1.3-stable?
[13:51:57] <scottjehl__> I think the plan was to pull this out of jqm tho
[13:52:00] <scottjehl__> super jank
[13:52:42] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__: yeah, it's actually in the planning for 1.4
[13:52:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: bender and arschmitz are calling that a feature
[13:53:03] <gseguin> which would break semver
[13:53:03] <toddmparker> yeah, i've been uncomfortable with that scrolling business for a while
[13:53:07] <gseguin> I say it's a bug
[13:53:10] <toddmparker> think it messes with transitions
[13:53:28] <scottjehl__> as a user, I always wish it was not there
[13:53:37] <toddmparker> we should surface an option to turn it off at a minimum, or shut it off by default, or remove it
[13:53:40] <gseguin> uGoMobi: because 1.2.0 behaves diferently than 1.3 anyway
[13:54:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, it's probably the cause of that 1px jump issue on iOS
[13:54:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: pretty sure it is
[13:54:54] <ryanneufeld> is there any way to disable it on 1.2x?
[13:55:28] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: no
[13:55:56] <ryanneufeld> unwholesome words
[13:56:11] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: i know i know its basicly hardcoded 
[13:56:30] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L142
[13:56:34] <ryanneufeld> can it be un-hard coded?
[13:57:16] <arschmitz> you would have to basicly tear that out
[13:57:18] <ryanneufeld> if i delete that function
[13:57:26] <ryanneufeld> it would 'fix' it?
[13:57:42] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: i believe so this is "untested" though lol
[13:58:38] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:58:39] <ryanneufeld> lol
[13:59:15] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: i was trying something trickier but its not working
[13:59:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think I agree with you
[14:00:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin: although it wasn't supported before it does fix a regression
[14:00:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the reason i dont agree is it has been in the docs all along that passing query parms in the hash is 100% not supported
[14:00:31] <arschmitz> and prior to 1.3 changepage threw an execption if you tried
[14:00:45] <gseguin> not supported means we don't do anything with it
[14:01:00] <gseguin> in my opinion
[14:01:13] <gseguin> but we should not strip it
[14:01:28] <uGoMobi> is this also an issue for the query param plugins out there
[14:01:56] <uGoMobi> because if I am not mistaken one of the authors filed a bug as well
[14:02:11] <uGoMobi> but maybe that was a different issue
[14:03:07] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: is there an easier way to test this than to have to clear the cache on an iOS device and refresh?
[14:03:35] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: why do you have to clear cache?
[14:03:43] <arschmitz> oh did you x out of the banner :)
[14:03:46] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:03:56] <ryanneufeld> in my exp IOS is greedy w/ js when cached
[14:04:02] <ryanneufeld> m.gamma.metrolyrics.com
[14:04:12] <ryanneufeld> metrolyrics//metrolyrics
[14:04:59] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: ill see if i can figure something out tonight but i gotta run right now
[14:05:12] <ryanneufeld> Thanks
[14:05:14] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: but im not hopeful lol
[14:08:17] <toddmparker> sounds like topcoat is going to use grunticon
[14:08:32] <uGoMobi> scottjehl__ toddmparker : how shall we proceed with grunticon implementation? shall I continue with what is in the grunticon branch and then we look into replacing the png by a sprite later?
[14:12:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: oh that's cool
[14:13:33] <uGoMobi> so they would have to use some JS config too

[21:46:51] <ajmccluskey> Hi, I have a potential bug for jqueryui. I have a jsfiddle demoing the issue. Does anyone here want to take a look at it before I look at submitting a bug?
[21:48:04] <ajmccluskey> http://jsfiddle.net/ajmccluskey/7fy3u/'
[21:48:20] <ajmccluskey> http://jsfiddle.net/ajmccluskey/7fy3u
