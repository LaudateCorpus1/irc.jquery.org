[07:42:21] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tabs: Better event binding/unbinding.
[07:56:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: awesome
[07:56:33] <gnarf> I'll pull it down and see if I can't hack the changes I want in on the plane
[07:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if you want the submodule stuff from the Makefile or not.
[07:57:08] <gnarf> eh - it was just there to make sure they had qunit updated
[07:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> You should just pull in a tagged version of QUnit.
[07:58:17] <jzaefferer> +1!
[07:59:36] <gnarf> like, include in repo instead of submodule?
[08:00:49] <gnarf> btw - new mac... should I be using brew?
[08:01:13] <gnarf> I know there are like a bunch of pkg managers, and brew used to be cool... Is it still cool?
[08:02:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf: submodule is fine, but don't use latest commit, use tag instead
[08:02:56] <jzaefferer> I think that's what Scott was saying
[08:03:13] <jzaefferer> also brew works well for me, even got it to install phantomjs 1.5 yesterday
[08:03:18] <gnarf> jzaefferer: sure - It hasn't been updated in a bit
[08:03:42] <jzaefferer> sometime it gets messed up, forcing me to go in there and `git clean -f`, then delete whatever git failed to clean, then reset --hard......
[08:04:08] <jzaefferer> but overall it works well, worth it
[08:04:19] <jzaefferer> I'm not a fan of compiling from source
[08:04:24] <gnarf> whats the latest tag?
[08:04:29] <gnarf> for qunit?
[08:04:42] <jzaefferer> http://github.com/jquery/qunit/tags - v1.7.0
[08:07:18] <gnarf> Apparently I don't have gcc yet
[08:07:22] * gnarf grins
[08:08:20] <kborchers> gnarf: oh no! no more "special cooling port" on your mac anymore? :P
[08:08:31] <scott_gonzalez> I was actually suggesting pulling in the files and not using submodules :-P
[08:08:45] <gnarf> I'm a fan of submodules
[08:08:49] <gnarf> but I'm crazy
[08:08:55] <gnarf> kborchers: :)
[08:09:05] <gnarf> kborchers: yeah - now I have a 13" Air
[08:09:25] <gnarf> which I'm quickly falling in love with, only slightly missing the 17"
[08:10:39] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah, i have a 17" but work got me a 15" which i use pretty much all the time. now the 17 feels too big, especially when traveling
[08:10:57] <gnarf> kborchers: yeah - the air is awesome in the airport
[08:11:20] <gnarf> kborchers: and realistically, I still have a big 1920x1200 display to use external anyway
[08:11:40] <gnarf> BTW, why does mac's full screen apps just totally behave badly with 2 monitors
[08:11:48] <gnarf> making one completely useless
[08:11:48] <kborchers> gnarf: mine is still an MBP, i don't mind the little extra bulk and +1 to big external screen
[08:12:00] <kborchers> gnarf: yeah, that's annoying
[08:12:13] <gnarf> cuz I kinda like the full screen workflow
[08:12:19] <gnarf> but not when it eats up a monitor
[08:12:42] <gnarf> It'd be pretty pimp to be able to line up a fullscreen app for each monitor on each "page" of screens or something
[08:12:55] <kborchers> that would be cool
[08:18:38] <gnarf> jzaefferer: can you help me understand what went wrong here? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/19/console
[08:19:11] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I'm still on Snow Leopard and don't want to upgrade to Lion - the "new" Spaces and the "fullscreen" feature suck so much :/ Like the toggling-fullscreen animation that you can't turn off
[08:19:18] <jzaefferer> Or the fullscreen app creating its own space
[08:19:45] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I actually find it kinda useful
[08:20:06] <gnarf> jzaefferer: although i haven't played with spaces yet because fullscreen app was like my 99% spaces use case
[08:23:06] <gnarf> bbiab - gonna grab some food b4 -meeting
[08:23:49] <jzaefferer> gnarf: fixing the jenkins job
[08:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking about dropping back down to 13" MBP.
[08:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> I bought a 15" MBP two years ago because they didn't have the i5 in the 13" yet.
[08:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really concerned about having a retina display, especially for the price.
[08:30:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'd probably go with 13 if i had another external monitor
[08:31:11] <scott_gonzalez> I just use the laptop screen. I've never been concerned about resolution.
[08:31:14] <kborchers> right now i use a 19" wide-scren external and my 15" MBP screen as my dual screen setup
[08:31:28] <kborchers> 13 next to the other would feel weird
[08:31:46] <kborchers> though i'm sure i'd get used to it
[08:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> I actually don't like widescreen monitors.
[08:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because I'm a full screen app kind of guy.
[08:32:24] <kborchers> just like when i was like OH NO! NOT 17 TO 15 and now i'm like meh
[08:32:47] <kborchers> i don't full screen too much acutally
[08:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> Apps that I don't run full screen: Echofon, Skype, Terminal, Adium
[08:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> Everything else is full screen.
[08:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> And I stopped caring about dual screen years ago.
[08:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that happens when you spend a ton of time working on a laptop.
[08:34:49] <kborchers> i guess
[08:35:09] <kborchers> i probably don't need the full screen since the smaller screen is usually just IRC and twitter full time :P
[08:35:16] <kborchers> s/full/dual
[08:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> For a year after college I had a dual screen setup on my desktop that I loved.
[08:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> But after that year I started using my laptop a lot again.
[08:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> And I noticed that I didn't really feel more productive with two screens.
[08:36:55] <scott_gonzalez> And I preferred sitting on the couch or recliner with my laptop to sitting at my desk.
[08:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> A few years later I switched to only using a laptop.
[08:38:00] <kborchers> yeah, i have found i can't work on the couch ... too close to the tv :)
[08:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> I used to write a ton of code while watching tv.
[08:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> Much of jQuery UI was written that way :-)
[08:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> So, the high end 13" MBP looks pretty nice.
[08:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> Now with i7 :-)
[08:44:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: beware http://gizmodo.com/5918021/retina-display-macbook-teardown-its-locked-up-like-fort-knox
[08:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> The base 13" is .1GHz faster than my current 15".
[08:44:20] <kborchers> don't expect to upgrade anything on your own
[08:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> I won't buy a retina display.
[08:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even available in 13"
[08:59:13] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #139: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/139/
[09:04:05] <jzaefferer> The huge advantage of working on only a laptop with no external screens even at home: You can work literally everywhere. Train, pub, coworking space, conference, doesn't matter, still the same setup
[09:04:20] <jzaefferer> also the MacBook Air totally sucks for editing 16mbit RAWs
[09:04:35] <jzaefferer> That and gaming is really the only thing I use my Win7 PC for...
[09:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: 2.9Ghz i7 available in 13" MBP :-)
[09:06:14] <gnarf> jzaefferer: I have my win7 PC too
[09:06:21] <gnarf> but i have the i7 13"
[09:06:29] <gnarf> i get like ~20-30fps in Diablo3
[09:06:38] <gnarf> which isn't nearly enough
[09:06:38] <gnarf> :)
[09:06:45] <gnarf> considering my beast @ home gets 120+
[09:07:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: for photo editing, 13" screen is just way too small
[10:02:56] <jzaefferer> kborchers: wanna finish api docs content? moar xml editing ;)
[10:03:17] * kborchers hides :P
[10:03:48] <kborchers> jzaefferer: any way to tell what's done and what needs to be finished?
[10:04:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers:  https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues
[10:04:37] <jzaefferer> let me know if you need to know priorities
[10:05:48] <kborchers> jzaefferer: priorities might help ... otherwise, i would just go down the list
[10:07:51] <jzaefferer> okay, let me try and label things
[10:08:16] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thanks
[10:11:28] <jzaefferer> kborchers: updated - look for non-theme blockers for now
[10:11:55] <jzaefferer> kswedberg is working on the theme stuff, though at this point I just need to port what he added for core api
[10:23:28] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok sounds good
[10:27:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: P.S. im a fan of dialog:open
[10:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Indeed. It fixes collisions with native events too.
[10:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> Like drag and resize.
[10:36:32] <kborchers> agree as well
[13:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> .ui-button has { text-decoration: none !important; }
[13:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on removing the !important?
