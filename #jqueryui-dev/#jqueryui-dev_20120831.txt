[04:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just remove the accordion hoverintent demo?
[04:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm so tired of maintaining a third party plugin.
[04:46:50] <kborchers> gnarf: sent
[05:31:30] <gnarf> kborchers: via?
[05:31:43] <gnarf> kborchers: and what machines do you need access for?
[05:33:49] <kborchers> e-mail gnarf@jquery.com  not sure what i _need_ access to. yesterday just ran into a spot where i couldn't move a change over to the qunit.com live server (i don't even know the names of the servers) and decided i should ping you so i don't have to keep bugging people for stuff like that. not sure how often i'll really need access but nice to have when i do :)
[05:34:13] <gnarf> kborchers: well now, pushing a semver tag should cause it to update :)
[05:36:12] <kborchers> gnarf: you mean just in the commit message or something? i missed that discussion so wasn't sure what you were doing there.
[05:36:21] <gnarf> nah
[05:36:25] <gnarf> git tag v0.0.1
[05:36:27] <gnarf> git push --tags
[05:38:02] <kborchers> oh, but this was just a small change that probably didn't require a tag … i mean i guess we could have git tag v0.0.294782 is that the idea since other than that, the tags on the sites probably don't mean much right?
[05:38:06] <kborchers> gnarf: ^
[05:38:18] <gnarf> kborchers: yup
[05:38:25] <kborchers> gotcha, ok
[05:38:37] <kborchers> can probably do without access for now then
[05:38:49] <kborchers> that was really all i needed it for
[05:38:56] <kborchers> for now :)
[05:38:59] <gnarf> alright
[05:39:06] <gnarf> lemme know whenever that changes
[05:39:10] <kborchers> kk
[05:42:52] <gnarf> the "v" is optional btw
[05:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers gnart: At some point knowing when to tag web-base-template will get tricky.
[05:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> Becausing tagging will update every single site.
[05:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't like the event option for accordion and tabs.
[05:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> Why is anyone using anything other than click?
[05:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Can you deploy stage.learn.jquery.com?
[05:58:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/NUkc3g
[05:58:16] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Accordion demo: Cleanup. - Scott González
[06:03:22] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: agree on trickiness of tagging /cc gnarf
[06:04:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also really agree on events option being stupid … every time i see accordion or tabs change on mouseover i think WTF, that's annoying
[06:04:37] <kborchers> s/events/event
[06:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's deprecate them in 1.10 :-)
[06:05:06] <kborchers> let the rage begin :)
[06:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> If someone REALLY wants to use mouseover, they can write the code themselves.
[06:06:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i can agree with that and am +1 for 1.10 deprecation
[06:06:14] <gnarf> sure
[06:06:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the tagging issue with web-base-template is kind of a pain
[06:06:46] <gnarf> but i don't see any way around it
[06:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we just need to be rigorous in testing.
[06:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> Whoever is tagging needs to know everything that changed since the last tag and what it will affect.
[06:08:01] <gnarf> if I wanted to start playing with sublime text 2 - any suggested plugins?
[06:08:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: or, just create a macro in your IRC client that sends "Woops, I broke the sites again. Sorry guys! :("
[06:08:47] <kborchers> gnarf: sublime linter is nice
[06:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> Start with Package Control, then install everything else with that.
[06:09:37] <kborchers> right! package control is a must
[06:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> I use SublimeLinter, Mardown Preview, EditorConfig, HexViewer, TrailingSpaces

[06:11:45] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Accordion demo: Cleanup.
[06:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome! gnarf is working on bot.io :-)
[06:48:20] <gnarf> this isn't too bad
[06:58:00] <gnarf> testing my PR here: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/681
[07:00:32] <gnarf> this shelljs exec() sure eats up CPU
[07:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> haha, shelljs spins the disk constantly.
[07:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> We shouldn't be using it for anything that will run frequently.
[07:08:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: forgive the crappy console typed code: https://gist.github.com/b43c4c8ad04f47c6a2fb
[07:08:44] <gnarf> i had to make all the exec's "async"
[07:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, with async execs, there's not really much that shelljs is doing.
[07:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> Mostly just aliasing built-in methods.
[07:10:16] <gnarf> yeah
[07:13:39] <gnarf> I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do on a failed build
[07:29:13] <gnarf> I kinda wish this had multiple repos setup in a single botio
[07:29:27] <gnarf> don't like the idea of having to run one for each project
[07:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Which buttons does this ticket refer to? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/3
[07:47:29] <kswedberg> don't remember. probably related to doug's design?
[07:48:57] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] kswedberg pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/cY2cxA
[07:48:57] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Minor content changes - Karl Swedberg
[07:48:57] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jquery/api.jqueryui.com - Karl Swedberg
[07:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Should we just close it?
[07:49:18] <kswedberg> yeah. close it
[07:49:47] <kswedberg> sorry about that last  commit. should have done --rebase on the pull. also the minor content changes were in the Easings page
[07:50:12] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez ↑
[07:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> don't worry about it.
[07:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Just keep trying :-P
[07:51:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the /botio test ? :)
[07:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:51:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: playing around with different command stuff
[07:51:54] <gnarf> also, i keep making silly errors
[07:59:41] <gnarf> i did get it adding the swarm URL
[08:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano gnarf: Did we have plans to actually do this? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/42
[08:10:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i don't think we need it, but a whole lot of those can be automated with vagrant maybe
[08:10:50] <gnarf> set it up as a VM
[08:10:54] <gnarf> with a clone / etc
[08:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you want the checkouts in a VM though.
[08:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> Unless they're going to be able to use their normal editors on files in the VM.
[08:13:52] <gnarf> afk a bit
[08:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: How sane would it be to create stage-*.whatever?
[08:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> Like stage-johndoe.api.jqueryui.com
[08:21:45] <gnarf> johndoe.stage.api.jquery.com would be easier
[08:22:05] <gnarf> and its only mildly insane
[08:22:16] <gnarf> issues
[08:22:33] <gnarf> has to be in a different directory if they edit web-base-template
[08:22:51] <gnarf> will require a database setup step (install)
[08:23:25] <gnarf> but I did hack something like that together for the {1-10}.stage.*
[08:23:28] <gnarf> for the hackathon
[08:23:43] <gnarf> in that case, everyone was sharing web-base-template tho
[08:24:26] <gnarf> also, was your thought to check out their fork of web-base-template?
[08:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, this was a bad idea.
[08:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> So the use case we're looking at is designers who aren't touching content, right?
[08:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> They'll be working in web-base-template and nothing else.
[08:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> They should get instant gratification for changes.
[08:27:46] <scott_gonzalez> So it has to be local.
[08:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> So perhaps a database dump isn't a bad idea for people who will only work in web-base-template.
[08:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: How many people do we expect that to apply to?
[08:29:32] <ajpiano> somehwere between 8-16
[08:29:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you can do it with a VM & a Shared folder
[08:30:14] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Are we gathering OS info for everyone?
[08:30:21] <ajpiano> yep, it's on the wufoo form
[08:30:29] <ajpiano> i didn't get it for the early applicants
[08:30:35] <ajpiano> but everyone who sees it after launch will be doing
[08:30:35] <ajpiano> it
[08:30:38] <gnarf> for hackathon at least, I can have a VirtualBox VM prepped - all they would need to do is share out the folder from the host machine and it would mount it in the correct spot
[08:33:45] <ajpiano> and i'll go back and get it from early applicants who end in the pool
[08:38:08] <gnarf> my only worry with SQL dump would be users/passwords
[08:38:16] <gnarf> but i imagine I can sanitize those
[08:42:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We can just build it from someone's dev setup.
[08:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I reopened the ticket and changed the summary.
[08:45:24] <ajpiano> awesome
[08:45:38] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: did you figure out the part how it helps people style the blog
[08:45:40] <ajpiano> or am i crazy?
[08:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't.
[08:45:58] <ajpiano> if the dump includes the content of the blogs
[08:46:05] <ajpiano> then they will have the content of the blogs in their local set up
[08:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> How would the dump include blog data?
[08:46:20] <ajpiano> if the environment we create it from, gets an import of the blog data fist
[08:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> If we can't deploy the sites, then we can't generate content for them to go into a dump.
[08:47:01] <ajpiano> i don't follow
[08:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know if it's easy to import data like that.
[08:47:13] <ajpiano> the dump is a contrived thing, we can put it together from deployed sites, and the blogs
[08:47:14] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is that it's not easy.
[08:47:15] <ajpiano> it is
[08:47:22] <ajpiano> i've had the blog imported into my local wordpress
[08:47:23] <ajpiano> nbd
[08:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: It's not "copy this one WP site to this other WP site"
[08:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's merge these various sites into one and adjust all author info, etc.
[08:48:07] <ajpiano> why can't it be for the blog
[08:48:23] <ajpiano> adjusting author info happens during the import
[08:48:41] <ajpiano> and all posts can just be reassigned to "admin"
[08:50:49] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: will pick back up in a few mins, pushing the event
[09:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8544
[09:17:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: looking
[09:17:46] <jzaefferer> kinda
[09:22:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: adding a `content typeof string` check would be fairly trivial
[09:22:41] <jzaefferer> we already have the synchronous path in place
[09:23:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: as for updating content when option changes - that would have to apply to all tooltips, right?
[09:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, all open tooltips.
[09:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> Which we currently don't track.
[09:24:04] <jzaefferer> we already track open tooltips for disable/enable, so not a big deal either
[09:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, do we?
[09:24:19] <jzaefferer> `this.tooltips`
[09:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't realize we were tracking them.
[09:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> So content changes should be easy.
[09:24:52] <jzaefferer> you wrote that :p
[09:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll work on that.
[09:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you see my search page update?
[09:26:39] <jzaefferer> nope
[09:26:43] <jzaefferer> stage? live?
[09:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> local only, it's in a branch
[09:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/62
[09:27:13] <jzaefferer> just the ticket update?
[09:27:18] <jzaefferer> I think I read that
[09:27:38] <jzaefferer> yeah, needs nacin's attention :-)
[09:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> If you switch to that branch, you'll get an updated search page
[09:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> Probably fine for QUnit :-P
[09:27:57] <scott_gonzalez> Since the API is so small.
[09:28:40] <nacin> we can make that work.
[09:28:44] <jzaefferer> I don't really see a difference
[09:29:52] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, what happened there?
[09:29:57] <jzaefferer> apparently not looking at the right branch/commit?
[09:30:08] <jzaefferer> or?
[09:30:27] <jzaefferer> that branch is odd
[09:30:40] <jzaefferer> uhm
[09:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> There's a huge difference on api.jqueryui.com
[09:30:44] <jzaefferer> style-updates
[09:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right.
[09:30:50] <jzaefferer> why am I looking at style-updates?
[09:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> I only applied it to jqueryui for now :-P
[09:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> If you copy search.php from api-jqueryui-com to api-qunitjs-com you'll see the difference.
[09:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> Not style-updates, search-results
[09:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> Did you `git checkout s<tab>`?
[09:31:51] <jzaefferer> something like that
[09:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[09:32:04] <jzaefferer> looking at http://dev.api.jqueryui.com/?s=equal now
[09:32:50] <jzaefferer> better, but far from pretty
[09:33:13] <jzaefferer> with the category on top of the name
[09:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing the styles for the category page are tied to some class specific to the category listing.
[09:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's just styling. They're supposed to float to the right
[09:34:25] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:34:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look at that now.
[09:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> PULL!
[09:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What does `.hentry` mean?
[09:41:39] <nacin> it's a microformat
[09:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[09:41:52] <nacin> http://microformats.org/wiki/hentry
[09:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> So we've got rules like: .home .post, .search .post, .category .post {
[09:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which is annoying because a) there are so many of them and b) they don't apply to pages.
[09:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just change .post to .hentry?
[09:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably just adust our templates to apply a common class.
[09:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> At least to replace .home, .search, .category
[09:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> So we can just do something like .listing .hentry
[09:46:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: looks great now
[09:51:25] <jzaefferer> UI API docs looking pretty good now. Download builder is in progress. Upgrade guide is done. What's the status of the remaining site?
[09:53:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: are search results going to be paginated? or do they not need to be?
[09:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> We don't paginate them on API sites.
[09:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard any updates from the designers on jqueryui.com
[09:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what we're doing about the blog either.
[09:56:14] <jzaefferer> will the blog be just a regular part of jqueryui.com? or separate instance?
[09:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> We're supposed to just have blog.jquery.com
[09:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> No more project-specific blogs.
[09:56:53] <nacin> surprised you aren't moving everything under *.jquery.com, tbh.
[09:57:04] <nacin> ui.jquery.com, etc.
[09:57:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: do you know where it is set to not paginate results?
[09:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[09:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: re: a script to setup the sites, it would install grunt and npm comes with node, which has its own installer
[10:01:13] <nacin> just feels like a lot of effort that will not always work. computers are finicky.
[10:02:13] <nacin> more WP designers than I care to admit work on their personal server with FTP. I do hope that's different for you
[10:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[10:07:31] <nacin> it's a huge community with a very very long tail
[10:07:34] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is search supposed to improve for api.jquery.com, too?
[10:07:43] <jzaefferer> because that looks shitty
[10:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://cl.ly/image/143x2X2s3N3P
[10:08:30] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:08:35] <jzaefferer> updating content
[10:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> I updated all API sites.
[10:08:51] <jzaefferer> or not, still on 1.0.2
[10:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/9e48cbe884565102cba0eb6ccaa6d2ebf4266c02
[10:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> It actually doesn't need to be deployed.
[10:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to update web-base-template
[10:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> Which is supposed to work on semver tags now.
[10:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> So we can try tagging and see what happens :-)
[10:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try that.
[10:10:21] <jzaefferer> what's with the "version" category?
[10:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[10:10:46] <jzaefferer> well, I pulled web-base-template, and search on http://dev.api.jquery.com/?s=equal looks baaad
[10:11:07] <jzaefferer> that: http://stage.api.jquery.com/category/version/
[10:11:29] <jzaefferer> seems like that's the same as "all"
[10:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, the version cateogry is worthless. It's the subcategories that are meaninful.
[10:11:33] <nacin> it is, essentially.
[10:11:39] <nacin> we can make the /version/ category return nada.
[10:11:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jquery.com/category/version/1.0/
[10:11:56] <nacin> unless you wanted to change /version/1.0/ to version-1.0
[10:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jquery.com/category/version/1.7/
[10:12:34] <jzaefferer> well, maybe just exclude it from the category listing in the sidebar?
[10:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Nobody has ever complained about it before.
[10:13:04] <jzaefferer> FIRST
[10:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> Besides, when the site is done, clicking on Version will show all versions.
[10:13:25] <jzaefferer> you mean, the subcategories?
[10:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have subcategory listings implemented yet.
[10:13:29] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we did, I deleted it yesterday :-P
[10:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> I think kswedberg is going to work on that very soon.
[10:14:06] <jzaefferer> can we make the default theme obviously broken?
[10:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/category/version/
[10:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> That actually has a nicer output.
[10:14:16] <jzaefferer> turned out I had default instead of api-jquery-com
[10:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> How did you manage that?
[10:15:07] <jzaefferer> same issue as with learn earlier today
[10:15:11] <jzaefferer> dunno how
[10:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe you need a SQL dump :-P
[10:19:43] <jzaefferer> npm 0.0.x versions suck :(
[10:19:53] <jzaefferer> just hit the stupid grunt/node 0.8 bug again
[10:20:10] <jzaefferer> turns out grunt 0.3.x did not get updated to latest 0.3.whatever
[10:20:41] <jzaefferer> baaaah
[10:20:50] <jzaefferer> trying build-xml-entries on api.jquerymobile.com
[10:21:01] <jzaefferer> just stops
[10:21:31] <jzaefferer> time to rimraf node_modules once more
[10:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: `npm update` not `npm install`
[10:22:08] <jzaefferer> yeah, I know, but that is also broken
[10:22:26] <jzaefferer> verbose output: https://gist.github.com/bc70e97e9577fa4f287b
[10:22:35] <jzaefferer> there it just … ends
[10:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> It never did an ok
[10:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> umm...are you calling that helper directly
[10:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> I changed it to return a value
[10:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> It doens't accept a callback anymore.
[10:24:26] <jzaefferer> what now?
[10:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, did I miss a call to syntax-highlighter because it was in a different file?
[10:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's my fault.
[10:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't update build-xml.js
[10:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> sorry
[10:25:27] <jzaefferer> How did we miss that until now?
[10:25:53] <jzaefferer> good thing helpers will be a thing of the past in grunt 0.4
[10:25:58] <jzaefferer> kinda
[10:26:31] <jzaefferer> I guess I didn't update any other api repos to grunt-jquery-content 0.4 so far
[10:26:49] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[10:26:57] <jzaefferer> just non-api sites
[10:27:09] <jzaefferer> I'll fix that and publish 0.4.1
[10:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:31:15] <jzaefferer> can we get Anne to work on UI docs?
[10:31:21] <jzaefferer> mobile api docs look pretty good
[10:34:53] <jzaefferer> updating the other api repos, too

[10:36:24] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Update grunt-wordpress and grunt-jquery-content - Jörn Zaefferer
[10:37:42] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: who do I have to ask nicely to get WordPress spelled properly in the jQuery developer summit wufoo form?
[10:38:27] <jzaefferer> nacin: forwarded
[10:38:37] <nacin> jzaefferer: :)
[10:39:03] <ajpiano> sorry bout that nacin
[10:39:19] <ajpiano> i think you mean the Jquery developer Summit
[10:39:19] <ajpiano> :D
[10:39:36] <nacin> ajpiano: hah. it's okay. I think it's funny mainly because you guys totally understand where I'm coming from, given your own name
[10:39:37] <nacin> exactly.
[10:39:43] <jzaefferer> oh, also, ajpiano :-)
[10:40:08] <ajpiano> oh man i am really curious to see what the application volume is
[10:41:18] <nacin> who is reading these?
[10:41:36] <nacin> for general comments, I wrote "LARRRY"
[10:41:42] <ajpiano> me :)
[10:41:45] <gnarf> heh
[10:41:54] <ajpiano> i donno nacin we are looking for people with REAL wordpress experience
[10:42:01] <ajpiano> i donno if you fit the bill
[10:42:03] <gnarf> nacin: you need to watch koop's video just to see adam run across the stage
[10:42:06] <jzaefferer> what was the LARRRY joke about?
[10:42:09] <jzaefferer> oh
[10:42:11] <jzaefferer> now I remember
[10:42:20] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: it's from the bowling event, i think i told you the story
[10:42:22] <nacin> gnarf: I heard about it, need to watch it for sure.
[10:42:36] <jzaefferer> well, I remember koop's talk
[10:42:40] <jzaefferer> and adam running
[10:42:43] <jzaefferer> not really the story
[10:42:53] <nacin> ajpiano: There are a few WP people who I know are applying, including one of our best designers
[10:43:06] <ajpiano> ah, just that at the bowling event, some guy didn't show up and i had to bowl in his place/personality
[10:43:11] <ajpiano> nacin: chelsea
[10:43:13] <ajpiano> ?
[10:43:33] <gnarf> how do you link to a time signature in a video?
[10:43:38] <nacin> ajpiano: yes
[10:43:47] <gnarf> on youtube
[10:43:51] <ajpiano> gnarf: right click the scrubber
[10:44:00] <ajpiano> nacin: yeah, i saw that come in, i was like wooooo
[10:45:07] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=S-YKTJfZPcQ#t=1154s
[11:44:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: anything special you'd like for /botio on ui?
[11:44:35] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing I can think of right now.
[11:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just a normal build.
[11:47:18] <gnarf> i had a random thought
[11:47:23] <gnarf> i have this "public" directory
[11:47:29] <gnarf> I should put the dist files in it
[11:47:38] <gnarf> for the build
[11:47:56] <gnarf> so like - its usable in a fiddle via a link posted in the botio response
[12:03:47] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i can definitely see that being useful for the situation where some other ticket reports a bug and you're tryna figure out if it's a dup

[12:52:30] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Tooltip: Update open tooltips if the content option changes. Fixes #8544 - Unable to update tooltip content dynamically.
[12:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers gnarf jzaefferer: Useful or confusing? http://cl.ly/image/0j3b3K3C141F
[12:54:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: a tad confusing
[12:54:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, i see what's going on but see how that could make a n00b say http://izit.org/sites/izit.org/files/1329697955565.jpg
[12:54:56] <gnarf> response = function( content ) {} and content is a string?
[12:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> This is tooltip's content option.
[12:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> The option accepts a function.
[12:55:23] <scott_gonzalez> That function accepts a function.
[12:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> That function accepts a string.
[12:55:47] <gnarf> then very confusing
[12:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> The option can also just a string.
[12:55:55] <gnarf> i missed the outer
[12:55:57] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why there's the ", String" at the end.
[12:56:05] <gnarf> i thought you were passing a callback that took content as the value
[12:56:21] <gnarf> not a function that got a function that you called with the content
[12:56:26] <gnarf> :)
[12:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's a more context: http://cl.ly/image/473D2p1u2O3N
[12:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> The content option is a function, which accepts one paramter named response, which is a function.
[12:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> That function takes one parameter names content, which is a string.
[12:57:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[12:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> This must be done somewhere on api.jquery.com, because it's existing functionality.
[12:57:54] <kborchers> i would maybe go with just Type: Function( Function response),String then explain response below?
[12:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just added the details to the tooltip source.
[12:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1R103K341J3l
[12:59:45] <scott_gonzalez> I find it amazing that this works, btw.
[12:59:45] <gnarf> i think its the colon that bugs me
[13:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> You think they should be reversed like what kborchers wrote?
[13:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's how most docs are written.
[13:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> like "String content" not "content: String"
[13:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> "Function response()" instead of "response: Function()"
[13:01:13] <gnarf> Function response( string content ) even makes some sense
[13:01:35] <scott_gonzalez> So the full version woult be: "Function( Function response( String content ) )"
[13:01:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: gnarf yeah, i think even the whole thing with them reversed would be ok
[13:01:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, that's more readable to me
[13:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> Getting the whitespace correct in the XSL is oh so fun.
[13:02:18] <kborchers> :)
[13:02:24] <gnarf> A function, which will be immediately called and passed a function that should be called with the content of the tooltip
[13:02:26] <gnarf> ?
[13:02:31] <gnarf> i know i've used this api
[13:02:36] <gnarf> and i think i scratched my head then too
[13:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah.
[13:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> You'd do something like this:
[13:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> .tooltip({ content: function( response ) {
[13:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> response( $( this ).attr( "title" ) );
[13:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> } });
[13:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> Autocomplete's source option works the same way.
[13:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> You provide a function and that function receives another function which accepts the response.
[13:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's the lowest level API for async sources.
[13:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to send an email about this.
[13:06:33] <gnarf> right
[13:06:39] <gnarf> it looks much better in the example
[13:07:37] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
