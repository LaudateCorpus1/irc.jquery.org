[03:54:13] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I've finished squashing the https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8265. I'll now try to figure out if it's possible to avoid having to modify qunit, and I'll try to break up the requirejs configuration into library and testing.
[07:22:38] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[08:56:51] <gabrielschulhof> jzaefferer: Ping!
[11:35:34] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: sorry hey
[11:35:43] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: jzaefferer is with me lol
[11:44:53] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[11:45:09] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Need him to give the go-ahead on https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-qunit-istanbul/issues/45
[11:45:48] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: We need a new version of grunt-qunit-istanbul because the bridge it injects into phantomjs also needs to be AMD-aware.
[11:46:11] <arschmitz> ok no problem hes actually out on a cruise right now
[11:46:12] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: jzaefferer has already modified the bridge on master, but that has not yet been released.
[11:46:19] <arschmitz> but i can get him to comment when he gets back
[11:46:27] <gabrielschulhof> A cruise, eh? Cool!
[11:47:16] <arschmitz> or no i guess hes still at the museum boat is later ( cruise is misleading hes going on mailboat run around the islands on the bay but still cool )
[12:29:30] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Are we having a meeting today?
[12:29:45] <arschmitz> depends on if people are around
[12:29:49] <arschmitz> but i would assume
[12:33:30] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK. Well, I'll be around, at any rate.
[13:52:22] <apsdehal> gabrielschulhof: Ping
[13:56:22] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: What's up?
[13:57:35] <apsdehal> I wanted to know how were you going to fix the qunit issue with bootstrap?
[13:57:46] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-qunit-istanbul/issues/45
[13:57:57] <arschmitz> apsdehal: its not an issue with qunit
[13:58:19] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-qunit-istanbul/blob/master/phantomjs/bridge.js#L10-L16
[13:58:42] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: The latter needs to land in a release and we should be golden.
[13:59:21] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: The problem is that the current bridge assumes that QUnit is loaded synchronously with the page, so if you use AMD, the bridge throws because QUnit is not yet defined.
[14:00:10] <apsdehal> Hmm, that me the problem I was struggling with from the start
[14:00:47] <gabrielschulhof> apsdehal: The fact that it works fine in Chrome clued me in that it was something phantomjs-specific.
[14:01:23] <gabrielschulhof> BTW, I hate it when things work in Chrome but not in phantomjs :/
[14:01:50] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i got my webdriver qunit reporter working 
[14:01:59] <arschmitz> but need to cleanup the output
[14:01:59] <gabrielschulhof> Nice!
[14:02:15] <arschmitz> the hard part is diffs
[14:02:25] <arschmitz> i might just punt on it and say open the real borwser for a diff lol
[14:02:28] <arschmitz> not sure yet
[14:02:42] <gabrielschulhof> It's kinda in vain ... I'm working on improving grunt-qunit-istanbul, but we're gonna drop that whole solution in favour of webdriver.
[14:03:02] <arschmitz> and we are going to drop that in favor of intern
[14:03:07] <gabrielschulhof> Right.
[14:03:08] <arschmitz> never ending cycle
[14:03:19] <gabrielschulhof> Well, matter of length-of-term.
[14:03:40] <gabrielschulhof> We need it to work in the short term as well, which means fixing grunt-qunit-istanbul is worth it.
[14:03:54] <arschmitz> yup
[14:03:58] <gabrielschulhof> I certainly need it for the selectmenu PR.
[14:05:32] <apsdehal> Cool, thanks for help gabrielschulhof
