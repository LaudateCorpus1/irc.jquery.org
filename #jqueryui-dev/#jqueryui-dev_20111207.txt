[09:42:30] <IvanKuzev> about the dialog size animation? is there such a thing ?
[09:57:05] <IvanKuzev> i would be nice to see any answer once a day atleast here
[10:01:23] <gnarf> IvanKuzev: sometimes noone is around
[10:01:30] <gnarf> welcome to a volunteer workbase :)
[10:06:38] <rworth> IvanKuzev: there are enough open issues in Dialog that we're not considering new features at this point
[10:06:53] <rworth> not to mention work to be done on other plugins
[10:13:43] <IvanKuzev> oh..since there are people now here...i was looking at the wiki for the slider.and there said that orientation would have a 'detect' option
[10:14:12] <IvanKuzev> thats not implemented yet...but how is it supposed to work when its done?

[10:20:08] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Merge branch 'master' into menubar_otherStructures - kborchers
[10:20:08] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menubar: Update the items option in Menu to the renamed menus option - kborchers
[10:20:08] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menubar: Fix font-weight and spacing of disabled menu items - kborchers
[10:22:30] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #181: STILL FAILING in 1 min 55 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/181/
[10:22:31] <jq-jenkins> * k_borchers: Menubar: Allow structures other than just UL/LI
[10:22:31] <jq-jenkins> * kris.borchers: Menubar: Refactored _next, _prev, _right and _left into a single method called _move and then created next and previous public methods that call _move. Very similar to how Menu handles keyboard interaction.
[10:22:32] <jq-jenkins> * kris.borchers: Menubar: Update the items option in Menu to the renamed menus option
[10:22:32] <jq-jenkins> * kris.borchers: Menubar: Fix font-weight and spacing of disabled menu items
[10:23:45] <kborchers> i really need to fix those menu tests
[10:24:02] <kborchers> they'll be fixed with the focus fixes i'm doing for selectmenu
[11:17:40] <rworth> IvanKuzev: the specs on the wiki are not all up-to-date for released plugins. I updated the spec, there is no 'detect' option, if there was before it's gone and not coming back
[11:57:52] <rxaviers> all: team, Im trying to push something to editable, but Im getting an error. Does anyone know a fix?
[11:57:52] <rxaviers> http://pastie.org/2982183
[11:59:18] <rworth> rxaviers: the fix is right there in the message "Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again"
[11:59:42] <rxaviers> rworth, well, I have "git pull'ed" already, but same error
[12:00:22] <rxaviers> I have even "git branch -D upstream_editable" and re-did "git pull; git checkout --track -b upstream_editable upstream/editable"
[12:00:53] <rxaviers> I am missing something?
[12:03:48] * rxaviers trying with a clean clone
[12:03:55] <gnarf> you should be able to just "git pull" from your branch then git push
[12:04:14] <rxaviers> yeap, that's anoying me!
[12:06:55] <rxaviers> gnarf, rworth, guys take a look: (error seems to be in remote branch)
[12:06:56] <rxaviers> http://pastie.org/2982228
[12:07:16] <gnarf> apparently everyone is getting that error right now
[12:07:26] <gnarf> scott asked github to help look into it
[12:07:28] <rworth> have been for weeks, can safely ignore
[12:08:43] <rxaviers> oh really, so I will skip it, and try to push into editable in that clean clone

[12:35:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Editable: Renamed submit method and event to save. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[12:36:11] <rxaviers> rworth, gnarf, aff, it worked. My clean clone worked, but my clean rxaviers clone with upstream added didnt work either. Weird.. Well, at least one solution is working.
[12:36:15] <rxaviers> Thanks!

[12:37:19] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Editable: Do NOT create a FORM element when editing. Since W3C DTD forbids nested FORMs, Editable could potentially limit users from using it inside of another user FORM. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[12:37:19] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Editable: Minor indentation fix. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
[12:37:19] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/editable] Editable: Added select editor. - Rafael Xavier de Souza
