[20:57:03] <dpolivy> @gabriel_schulhof: how goes? I'm back with another question on some code attached to you :)
[20:57:52] <arschmitz> dpolivy: hes in finland so its pretty early there
[20:58:00] <arschmitz> dpolivy: but i may be able to help
[21:00:14] <dpolivy> arschmitz: ah, right, good call. so, here's the situation. Using jQM 1.4.2 inside Cordova. I'm using iOS' custom url scheme handler in Cordova (https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/guides/Cordova%20Custom%20URL%20Scheme%20Handling.md). In the handleOpenURL() function, I call $('body').pagecontainer('change', ...) to the desired page.
[21:00:42] <dpolivy> arschmitz: All works great and jQM navigates from the initial page to the next, but then it navigates BACK to the initial page.
[21:01:08] <dpolivy> arschmitz: from my debugging, it looks like the initial 'popstate' event fired by Safari for the initial page is getting processed AFTER jQM has navigated to the new page
[21:01:31] <dpolivy> arschmitz: so the logic to "suppress" that event doesn't get hit, specifically: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c0ba8faba37e1920d9c0f833ffb92a4ff471507e
[21:01:54] <arschmitz> dpolivy: are you attempting to navigate before the first pagechange event?
[21:02:39] <dpolivy> arschmitz: I don't think so, but I haven't tested that event specifically. I did check pageshow, and I got a pageshow for the intial page, pageshow for the second page, then the popstate came in
[21:03:17] <arschmitz> dpolivy: are you trying to navigate when the app is initally loaded? like re directing to a different page?
[21:03:47] <dpolivy> arschmitz: yes, it's happening on initial load. If the app is already running, then it all works as expected
[21:05:16] <arschmitz> dpolivy: thats because thats specificly not supported
[21:05:31] <arschmitz> dpolivy: attempting to navigage before the inital page is loaded is not supported
[21:07:17] <dpolivy> arschmitz: I think it *is* loaded, though? Just tested with pagechange and that fires for the initial page before Cordova dismisses the splash screen, then the handleOpenURL stuff is processed
[21:08:01] <arschmitz> dpolivy: browsers are very very inconsistent in their handling of initial popstate which causes a lot of issues if you attempt to navigate at some random point in the inital app load it may or may not work depeding on timing and browser
[21:08:28] <arschmitz> dpolivy: hmm its hard to say with out being able to see some code
[21:08:37] <arschmitz> but that was what initally came to mind
[21:09:39] <arschmitz> dpolivy: if you can make a reproducable test case and open an issue though we will be happy to look into it
[21:10:20] <dpolivy> arschmitz: that definitely makes sense. one solution I was thinking of is whether there's a jQM equivalent of jQuery().ready()? Not ideal, but I could try and delay the navigate until I'm sure everything is loaded -- just need to reliably figure out when that is
[21:10:42] <arschmitz> dpolivy: in a round about way yes
[21:10:51] <arschmitz> its the very first pagecontainerchage event
[21:12:04] <dpolivy> arschmitz: ok, let me look into that right now
[21:12:31] <arschmitz> dpolivy: sure
[21:12:51] <arschmitz> dpolivy: oh wait
[21:12:58] <arschmitz> dpolivy: i just added that its not there yet
[21:13:06] <arschmitz> dpolivy: lol tomorrow moring it will be in 1.4.3
[21:13:21] <dpolivy> arschmitz: was just going to ask if it is in 1.4.2 :) is pagechange an equivalent for 1.4.2?
[21:13:33] <arschmitz> dpolivy: yes
[21:20:11] <dpolivy> arschmitz: sadly, doesn't seem to work :( the first pagechange is fired before I attempt to navigate. If I delay like 5s, then it doesn't seem to happen. So definitely feels like a timing issue with processing that initial popstate from Safari. (I further tested whether that initial popstate code is hit -- when I load the app normally it is, when I use the custom url, it isn't.) Guess I need to pull together a repro for you guys to look
[21:20:11] <dpolivy>  at.
[21:20:41] <arschmitz> dpolivy: yup
[21:21:47] <dpolivy> arschmitz: ok. github repro with sample cordova app for iOS work? I'll see if I can get something together in the next day or two
[21:22:17] <arschmitz> you can only reproduce in cordova?
[21:22:51] <dpolivy> arschmitz: haven't tried outside, but can see about that first
[21:23:35] <arschmitz> dpolivy: also on the page you link they talk about the need to use setTimeout 0
[21:23:40] <arschmitz> dpolivy: are you doing this?
[21:24:15] <dpolivy> arschmitz: yup, i am using setTimeout. Only difference is if I use a large timeout (like 5000) -- then it seems to work. but that's a hack and not a grea tux
[21:24:28] <arschmitz> dpolivy: it does not work with 0?
[21:24:43] <dpolivy> arschmitz: sadly, nope
[21:25:19] <arschmitz> the fact that they say a setTimeout is required does not sound good to me :/
[21:25:30] <arschmitz> dpolivy: ^^
[21:26:07] <dpolivy> arschmitz: I think it's only for invoking UI components
[21:26:45] <arschmitz> dpolivy: or ANY cordova api
[21:29:05] <dpolivy> arschmitz: interestingly enough, I think I can repro this outside of cordova, just by doing a navigate from the first pagechange event (I do have it in a setTimeout, too)
[21:30:46] <arschmitz> dpolivy: ok
[21:30:57] <arschmitz> well make a jsbin or fiddle and file an issue :)
