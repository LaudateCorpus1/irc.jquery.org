[05:00:14] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: if the regex is /[\+\-]\d+(\.[\d]+)?%?/ I can't seem think of something that will match the regex and produce a NaN
[05:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> oh, yeah
[05:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> I guess invalid input is going to just get completely ignored for all cases, right?
[05:02:44] <petersendidit> I think so
[05:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Something like +23apples will just be interpreted as +23
[05:02:54] <petersendidit> correct
[05:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess the only case to test would be +a
[05:03:15] <petersendidit> its only going to use what matches the regex
[05:03:25] <petersendidit> I added one that has left+right top+bottom
[05:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, bug the \d is required, so that won't even match anything.
[05:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I guess this has automatic error handling built-in :-)
[05:04:01] <petersendidit> ;-)

[06:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit tj_vantoll gnarf jzaefferer kborchers: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9081
[06:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> My repsonse: "Oh, right. We only look at the margin for collision detection. Margins are outside of the element, so I'm not sure why we would include the margin when positioning the element. If you want them to be separated by 5px, you should provide an offset. What you're asking for is to position the top left corner of the yellow box at the top right corner of the red box. That's exactly what's happening."
[06:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone think this request is legit?
[06:03:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: though i agree with you, i can see how someone would expect the margin to be taken into account as well. that's a tough one
[06:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> We've been not including margin for a few years.
[06:04:25] <petersendidit> your ressponse sounds correct to me.
[06:04:37] <tj_vantoll> Same here.  I can see where he's coming from‚Ä¶ but I think that ~95% of the time you wouldn't want the position utility to account for margins.
[06:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok, closing as notabug.
[06:04:55] <tj_vantoll> And it's easy to add with offsets.
[06:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:05:02] <petersendidit> there is a way to get what he wants already built in to the untility
[06:08:12] <gnarf> offset: "margin" ?
[06:09:10] <petersendidit> my: "left+margin top+margin"
[06:09:13] <petersendidit> yuck
[06:10:26] <petersendidit> its possible though
