[06:16:39] <rpflo> ping rworth
[06:16:55] <rworth> rpflo pong
[06:17:04] <rpflo> you're up early :D
[06:17:22] <rworth> been up since 5
[06:17:31] <rworth> that's actually a bit late for me ;)
[06:18:05] <rpflo> What is the point of the ui namespace?  And users creating their own namespace?  ie: jQuery.widget('ns.foo') ... jQuery.fn gets overwritten so I don't see the benefit :\
[06:18:14] <rworth> bridge
[06:18:34] <rpflo> $.widget('ui.foo', {}) ... $.widget('rf.foo', {})
[06:18:43] <rworth> widgets live in their own namespace and their main function gets aliased at $.fn.widgetname()
[06:18:46] <rpflo> jQuery.fn.foo is overwritten by whichever was last
[06:19:09] <rworth> meaning if someone else installs a widget by the same name in another namespace only the $.fn. alias gets replaced
[06:19:19] <rworth> the original widgets live in their own namespaces
[06:19:48] <rpflo> Right, I know exactly how it works, and the point of namespacing.  But it all seems useless when $(selector).foo gets overwritten.
[06:19:50] <rworth> and then you can use the widget bridge to alias one to a different name on $.fn.
[06:20:43] <rworth> who cares if $.fn.foo gets overwritten, it's just an alias, and you can recreate it or create a different one
[06:20:53] <rworth> the actual widget didn't get overwritten
[06:21:14] <rworth> the point is, $.fn. will always be flat, we can't and won't change that
[06:21:15] <rpflo> I care because users don't know how to construct the object outside of $(selector).foo ... and I have no idea if that is already taken or not
[06:21:50] <rpflo> so how do I put $.widget('rf.foo') somehwere other than $.fn.foo ?
[06:22:20] <rworth> http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-jquery-ui-widget-factory-bridge/
[06:22:58] <rworth> http://sandbox.nemikor.com/extensible-jquery/
[06:24:47] <rworth> $.widget.bridge( "notfoo", $.rf.foo )
[06:25:24] <rworth> then $("#myDiv").notfoo() makes myDiv an rf.foo widget
[06:25:30] <rpflo> hmm, interesting... My knee jerk reaction is that since $.fn is flat it's all an exercise in futility to namespace widgets... the $.fn API is /the/ API, I know it's just an alias, but users don't get that.
[06:26:11] <rworth> what it allows is for you to write $.rf.dialog and me to write $.ui.dialog and they both live in $.fn.dialog
[06:26:21] <rworth> the only conflict comes about when someone tries to use both
[06:26:28] <rpflo> exactly
[06:26:35] <rworth> then they decide which (if either) they want to keep the $.fn.dialog
[06:26:40] <rworth> and how to access the other
[06:26:55] <rworth> so they could choose $(selector).rfDialog() and $(selector).uiDialog()
[06:27:08] <rpflo> I haven't seen documentation or best practices on how to access them outside of $.fn
[06:27:28] <rworth> but that sure beats making everyone do $.rf.dialog(selector) and $.ui.dialog(selector) all the time
[06:27:41] <rworth> when the majority of time there won't be conflicts
[06:28:15] <rpflo> Fair 'nuff
[06:28:48] <rpflo> check it: http://ryanflorence.net:8888/demos/
[06:29:19] <rworth> ok, that's slick as slime
[06:29:32] <rpflo> note the different directions when you use the nav
[06:29:43] <rpflo> hmm, lost my indicator
[06:30:00] <rworth> fantastic
[06:30:29] <rpflo> triangle is back
[06:30:56] <rpflo> demo.js shows off the API for each of the demos
[06:31:21] <rworth> love the mouthwatering SFW images
[06:31:45] <rpflo> haha
[06:32:05] <rworth> beats flickr random ;)
[06:32:12] <rpflo> bahahaha
[06:32:37] <rpflo> The custom transition in the kitchen sink demo is kinda fun
[06:33:41] <rworth> haha
[06:34:04] <rworth> you need a crazy ala gfx http://maccman.github.com/gfx/
[06:34:54] <rworth> nice to be able to hit play on kitchen sink and try out different transitions
[06:34:55] <rpflo> do they fall back for stuff w/o CSS3?
[06:35:38] <rworth> but would be nice if it was a buttonset rather than a drop-down (too many clicks and can only see options when open)
[06:35:56] <rpflo> most transitions seem "broken" when you've got transparent backgrounds on your slides, not sure what to do about that yet :\
[06:36:09] <rpflo> rworth: yeah, I think that'll be radios
[06:37:13] <rworth> doesn't seem to be a goal reading https://github.com/maccman/gfx/blob/master/README.md
[06:38:06] <rpflo> worth an example page, thanks for the heads up
[06:38:22] <rpflo> alright, I'm off, kids are waking up, thanks for the feedback
[19:11:09] <rworth> I have renamed the jquery/jquery-global repo to jquery/globalize . If you have a clone of it you'll need to switch or grab a new clone
