[05:04:30] <m_gol> arschmitz: ping
[05:04:42] <arschmitz> m_gol: Pong!
[05:05:01] <m_gol> arschmitz: what does Mobile mean by Android 4.4 & 5.0 support at https://jquerymobile.com/browser-support/1.4/?
[05:05:18] <m_gol> since they don't have the Android Browser but auto-updatable Chrome Mobile
[05:05:36] <arschmitz> So this is another place this gets weird
[05:06:12] <arschmitz> we for official support follow the same as most of the projects current - 1 etc etc
[05:06:19] <m_gol> 4.4 has non-auto-updatable Web View so that's one weird thing but 5.0 is supposed to have both WebView & browser auto-updatable
[05:06:28] <arschmitz> this is more about transitions and navigation features
[05:06:45] <arschmitz> so basicly we support android browser back to 4.0
[05:06:52] <arschmitz> anything thats ever green is current -1
[05:07:24] <m_gol> that's my point, Android has an evergreen browser since 4.4. :) And evergreen WebView since 5.0
[05:07:27] <arschmitz> m_gol: this page will change dramaticly when re release 1.5 shortly
[05:07:50] <m_gol> I see
[05:08:18] <arschmitz> we are for the most part getting rid of the grades
[05:08:29] <arschmitz> and will use a simplified format closer to what core uses
[05:09:29] <arschmitz> m_gol: none of the b or c grade borwser will have any support besdies basic will this parse
[05:09:46] <arschmitz> actually same with many of the a grade
[05:10:27] <arschmitz> skyfire, meego, us, opera 10, etc
[05:10:41] <arschmitz> old blackberrys
[05:11:33] <arschmitz> m_gol: its not really correct for us to claim support for things that core is not even vaguely thought about testing on 
[05:11:42] <m_gol> yeah
[05:13:30] <m_gol> arschmitz: do you have a preview of the new page somewhere?
[05:15:47] <arschmitz> m_gol: no sorry we have not made it yet only talked about what it should be in the general sense
[05:16:09] <m_gol> ok
[05:16:29] <m_gol> arschmitz: BTW, non-browser support on compat is ready :) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2504
[05:16:42] <arschmitz> it will have to contain a lot of notes
[05:16:57] <arschmitz> because we use stuff like css transitions with mixed support 
[05:17:06] <arschmitz> history api
[05:17:26] <arschmitz> m_gol: awesome!
[05:17:58] <m_gol> do you drop support for Opera Presto, Safari < 7 etc. then?
[05:18:14] <arschmitz> yes
[05:18:59] <arschmitz> we plan to have our support pretty much inline with core's
[05:19:21] <arschmitz> OFFICIAL SUPPORT
[05:19:32] <arschmitz> like i said we will still smoke tests all the devices we have
[05:20:11] <arschmitz> which will mostly be open demos borwse around a bit yup it works prior to releases since there is no way to automate most of them
[05:30:02] <m_gol> yeah

[10:12:51] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[10:13:03] <arschmitz> Pong!
[10:13:06] <gabrielschulhof> Hey!
[10:13:34] <gabrielschulhof> In tests/integration/dialog-extension, I'd like to turn off backcompat, but then the toolbars won't instantiate, because they use a custom initSelector.
[10:14:35] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, I should probably add data-role="toolbar" to the element, right, because that doesn't require backcompat.
[10:17:09] <gabrielschulhof> OK, I don't see why it's not picking up data-ui-role="toolbar"
[10:19:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Can't we have toolbar create two aliases $.fn.header() and $.fn.footer()? Then we could keep data-ui-role="header" and data-ui-role="footer"
[10:20:09] <arschmitz> why  would we want to
[10:20:14] <arschmitz> thats the oppsiste of what we want
[10:20:58] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, I guess if you take the step of turning off backcompat, then you're also taking the step of foregoing data-role="header" and footer.
[10:21:12] <arschmitz> yup
[10:21:17] <arschmitz> those should just be options
[10:22:20] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, and that's not currently the case, AFAIK. I hope cgack makes those into options.
[10:22:31] <arschmitz> its in the PR already
[10:25:20] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, d00d! If I turn of backcompat in dialog-extension, I need the toolbar PR first.
[10:25:56] <gabrielschulhof> Because it checks to make sure the close button works, but to do that it checks to make sure that the close button is in the toolbar by making sure it's inside the first .ui-header it finds.
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> hmm
[10:26:10] <gabrielschulhof> However, without data-role="header", the toolbar creates a footer by default.
[10:26:28] <arschmitz> so it seems like you could just not have it look in the header specificly?
[10:28:13] <gabrielschulhof> Actually, the code inside the dialog looks for .children( ".ui-header,[data-" + $.mobile.ns + "role='header']" ).first() for a place to put the button.
[10:28:30] <arschmitz> shoot
[10:28:42] <gabrielschulhof> So, if you don't add a header toolbar to the dialog, the value of closeBtn has no effect.
[10:28:57] <arschmitz> ok ok in the interest of moving forward
[10:29:12] <gabrielschulhof> I'll just forego the backcompat for now, I think
[10:29:18] <arschmitz> lets make the backcompat tests but not have them run
[10:29:30] <arschmitz> just make the look proper enough for now lol 
[10:29:36] <arschmitz> and once toolbars lands we can enable them
[10:29:47] <arschmitz> file an issue makred 1.5 so we dont forget
[10:32:37] <gabrielschulhof> OK.

[13:31:46] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ping!
[13:32:02] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: Pong!
[13:32:13] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: hey!
[13:32:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: the solution we came up with for icons is not going to work
[13:32:57] <arschmitz> awww
[13:33:12] <jasperdegroot> the problem is that the space span will be gone
[13:33:24] <jasperdegroot> that makes the icon always first child
[13:33:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: isnt that the whole point?
[13:33:35] <jasperdegroot> no matter if it comes before or after the text
[13:33:41] <arschmitz> oh right
[13:33:44] <arschmitz> darn
[13:33:56] <jasperdegroot> didn't think of that until i actually did remove the span
[13:34:22] <arschmitz> yeah that means a pseudo is out even after ie8
[13:34:32] <arschmitz> because it will always be both the first and last child
[13:34:43] <arschmitz> even the float class would break
[13:34:44] <jasperdegroot> yeah, can't do anything with selectors here I am afraid
[13:34:54] <jasperdegroot> yes, same problem
[13:34:55] <arschmitz> actual we need to revert the float 
[13:35:05] <arschmitz> to 2 classes again to support css only buttons
[13:35:15] <jasperdegroot> yeah think so
[13:35:25] <jasperdegroot> :(
[13:35:32] <arschmitz> oh well it was worth a shot
[13:35:37] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[13:35:41] <jasperdegroot> can't say we didn't try
[13:35:45] <arschmitz> yup
[13:35:58] <arschmitz> also good to know even post ie8 this cant change
[13:36:08] <arschmitz> this is not a browser specific thing
[13:36:20] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[13:36:32] <jasperdegroot> i will take a look at some other frameworks
[13:36:47] <jasperdegroot> but i guess they use class names with icon position in it
[13:36:51] <arschmitz> no
[13:36:51] <jasperdegroot> if they support position at all
[13:36:53] <arschmitz> they dont position
[13:36:58] <jasperdegroot> right
[13:37:00] <arschmitz> they all do inline from what i saw
[13:37:17] <jasperdegroot> we can still do inline without a span
[13:37:20] <arschmitz> even ones that do block buttons the icon is centered with text
[13:37:27] <jasperdegroot> but then give the icon some margin at both sides
[13:37:39] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: i tried that it looks off
[13:37:48] <arschmitz> because you end up adding to much to the non text side
[13:37:54] <arschmitz> unless you know which side that is
[13:37:56] <jasperdegroot> yeah i can imagine
[13:37:59] <jasperdegroot> didn't try yet
[13:38:29] <arschmitz> :-/
[13:38:31] <jasperdegroot> but we said it should also look good without space span
[13:38:42] <arschmitz> yes in which case the user would just type a spce
[13:38:44] <arschmitz> space
[13:38:45] <jasperdegroot> because you can leave it out if you use CSS only buttoins
[13:38:54] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[13:39:19] <arschmitz> basicly an icon just becomes a character in a way
[13:39:33] <arschmitz> you can put it anywhere and it just is 
[13:39:47] <jasperdegroot> right
[13:40:06] <arschmitz> i had an example at one point of a css only button with 5 icons
[13:40:17] <arschmitz> left right top bottom centered in between towrds
[13:40:19] <arschmitz> words
[13:40:39] <arschmitz> just to show how you could just place them however you want that they are no longer special
[13:40:43] <jasperdegroot> must have looked great ;)
[13:40:48] <arschmitz> lol
[13:40:48] <jasperdegroot> yeah
[13:41:03] <jasperdegroot> ok let's just stick to that
[13:41:20] <jasperdegroot> and to make them float use two different classes
[13:41:24] <arschmitz> yup
[13:41:30] <arschmitz> i think its really the only option
[13:45:13] <jasperdegroot> nice bug report https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8129
