[02:36:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, did you change the commit message?
[02:36:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was cross-referencing based on the short commit message.
[02:37:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, I meant that I didn't pick it on purpose
[02:37:13] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see.
[02:37:35] <_|Nix|_> Any others in that list that look like we might've missed them accidentally?
[02:38:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I thought it was better to leave it until we fixed those: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7374 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7375
[02:38:49] <_|Nix|_> ... but those are 1.5.0.
[02:39:01] <_|Nix|_> ... meaning we'll never cherry-pick into 1.4-stable.
[02:39:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the pre-rendered markup of the demos contents menu matches with the markup that is generated by the widget
[02:39:26] <uGoMobi> it's just that what we generate is wrong
[02:39:34] <_|Nix|_> :)
[02:39:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, it is for 1.5
[02:39:48] <_|Nix|_> So then 1.4-stable stays the way it is.
[02:39:59] <_|Nix|_> OK, I see now. You fixed the demos, but we need to fix the library.
[02:40:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes

[04:41:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think font-family sans-serif doesn't result in Arial on Windows with Asian characters
[04:42:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: could be i have no idea
[05:06:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: do you need someone to test something with asian characters?
[05:08:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no, I don't think that is needed. thanks!
[05:08:26] <agcolom> ok :-)
[05:09:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: on the example at http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.path.get/ we use $(document).ready(function() {
[05:10:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: right, and the script is also not in the <head>
[05:11:16] <agcolom> yes
[05:11:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you see a reason to do it differently in that demo?
[05:11:27] <arschmitz> agcolom: uGoMobi: that is nothing specific to mobile or nav so its fine
[05:11:44] <arschmitz> path is just a utility it is standalone
[05:11:54] <agcolom> ok
[05:12:00] <agcolom> ok
[05:12:17] <arschmitz> its only dependent on jQuery non of the rest of mobile
[05:14:04] <agcolom> right, so it'd be good to have those rules clearly spelt out in the docs...
[05:15:14] <agcolom> and when to use pageinit vs pagecreate 
[05:15:56] <agcolom> It'd be useful also to have a diagram of the various events as they get fired when you first load a page and then navigate to another.
[05:17:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats basicly part of the page events demo
[05:18:04] <agcolom> good :-) 
[05:19:09] <arschmitz> agcolom: http://view.jquerymobile.com/page-events-demo/demos/page-events/logevents.php
[05:19:13] <arschmitz> open your console
[05:20:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: there are a few things i noticed im fixing but you get the idea
[05:22:27] <agcolom> arschmitz: I'm trying in chrome and I get errors... I'll try other browsers
[05:22:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: odd its fine for me in chrome
[05:23:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: ha ha i left in a local link lol
[05:23:41] <arschmitz> so it will only work for me :)
[05:23:57] <arschmitz> http://jquery-mobile-event-debugger.10.0.1.29.xip.io/debugger.js is a local address
[05:24:21] <agcolom> ah, yes
[05:24:33] <agcolom> I was just going to say GET http://jquery-mobile-event-debugger.10.0.1.29.xip.io/debugger.js net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT 
[05:25:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah lol well anyway what it does is it logs all the events as they happen
[05:25:16] <agcolom> perfect!
[05:25:22] <arschmitz> along with any warnings and the description from the api docs
[05:25:35] <arschmitz> agcolom: and you can enable them on a per widget basis
[05:25:47] <arschmitz> and turn deprecated events on and off
[05:26:01] <agcolom> that's excellent! Thanks a lot!!!
[05:26:05] <arschmitz> you can also make it alert the events so it stops execution
[05:26:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: so you can see what the page actually looks like as they happen
[05:26:36] <agcolom> brilliant!
[05:27:02] <arschmitz> agcolom: and its all tied into the api docs so if we add an event or change a description its instantly updated in the debugger
[05:27:18] <arschmitz> agcolom: along with deprecated status
[05:27:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile-event-debugger
[05:28:12] <agcolom> that's really good! I was thinking the other day that it'd be good to have something that warns people that they're using deprecated features and you were already doing it!
[05:28:54] <arschmitz> agcolom: :) 
[05:30:12] <arschmitz> agcolom: the idea with this is someone can just add it to their app to debug event issues they are having
[05:30:38] <agcolom> That's really good and really useful!
[05:30:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: i thought it would be more useful then just a demo or a chart
[05:31:50] <agcolom> yes! I'm gonna do a quick PR if that's ok, just spotted tiny spaces issues, etc :-) 
[05:32:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: by all means
[05:32:03] <agcolom> Is that ok to do in the github editor?
[05:32:10] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes
[05:32:13] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[05:32:24] <arschmitz> always feel free to submit prs or issues on my repos
[05:33:30] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think we both know that self editing is not my strong point 
[05:36:01] <agcolom> sure, will do :-) these things are easily spotted by someone who's not the author as the author knows what he/she intended to write ;-) 
[05:36:36] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah im not too bad at editing other people stuff but completely incapable when i wrote it always have been
[05:37:16] <arschmitz> agcolom: i always had to have someone else edit my papers before i submitted them when i was in school
[06:04:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: ping!
[06:04:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[06:04:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so crazy idea
[06:04:39] <uGoMobi> oh oh
[06:04:59] <arschmitz> i thought of a simple way to be able to include just the css for a widget in a custom build
[06:05:22] <arschmitz> which would be AWESOME for stuff like listview controlgroup toolbars etc 
[06:06:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we just need to make them not declare a css dependency them seleves
[06:06:46] <arschmitz> but depend on a file that all it does is have the css dependency
[06:07:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so in builder you would have listview and listview css as two things
[06:07:41] <arschmitz> and when you selected listview it would select listview css
[06:08:05] <arschmitz> but when you select listview css it would not select listview but you would still get the css 
[06:09:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok so you can select if you want JS+CSS or just CSS for each widget?
[06:09:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or at least each one that makes sense
[06:09:27] <uGoMobi> and still include other JS in your build
[06:09:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like slider css alone is pretty useless
[06:09:55] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[06:10:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i ran into this when working on my mobile perf talk i didnt want the js for a bunch of widget only css
[06:10:19] <arschmitz> but had to do custom build and then edit the js files by hand
[06:10:52] <arschmitz> but i didnt want to worry about it with current builder but this is builder agnostic
[06:10:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, or create two builds... one for the CSS and one for JS
[06:11:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh yeah had not thought of that
[06:11:21] <arschmitz> but still not really a good solution
[06:11:38] <uGoMobi> true
[06:12:12] <uGoMobi> I agree it would be nice to make it possible to select only the CSS for some widgets

[07:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> You gotta love when people violate their own licensing terms...
[07:14:57] <scott_gonzalez> So many people choose MIT and don't include the license in their repo.
[07:15:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: nice in github if you start a new repo you can even just select mit and it puts it in for you 
[07:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: You around?
[07:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHAHA
[07:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> Why in the world would you ever dual license with New BSD and MIT?!?
[07:34:46] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: what project is that?

[07:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/requirejs/text/blob/master/LICENSE#L1
[08:04:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hi! I am now
[08:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> Looking at DB, it looks like some external sources are manually split right now.
[08:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Between /app/resources/external/ and /app/src/external/
[08:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> How easily can you change this to use Bower just like Globalize does?
[08:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like there are some references to the individual paths that will need to be updated.
[08:12:49] <rxaviers> That's my desire since the beginning :p
[08:13:16] <rxaviers> Let me check how things are made there again to refresh my memory
[08:14:01] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what do you think about this comment https://github.com/jquery/globalize/pull/268#issuecomment-45305642 ? He's talking about using a pattern like "{string|object}" in the expected attribute.
[08:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have a strong opinion either way.
[08:14:35] <rxaviers> Me neither
[08:15:01] <rxaviers> I still don't understand why he has this strong need that everything be machine readable.
[08:15:41] <rxaviers> will reply there too..
[08:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> I can understand some of it, but this one seems odd. I can't see how you'd have any kind of auto-recovery from that based on the error properties.
[08:19:13] <rxaviers> Let's see what he says.. :)
[08:30:52] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, app/ is confusing on DB...  app/resources/ is our kinda app/dist/ folder. But, two files are built (app/resources/download.all.min.js, app/resources/themeroller.all.min.js), all others are committed.
[08:31:49] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, in order to organize it and use bower. I would destroy app/dist and move everything to either app/src or app/external (this one imported by using bower)
[08:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'd prefer /app/external/
[08:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'd really prefer /external/ if it doesn't make things more difficult, but /app/externals/ would be fine.
[08:33:06] <rxaviers> ok
[08:33:40] <rxaviers> the build script will create app/dist by using app/src, app/external and compiled templates. Then on jqueryui.com, we move the app/dist to whatever directory we'd like (we can keep using app/resource on jqueryui.com)
[08:33:56] <rxaviers> how does it sound?
[08:34:16] <rxaviers> I mean, does it sound good?
[08:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that sounds good.
[08:35:20] <rxaviers> ok, will create an issue to track that
[08:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> Can you do it through a PR so I can check for license stuff?
[08:37:09] <rxaviers> absolutely
[08:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks rxaviers.

[11:12:12] <jperrault> @scott_gonzalez - with respect to open Globalize issues, are there any that are of particular interest to the jquery ui/mobile team?
[11:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: For UI, the high priorities are getting updates for spinner and datepicker.
[11:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> Globalize is getting close to a 1.0.0 release, you can see the remaining tasks at https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues?milestone=1&state=open
[11:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is the lead for Globalize.
[11:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> And fnagel is working on the datepicker rewrite. tj_vantoll has done a lot of work on the rewrite as well.
[11:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think Mobile is doing anything with i18n right now.
[11:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz can confirm that.
[11:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have any input for https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/167?
[11:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> Or https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/251
[11:17:21] <rxaviers> Another feature we'll probably need to implement for datepicker is https://github.com/jquery/globalize/issues/181. Although, it's on my TODO list to make a fine grain pick of what is missing...
[11:20:07] <jperrault> I'm looking for a place to start contributing, and you mentioned something about globalize during a ui/mobile meeting a couple weeks ago
[11:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, here's the quick back strory...
[11:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker curerntly supports various locales, but only Gregorian calendars.
[11:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> Globalize was originally written by Microsoft as our i18n solution, but it was based on .NET data.
[11:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is rewriting it to use CLDR.
[11:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> Datepicker has historically used community generated locale files.
[11:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> Which has been kinda terrible; constant bug reports and it's hard to track down what's correct.
[11:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> So the goal is to build the new datepicker on top of Globalize, which is in turn built on top of CLDR data.
[11:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> So we're not longer involved in maintaining locale data.
[11:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> Spinner already supports Globalize, but it's built on the old API.
[11:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> So when 1.0.0 comes out, we'll need to update it to use the new API.
[11:27:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah nothing with i18n currently nothing i can think of really needs it
[11:28:35] <rxaviers> jperrault, if you have any questions, please just let me know
[11:29:05] <jperrault> thanks, all.  good information.
[11:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: Did you ever submit a PR or polymer/PointerEvents to switch to QUnit?

[13:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> Man, upgrading from Grunt 0.3 to 0.4 is really painful.
[13:14:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah lots of changes

[13:54:15] <_|Nix|_> I'll get rid of bower_components.
[13:55:15] <_|Nix|_> OK, so rm -rf bower_components && grunt updateDependencies results in the re-creation of bower_componets, but the subdirectory named "jquery" does not contain a file named "jquery.js".
[13:55:35] <_|Nix|_> So bowercopy's complaint is legitimate.
[13:55:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: weird 
[13:56:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you do the same?
[13:56:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: i.e., rm -rf bower_components && grunt updateDependencies?
[13:56:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe there's something wrong with core's bower package.
[13:56:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: works fine for me
[13:57:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and bowercomponents is deleted by bower copy every run
[13:57:05] <arschmitz> assuming it sompletes
[13:57:08] <arschmitz> completes
[13:57:43] <_|Nix|_> So, I don't get it? Why is it that when bower retrieves jquery, the directory does not contain jquery.js?
[13:57:54] <arschmitz> does for me lol

[13:58:15] <arschmitz> Running "bowercopy:jquery" (bowercopy) task

[13:58:15] <arschmitz> >> Bower components copied to specified directories
[13:58:38] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Good for you! Fails for me. I really don't get it.
[13:59:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you changed something in bower.json?
[13:59:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not AFAIK.
[13:59:15] <_|Nix|_> I have no local modifications.
[13:59:40] <_|Nix|_> This is super-weird.
[13:59:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can try to re-clone the repo.
[14:00:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its something in master someone changed something
[14:00:39] <arschmitz> i had not updated in a few days i just pulled and its broken now
[14:00:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You updated core recently, right?
[14:00:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[14:01:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it appears that when bower copies the files for core, it does not find jquery.js under bower_components/jquery.
[14:01:36] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[14:01:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I updated the version in bower.json too
[14:01:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you do grunt updateDependencies when you did that?
[14:01:59] <arschmitz> because its failing since that
[14:02:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah, no I didn't
[14:02:38] <arschmitz> just changing the version does not do anything
[14:02:40] <_|Nix|_> Aaah!
[14:02:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you copy the file
[14:02:44] <arschmitz> ?
[14:02:49] <_|Nix|_> Now it's bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js
[14:03:01] <_|Nix|_> In later versions they've moved the resulting file.
[14:03:08] <_|Nix|_> So, we need to update Gruntfile.js
[14:03:13] <_|Nix|_> I'll make a PR.
[14:03:26] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: looking at your PR now for 1383. Should L362 of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7474/files#diff-026980f3c131b5a0fc1d5a89a595d92aR362 be using decodedDataUrl?
[14:03:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is all I did https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d8b603e632beca5aff3d05c9a363dcae1633ef0e
[14:03:58] <arschmitz> right but the jquery file is changed how did it change?

[14:08:29] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: Looking ...
[14:08:50] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: I'll answer your comment.
[14:09:05] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: sounds good :)
[14:11:16] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: ... and just to repeat myself. We don't need to decodeURIComponent() when we retrieve the value of the data-url attribute, because we should be able to assume that it's decoded, since we've documented that it must be decoded, and we always set it using the decoded version of a URL.
[14:12:35] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: just replied in github. we can move the discussion here if you prefer :) I think the point is that absUrl, which is used to create the data url, is NOT from the attribute -- it's the URL generated from the changePage call -- and so it CAN be encoded if it was created via form submission (e.g. $.param)
[14:12:36] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: If someone assigns an encoded URL to the data-url attribute, then it is that very someone's responsibility to fix that.
[14:13:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dpolivy: it sounds like your talking about 2 different scenarios 
[14:13:35] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: _createDataUrl() takes in an absolute URL parameter, and "converts" it into a data-url attribute. It doesn't read an existing attribute
[14:13:42] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: Oh, I see what you mean. We store it correctly, but we look for it using the wrong value.
[14:14:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, he's right. I should decode before I create the selector.
[14:14:31] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: yeah, exactly. also, I have one small concern that this fix could end up calling decodeURIComponent() twice on the URL, leading to loss of content
[14:14:43] <_|Nix|_> So, I need to decodeURIComponent() and then escape.
[14:15:11] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: Yeah, I also thought about that, but I wasn't sure whether that would actually happen.
[14:15:12] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: because _createDataUrl calls convertUrlToDataUrl which, in one scenario, calls decodeURIComponent
[14:16:20] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: Let's see what that scenario is exactly.
[14:17:05] <dpolivy> _|Nix|_: want to use join.me and I can walk you through it?
[14:17:31] <_|Nix|_> dpolivy: I can't really talk right now. Daughter's sleeping.

[15:42:13] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok, I've done the DB modifications and Im now finding the public external sources to replace our committed files for.
[15:42:22] <rxaviers> one of them is farbtastic
[15:42:36] <rxaviers> but, it happens we have small changes on top of the v1.3u
[15:42:58] <rxaviers> should we keep it inside of db? or host it somewhere and pull?
[15:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> Was the file modified directly?
[15:44:14] <rxaviers> yeap
[15:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[15:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> Got a diff of the changes?
[15:44:53] <rxaviers> this is the change https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/ad1f1e45c825e8c0a0c8
[15:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> Why was that needed?
[15:47:14] <rxaviers> I guess without it, the form panel doesn't catch farbtastic changes
[15:47:52] <rxaviers> they are few changes
[15:48:11] <rxaviers> ideally, we could redo that in a correct way, ie. not changing the file.
[15:48:35] <rxaviers> btw, the diff I showed you is inverse. We actually added those lines.
[15:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that makes more sense.
[15:50:43] <rxaviers> and I am remembering something. I guess it was me that added the delay. I remember this change event being triggered a lot and it was causing slowness
[15:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you can provide a callack to farbtastic.
[15:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> So I'd think you could implement the same logic outside of the plugin.
[15:53:04] <rxaviers> The fastest approach now seems to be overloading fb.updateDisplay function during runtime.
[15:53:16] <rxaviers> The correct approach seems to be using its callback if possible.
[15:53:29] <rxaviers> Are you ok with the 1st solution for now? We create a ticket to investigate further?
[15:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's fine.
[15:54:25] <rxaviers> I hope there's no "private" variable in use.
[15:54:46] <rxaviers> seems `e` is the only one
