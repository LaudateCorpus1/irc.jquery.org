[05:08:08] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, have you stopped DB?
[05:08:31] <rxaviers> or it crashed?
[05:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't done anyhting.
[05:09:32] <rxaviers> ohoh it's down
[05:09:36] <rxaviers> IM restarting it
[05:10:01] <rxaviers> started
[05:10:13] <rxaviers> at least, faster now
[05:15:43] <rxaviers> gnarf, it would be good to have an alert if a service stops. Like `netstat -latn | grep 3000` shows nothing = no download builder running
[05:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Much better.
[05:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> One nice thing about using CSS3 instead of images would be that we could process the changes in the browser.
[05:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> Would probably greatly reduce the server load.
[05:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> We could even be smart about it and generate just the rule that changed.
[05:19:26] <scott_gonzalez> For now I guess that's just wishful thinking though.
[05:19:29] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, for now, we can at least generate the CSS in the client. That would help too.
[05:20:47] <rxaviers> we would still generate the images (when needed)

[07:59:52] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, this is slick: http://codepen.io/ignaty/full/EruAe
[08:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> Check out what happens when the handles get close and then when they overlap.
[08:01:03] <gnarf> that is pretty nice
[08:03:06] <petersendidit> very cool
[08:05:04] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: the current slider code blur's the handle when it changes to disabled and a handle still has focus. Something we want to keep?
[08:05:39] <scott_gonzalez> What do we do for tabs?
[08:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> We probably want to do whatever we do there.
[08:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't really seem necessary to me.
[08:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, it's probably a bit jarring for AT.
[08:06:32] <scott_gonzalez> As long as we're properly ignoring any interaction with the handle, I don't see a need to blur.

[08:06:46] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Upgrade QUnit to 1.11.0. Fixes #8969 - Global test failure in Opera 12.12.
[08:06:53] <petersendidit> ok
[08:08:28] <petersendidit> yea we don't blur on tabs
[08:10:27] <petersendidit> and we even allow the tab to get focus if the tabs are disabled
[08:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> Also makes sense, for discoverability.
[08:10:55] <petersendidit> Could do the same thing for slider, let the slider handle get focus even if the slider is disabled?
[08:11:09] <petersendidit> As long as the handle can't change anything
[08:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's the only way to hear the values in a screen reader.
[08:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> But I guess you can't focus a disabled input, so I wonder if the logic is that you don't need to discover disabled items?
[08:28:33] <petersendidit> Would a screen reader read the label for a disabled input?
[08:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> The label and value get read, but you can't move focus to the disabled field.
[08:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> If I turn on QuickNav in VoiceOver, then I can navigate to the disabled field.
[08:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, VoiceOver announces "link" for the slider :-/
[08:35:56] <jzaefferer> VoiceOver on OSX is so terrible :/
[09:01:40] <petersendidit> So are we still thinking blur is correct?
[09:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Probably not.

[09:43:51] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, I was able to fix 8958 but I am unable to create a test that will verify that the issue exists in the 1st place.
[09:45:55] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, here is the test that I wrote for it https://gist.github.com/b690d77ec92dc039a3e9
[09:46:07] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, ^^^
[09:47:38] <tj_vantoll> djQuery: Can't look that over atm, but I can take a look tonight at the test tonight.
[09:48:31] <djQuery> tj_vantoll, don't understand why the test wont fail. currently only the last statement fails in the test
[09:50:15] <gnarf> djQuery: try doing the last part of the tests in the open callback 
[09:50:49] <gnarf> honestly
[09:50:52] <djQuery> gnarf, was thinking of doing it in the blur of the input
[09:50:54] <gnarf> when dealing with focus and blur
[09:51:08] <gnarf> there is a lot of async issues
[09:51:26] <gnarf> gotta actually wait for the browser to publish events
[09:51:29] <gnarf> rather than test in serial
[09:51:43] <djQuery> gnarf, I was thinking that the reason it doesn't fail is that qunit is running it slower than natively in browser
[09:52:00] <djQuery> maybe because there are so many other tests running at the same time
[09:52:02] <gnarf> you'll need to switch it to a asyncTest( and add a start() after you finish
[09:52:04] <gnarf> and no
[09:52:10] <gnarf> its a sync issue
[09:52:15] <gnarf> if you did the same tests in the fiddle
[09:52:20] <gnarf> you'll see the same results
[09:52:35] <gnarf> open is async
[09:52:47] <gnarf> you'll need to trap the "i finished opening" event
[09:53:01] <djQuery> gnarf, will go look it up not that familar with qunit yet
[09:57:08] <djQuery> gnarf, ok know enough about it to know what issues I could run into 
[09:59:56] <djQuery> need another variable and then incriment the variable in the open of the dialog
[10:00:40] <djQuery> so that I only call start() the 2nd time open has been called
[10:00:53] <djQuery> gnarf, ^^
[10:01:18] <gnarf> djQuery: hrm
[10:01:23] <gnarf> there is that double open issue
[10:01:25] <gnarf> doh
[10:01:30] <gnarf> maybe just setTimeout() it?
[10:04:56] <djQuery> gnarf, just adding a data attibute to the div and checking and incrimenting it before calling start
[10:05:51] <gnarf> ?
[10:23:13] <djQuery> gnarf, https://gist.github.com/b690d77ec92dc039a3e9
[10:24:49] <djQuery> fixed missing ; s
[10:31:28] <djQuery> gnarf, with that test it never actualy calls start evidently
[10:34:05] <gnarf> djQuery: https://gist.github.com/7143a5bf5e57825b5956
[10:34:14] <gnarf> excuse the shitty tabs
[10:34:20] <gnarf> gists web editor is annoying
[10:42:37] <gnarf> rxaviers: you around?
[10:43:24] <djQuery> gnarf, still never finishes the test
[10:43:36] <gnarf> add some console loggin?
[10:43:39] <gnarf> see whats happenin'?
[10:47:04] <djQuery> gnarf, added onsole.log('input blur called');  to the blur of the input and it never gets called
[11:00:53] * gnarf coins a new term 
[11:01:21] <gnarf> "debuggery" - when trying to write a unit test, but the bug is being elusive
[11:01:38] <gnarf> it's kind of akin to douchebaggery
[11:12:56] <djQuery> qunit doesnt have its own irc?
[11:18:14] <gnarf> they did -testing for a while
[11:18:19] <gnarf> but noone ever joined there
[11:18:29] <gnarf> i dunno if there is another qunit channel
[11:18:38] <gnarf> but mostly we talk about it in #jquery-dev
[11:20:50] <rxaviers> gnarf, Im back
[11:22:14] <gnarf> rxaviers: download builder was locked up when i pinged
[11:22:21] <gnarf> if you want to peek at logs
[11:22:26] <gnarf> i just restarted, it fixed
[11:22:31] <gnarf> but people were having 502 issues
[11:22:38] <gnarf> check -infrastructure backlog too
[11:22:39] <rxaviers> it happened before too
[11:22:47] <rxaviers> I noticed the port 3000 wasnt being listened
[11:22:51] <rxaviers> and I restarted
[11:23:28] <rxaviers> It was the time I pinged you about an idea of making an alert when a certain port is not being listened anymore.
[11:24:32] <rxaviers> /var/log/messages doesnt have anything from db pointing the failure :S
[11:25:24] <djQuery> so what happens to a bug if we are unable to creat a unit test for it

[11:37:02] <gnarf> is something blocking in db ?
[11:37:12] <gnarf> not responding to connection fast enough?
[11:37:44] <rxaviers> right now, what might take long is building package with images that DB needs to fetch from old.db
[11:38:29] <rxaviers> since it's a POST to /download, it's the download submit
[11:39:02] <rxaviers> When user builds a named theme, np, because we cache those images.
[11:39:31] <gnarf> but it should have responded to connection by that point

[11:41:45] <rxaviers> "If I do not change any settings and leave things as default, the download works"

[11:44:07] <gnarf> http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_read_timeout
[11:44:13] <gnarf> give me a sane value?
[11:46:11] <rxaviers> I've notice today, it's taking ~4s to fetch those images
[11:46:25] <rxaviers> usually that takes less time, like <1s
[11:46:45] <rxaviers> when we generate those locally, we'll have a better metric
[11:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Can you post the change and test you have so far?
[11:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> My attention was elsewhere for a while ;-)
[11:48:01] <rxaviers> gnarf, by the way, I've just pushed (mins ago) a new change that should make db faster. (not zipping unecessary things - which was using good cpu cicles)
[11:51:17] <gnarf> rxaviers: should i up this read timeout from 60 seconds, and if so, to what?
[11:51:41] <gnarf> djQuery: we try harder to create a unit test for it ;)
[11:51:42] <rxaviers> ooh is it seconds?
[11:51:46] <gnarf> djQuery: punt to a friendly
[11:51:50] <gnarf> :)
[11:54:39] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, we're hitting timeout to build custom themes. I suspect it's due to fetching images from old image generator. Since, it's the only apparent bottleneck. And since it fits very well to the case we have: named themes downloads just fine (since we cacha images). Custom themes times out.
[11:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[11:55:27] <rxaviers> oh well
[11:55:41] <rxaviers> using old.db was the exit we had. Since generating images was also crashing on node
[11:56:42] <rxaviers> :/
[11:56:44] <rxaviers> thinking

[11:58:06] <djQuery> scott_gonzalez, running that test without the changes to dialog they all pass
[11:58:19] <rxaviers> I will fetch images by hand using live machine (using interactive node, using my user). Let's see it that's the trouble.
[11:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: I'll dig into that in a minute.
[12:15:44] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, I've sniff tested image fetching, and it's taking 20s
[12:15:54] <rxaviers> (from my samples)
[12:16:30] <rxaviers> Im willing to put image generation live (not by commiting, but just reverting it live) and check what happens
[12:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> From old TR or from new image generation?
[12:16:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, what do you think?
[12:16:41] <rxaviers> old TR
[12:16:46] <rxaviers> 20s from old TR
[12:17:23] <rxaviers> about the image generation "live test". What can happen is we figure it keeps breaking at the current traffic.
[12:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was starving the CPU?
[12:17:55] <rxaviers> It was, and may keep starving. The only change is: I've made a change that reduced the CPU usage from normal DB/TR.
[12:18:06] <rxaviers> and it may accomodate the image generation (or not)
[12:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it's worth a try.
[12:18:31] <rxaviers> ok
[12:19:01] <rxaviers> (the next step to save server CPU is gonna be generate the CSS on client)
[12:19:28] <rxaviers> (i think)
[12:19:43] * rxaviers is gonna run the test and let us know
[12:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Well, for starters, your fix isn't valid.
[12:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> You can't move the triggering of the focus event.
[12:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...actually, are you working against the most recent code?
[12:27:55] <rxaviers> ah, we cant simply revert db on live. jqueryui.com needs to be updated as well :/
[12:28:13] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is why diffs are super useful. I can't actually tell what you're changing by looking at this gist.
[12:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm guessing you don't have this commit yet: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/d1505e3434ef99e0068347a5e8179a0ffd737676
[12:28:47] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Kris Borchers (1d 1h ago): Dialog: Move call to _focusTabbable and triggering of open and focus events into the _show callback. Fixes #6756 - Dialog: show: "blind" with link in content doesn't animate properly. Fixes #8051 - Dialog: 'Explode' dialog animation causes crash in IE 6, 7 and 8. Fixes #4421 - Dialog: Focus lost from dialog which uses show-effect
[12:30:22] <gnarf> djQuery: its easier to just push a commit on branch sometimes to show stuff rather than gists :)
[12:30:32] <rxaviers> gnarf, any chance to increase CPU power of our node?
[12:30:42] <gnarf> rxaviers: unlikely
[12:30:46] <rxaviers> ok
[12:31:58] <rxaviers> clarkbox, ping
[12:35:55] <clarkbox> rxaviers yo
[12:40:38] <rxaviers> clarkbox, if you have some time. Can you help me visualize download builder traffic? I tried this `sourcetype="access_combined" | timechart count span=1h by uri_path`
[12:41:12] <rxaviers> but, would like to remove the querystring from uri_path (Im not sure if it's removed or not already)
[12:41:28] <rxaviers> Bottom of https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/jquery_ui_download_builder
[12:44:26] <clarkbox> looking...
[12:44:39] <rxaviers> thks
[12:45:40] <clarkbox> can you elaborate?
[12:45:54] <clarkbox> you just want to see a chart with total downloads over time?

[12:46:38] <clarkbox> is that not the same as the "Downloads over time (last 2 weeks)" panel?
[12:47:02] <rxaviers> nope.. because, I dont wanna know the downloads only. But, page requests
[12:47:24] <rxaviers> like GETs to other urls

[12:59:45] <gnarf> want me to write it?

[13:47:43] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Adding a queue to deal with image creation
[13:49:26] <gnarf> hrm
[13:50:00] <gnarf> rxaviers: ^^^^ that does the queuing properly, issue now is that its still slow and therefore slowing everything down... Do any of these custom images get cached?
[13:55:39] <djQuery> resizeable doesnt have a setoption?
[13:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> djQuery: Most interactions don't have good code.
[13:56:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so um - random node question for you here
[13:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> Hence the high bug counts and pending rewrites.
[13:56:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if you got a minute
[13:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:57:16] <gnarf> I think we HAVE to cache these image files
[13:57:29] <gnarf> so it can just serve them after the first time
[13:57:38] <gnarf> as it it now, i think it has to regenerate every time
[13:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> Aren't the images color specific?
[13:58:17] <djQuery> what is the size of these images that its taking so long to get them from the db?
[13:58:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: they are yes
[13:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> So wouldn't that eat up all of our RAM pretty quickly?
[13:58:48] <gnarf> i want to cache them in files
[13:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe do a timed cache?
[13:59:10] <gnarf> why not just store the output file in a... file
[13:59:21] <djQuery> seeing as they are different colors cacheing them to file shouldnt cause a nameing conflict as long as the color is in the name
[13:59:32] <gnarf> and if it exists, you can reply with that stream, or otherwise generate/write
[13:59:32] <jzaefferer> What did introduce this problem that the PHP stuff didn't have?
[13:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> We can, but that'll eat up disk space pretty quickly too, unless we're clearing based on access time.
[13:59:36] <djQuery> or a folder per color?
[14:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> So the biggest help is probably making the client smarter.
[14:00:15] <gnarf> jzaefferer: just raw time to generate the images over here - I'm pretty sure the php code was caching something/somehow
[14:01:02] <jzaefferer> can we implement the same caching strategy? That didn't seem to have any size issues.
[14:01:45] <gnarf> confirm: https://gist.github.com/572c7cb9a6462bf66a85
[14:01:51] <gnarf> it had a script to delete
[14:02:06] <gnarf> find /srv/jqueryui.com/htdocs/themeroller/images/cache -mmin +120 -exec rm -rfv {} \; 
[14:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> There you go.
[14:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> There's a lot that we can do to make TR much less server-intensive.
[14:03:03] <gnarf> I'm just trying to figure out how I'd plumb the files in....
[14:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> But we should start with caching.
[14:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's the lowest cost.
[14:05:37] <gnarf> also where to store them?
[14:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> Just in a temp directory inside the checkout?
[14:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> That's what the old system does.
[14:09:06] <gnarf> sure
[14:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> DavidSullivan: Did you see https://gist.github.com/edbe88eed60301e43cbd ?
[14:13:57] <gnarf> man
[14:14:05] <gnarf> i think i need to just revert this in the meantime

[14:15:12] <gnarf> the load average didn't explode
