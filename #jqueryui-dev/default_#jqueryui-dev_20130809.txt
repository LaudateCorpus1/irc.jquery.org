[06:15:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you want to look into hidedividers extension with frequent before alpha 2?
[06:15:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: after reading i think it should be an extension 
[06:15:44] <arschmitz> however
[06:15:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:15:53] <arschmitz> it should not be seperate from autodividers
[06:16:04] <arschmitz> there should just be a single dividers extension that handles them
[06:16:45] <uGoMobi> but how about when you just have dividers in your markup?
[06:17:01] <uGoMobi> then you would need that extension if you use filterable?
[06:17:16] <uGoMobi> including the code for autodividers
[06:20:38] <arschmitz> yeah

[06:32:09] <uGoMobi> so I can leave my galaxy nexus on 4.2 and buy a 4.3

[07:37:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thoughts on deprecating maxtransitionwidth and minscroll back?
[07:39:31] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: is there any work in progress on a 1.4 migration guide?
[07:40:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I like the ability to disable transitions on wider screen
[07:41:21] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: to be honest, no
[07:41:32] <uGoMobi> the wiki page has been created
[07:42:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gseguin|away : I think I want to move alpha 2 to monday
[07:42:22] <arschmitz> im fine with that
[07:42:30] <uGoMobi> also gives some time to work on upgrade guide this weekend
[07:42:53] <uGoMobi> and friday end of the day is never good moment to release
[07:43:09] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: okay, well, I'm currently looking for a way to migrate custom listview icons. ui-li-icon is still in the demo, but doesn't seem to be doing anything, instead the selector is matching <img> elements, which is useless in my case, since we have another element and font-based icons...
[07:43:57] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: I fixed that after alpha 1
[07:44:43] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: then ui-btn-icon-right will be added again
[07:44:53] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: that takes care of padding etc
[07:45:10] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: ah, okay, I guess I'll ignore that particular issue and we'll try alpha 2 on Monday. Thanks.
[07:45:30] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: yeah probably good idea
[07:46:23] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: is that fix in master?
[07:46:31] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: yes
[07:46:55] <uGoMobi> you can try that already
[07:47:18] <jzaefferer> jquery.mobile.listview.css:162 - .ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > img:first-child, .ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > .ui-btn > img:first-child
[07:47:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so max width stays what about minScrollBack
[07:47:27] <jzaefferer> that's the offender for me, I think. 
[07:48:17] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: it's a bit confusing class name but ui-li-has-icon was introduced for small thumbs at the left
[07:48:39] <uGoMobi> you are talking about custom icons at the right?
[07:48:44] <jzaefferer> right, but those icons now have to be <img> elements?
[07:48:51] <jzaefferer> I'm talking about custom icons on the left
[07:49:04] <jzaefferer> in the listview demo, Icons 16x16, those flags
[07:49:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda sounds like you need a 3rd rule there that allows you to specify a class on non image element 
[07:50:38] <adavia> Any idea why i got this problem when i drag the dialog to the left.. im not able to drag it down http://jsfiddle.net/MrqDv/3/
[07:51:09] <jzaefferer> I don't quite get why it doesn't just use .ui-li-thumb or .ul-li-icon as the selector
[07:51:09] <arschmitz> .ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > .ui-li-icon, .ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > .ui-btn > .ui-li-icon
[07:51:30] <jzaefferer> yeah, that would work for me
[07:51:30] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it is doing first child just in an attempt to reduce the number of classes that have to be hand written
[07:51:45] <arschmitz> but i agree it should work also with a class like that
[07:51:48] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: sure, but `img` is too specific
[07:52:07] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: right thats why i think it should have the other 2 rules as well
[07:52:16] <jzaefferer> I prefer generating the right html over duplicating CSS
[07:52:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what are your thoughts since you wrote it?
[07:53:23] <uGoMobi> this is from the changelog:
[07:53:24] <uGoMobi> Listviews thumbs and icons (small image left): The feature to auto-detect thumbs and icons has been deprecated to improve performance. If a list item (read-only) or button (linked) contains a thumb you have to add class ui-li-has-thumb to the LI. If it contains an icon you have to add ui-li-has-icon to the LI and don’t have to add class ui-li-icon to the
[07:53:24] <uGoMobi> image element anymore. Also, the framework doesn’t add class ui-li-thumb anymore in 1.4.
[07:53:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right but issue is what if your not using an img
[07:54:08] <uGoMobi> I understand that that is the issue
[07:54:19] <uGoMobi> just wanted to show jzaefferer what changed
[07:54:26] <arschmitz> ok
[07:55:12] <uGoMobi> we use img tag in the selector now, we could look into adding another selector with a class that you can add in your markup
[07:55:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: .ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > .ui-li-icon, .ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > .ui-btn > .ui-li-icon
[07:55:41] <arschmitz> if you add that it would fix it
[07:55:59] <arschmitz> or something similar
[07:55:59] <uGoMobi> no need to look into, more matter of decide if we want to add it
[07:56:20] <arschmitz> i think we should not force img only
[07:57:10] <uGoMobi> the whole feature has always been about having img at the right
[07:57:19] <uGoMobi> it's easy to say we offer a class
[07:57:31] <uGoMobi> but we also set max width and height
[07:57:31] <adavia> =/
[07:57:40] <arschmitz> right but this is an image just not an img element
[07:57:43] <arschmitz> its a font icon
[07:59:07] <uGoMobi> yes but if you offer a class you have to make sure that whatever it is used for gets right dimensions
[08:01:38] <jzaefferer> overriding the dimensions would be easier than figuring out the icon positioning from scratch
[08:02:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: true i override image dimensions on almost all my listviews 
[08:08:31] <uGoMobi> because we set position absolute it has to have height and width
[08:08:58] <gseguin> uGoMobi: works for me
[08:09:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks
[08:09:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right set them to default and let people override if they need
[08:09:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: you were looking for me last night?
[08:10:28] <gseguin> arschmitz: I was
[08:10:34] <gseguin> question about the nav code
[08:10:57] <arschmitz> shoot
[08:10:58] <uGoMobi> if we go that way I think we should just use ui-li-thumb
[08:11:07] <uGoMobi> instead of thumb and icon
[08:11:18] <arschmitz> thats fine
[08:11:20] <arschmitz> with me
[08:11:20] <gseguin> I was wondering the closest function is looking from start to end instead of from end to start when we go back
[08:11:36] <gseguin> s/wondering/wondering why/
[08:11:59] <arschmitz> you have a link to where your talking about?
[08:12:12] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I re-created the cdn zip for google and resent it to paul_irish
[08:12:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: awesome, thanks
[08:12:50] <uGoMobi> would be nice to have at least one 1.3 version on the Google CDN
[08:13:41] <gseguin> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/navigation/history.js#L77
[08:14:42] <arschmitz> gseguin: looking
[08:16:04] <arschmitz> gseguin: i dont have an actual answer but looks like just to avoide having to copy and invert it
[08:16:12] <arschmitz> not sure which would take longer
[08:17:49] <arschmitz> gseguin: also it gives prefrence to back pages instead of front ones since most mobile dont have forward button
[08:17:54] <gseguin> it seems like when we navigating back
[08:18:05] <gseguin> we should start looking from the end of the array
[08:18:46] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: I will make some changes this weekend. Idea is that you will be able to use ui-li-thumb class and override (max)height/width
[08:19:09] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: I am going to deprecate ui-li-icon / ui-li-has-icon
[08:19:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah that would give prefrence to forward button searches though
[08:19:56] <arschmitz> which i think is what it seems like john bender was trying to avoide
[08:20:00] <gseguin> not if you exit early
[08:20:36] <arschmitz> oh and its just a for loop to so no need to invert
[08:20:50] <arschmitz> hmmm....
[08:21:53] <gseguin> just thought I'd ask
[08:22:06] <gseguin> might want to make a mental note for later
[08:22:10] <arschmitz> yeah i dont see any reason i think its just how john wrote it
[08:22:41] <asheppard> scott_gonzalez: http://git.io/top
[08:26:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: it would be more efficient to other way not sure much real difference it makes in this case but still

[09:18:35] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: sounds good
[09:41:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can deprecate minScrollback and already change the default to 0 for 1.4
[09:41:20] <arschmitz> sounds good
[09:41:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just to see how things look and if we get complains
[09:41:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah native behivor is to preserve no matter how small
[09:42:04] <arschmitz> so i think this is the correct way to do it
[09:42:06] <uGoMobi> true
[09:42:20] <uGoMobi> just not sure about apps
[09:42:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and i even tried like 2 px and it did it
[09:42:39] <uGoMobi> yeah, just noticed that too

[09:44:28] <uGoMobi> yes I agree
[09:44:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but do we offer option to disable it?
[09:45:14] <arschmitz> not sure if we get complaints we can add one though if we dont ill have to look

[09:46:04] <uGoMobi> to see if we need to offer something to disable it
[09:47:09] <uGoMobi> but then it should be true/false and not setting maxScrollBack 99999px
[09:47:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:22:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still around?
[12:22:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:22:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/160
[12:23:05] <arschmitz> drag the list items
[12:23:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh nice
[12:23:39] <uGoMobi> is that just UI's
[12:23:44] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:23:50] <arschmitz> and touch-punch
[12:23:50] <uGoMobi> saw that comment
[12:24:04] <uGoMobi> on feature request I mean
[12:24:19] <arschmitz> and basicly zero effort one line of css and one js call
[12:24:30] <arschmitz> it even updates the auto dividers
[12:24:30] <uGoMobi> great!
[12:26:14] <arschmitz> yeah could not just use autoinit sadly
[12:26:29] <arschmitz> because it would require the listview to have 2 roles
[12:49:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha got it working with autoinit
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> so all you do is add data-sortable="true" and boom sortable listview
[13:43:34] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[13:43:34] <b-ot> frequent: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[13:43:58] <frequent> `read
[13:43:59] <b-ot> frequent: From uGoMobi, 14h 11m ago: arschmitz : see here for discussion about hidedividers http://irc.jquery.org/%23jqueryui-dev/default_%23jqueryui-dev_20130722.log.html#t02:55:30
[13:54:15] <arschmitz> frequent: you still here?
[13:54:22] <frequent> arschmitz: yup
[13:54:26] <frequent> reading
[13:54:49] <frequent> irc-log
[13:55:42] <arschmitz> after reading that discussion i think the extension actually makes sense its an extension to listview not filterable 
[13:55:56] <arschmitz> frequent: though i think it should be combined with the autodividers extension
[13:56:05] <frequent> mh.
[13:56:13] <frequent> good idea
[13:56:24] <frequent> I have checked optgroup...
[13:56:32] <frequent> when filtering select options
[13:57:01] <frequent> easy fix: add "optgroup options" to the fany selector in filterable to correctly get the filterable elements (currently does not)
[13:57:16] <arschmitz> ok
[13:57:28] <frequent> then it still is not hiding the optgroup
[13:57:36] <frequent> when all underlying options are hidden
[13:57:37] <frequent> :-(
[13:58:15] <frequent> I also thought about selects with all options hidden and using min-height
[13:58:53] <frequent> arschmitz: what do you think about a default <option value=""></option> that would not get filtered?
[13:59:09] <frequent> instead of setting min-height?
[13:59:19] <arschmitz> frequent: we have a placeholder option
[13:59:33] <arschmitz> for basicly that sort of purpose 
[13:59:51] <frequent> mh... so can it be excluded from being filtered... 
[13:59:55] <frequent> (wondering)
[14:01:13] <arschmitz> frequent: check out the placeholder options here http://api.jquerymobile.com/selectmenu/
[14:01:25] <arschmitz> i think a placeholder should not be filtered at all
[14:01:55] <arschmitz> and if the person wants their menu to not collapse they could use a placeholder
[14:02:31] <arschmitz> or even set min-height them selves but it gives the flexibility to handle how the dev would like 
[14:02:43] <frequent> arschmitz: agree.
[14:02:53] <arschmitz> frequent: cool 
[14:02:59] <frequent> I thought the placeholder option was only in custom select, no?
[14:03:03] <frequent> (learning something...)
[14:03:08] <arschmitz> oh shoot thats right it is
[14:03:13] <arschmitz> :|
[14:03:16] <frequent> (maybe not)
[14:03:37] <arschmitz> let me double check but i think your right
[14:03:39] <frequent> but I did so many selects today (at work)... all with empty first option
[14:03:48] <frequent> so I thought... why not require that
[14:04:00] <frequent> arschmitz: we could still set data-placeholder in native select...
[14:04:58] <arschmitz> frequent: will need to adjust some things but yes
[14:05:09] <arschmitz> right now if you do it gets no text for some reason
[14:05:17] <frequent> hm
[14:05:31] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/162/edit
[14:05:48] <arschmitz> but i would call that a bug
[14:06:17] <frequent> :-)
[14:08:20] <arschmitz> frequent: could talk to uGoMobi about doing something like this http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/162/edit
[14:08:26] <arschmitz> for native placeholders
[14:08:44] <arschmitz> its the same idea
[14:09:06] <frequent> arschmitz: yeah
[14:09:24] <frequent> although you better not want to select bar :-D
[14:09:37] <arschmitz> frequent: well isnt that the idea of a placeholder
[14:09:40] <frequent> which is just the placeholder...
[14:09:42] <arschmitz> it cant be selected?
[14:09:44] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[14:09:58] <frequent> yeah... s-l-o-w-t-h-i-n-k-i-n-g
[14:10:03] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[14:10:04] <arschmitz> lol
[14:10:45] <frequent> uGoMobi: select rundown?
[14:10:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: frequent: anyway i gota run but feel free to leave a message for me and ill check back later
[14:10:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool that you got it to work with data-sortable
[14:11:05] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. thx a lot!
[14:11:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok later
[14:11:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah once interactions are done we can pull in and just set it up like that
[14:11:24] <uGoMobi> have a great weekend
[14:11:29] <frequent> that ... data-sortable ... 
[14:11:33] <frequent> I should have patented...
[14:11:34] <uGoMobi> yeah pretty awesome
[14:11:47] <frequent> (looks at rewriting custom JQM)
[14:12:12] <arschmitz> frequent: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/161/edit
[14:12:54] <frequent> arschmitz: ok. you can have it!
[14:13:01] <frequent> arschmitz: nice!
[14:13:10] <arschmitz> frequent: its basicly just a demo of new autoinit more then anything
[14:13:27] <arschmitz> drop in any widget and it gets "mobileized" automaticly
[14:13:44] <arschmitz> gets data- option reading and auto init via data-role="widgetname"
[14:13:53] <frequent> nice!
[14:13:55] <arschmitz> just by haveing it included at all
[14:14:18] <frequent> cool!
[14:14:33] <arschmitz> its mine and scott_gonzalez brain child 
[14:14:46] <arschmitz> frequent: and no more events for enhancing 
[14:14:50] <arschmitz> no more calling create
[14:15:03] <arschmitz> just $("#target").enhanceWithin();
[14:15:04] <frequent> will it also work for dynamic stuff?
[14:15:08] <frequent> ok
[14:15:16] <arschmitz> yes it works for everything 
[14:15:30] <frequent> so should I still do a PR for the table colToggle controlgroup not getting enhanced?
[14:15:39] <arschmitz> yes
[14:15:45] <arschmitz> because if your not using autoinit
[14:15:46] <frequent> ok. but enhanceWithin()
[14:15:49] <arschmitz> right
[14:15:55] <frequent> ok. will do
[14:16:02] <arschmitz> thanks
[14:16:05] <frequent> np
[14:16:12] <arschmitz> if you need anything pink me and ill get back to you later
[14:16:20] <frequent> will do. thx
[14:26:15] <uGoMobi> frequent: placeholder sounds like good solution
[14:26:55] <uGoMobi> frequent: we can just document that you should use that if you use filterable on a selectmenu
[14:29:37] <frequent> uGoMobi: yeah something like this
[14:29:50] <frequent> we only need to make sure, the filter does not filter a placeholder
[14:30:30] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, that's true
[14:30:52] <uGoMobi> frequent: kinda inconvenient we have like 3 ways to define a placeholder if I am not mistaken
[14:31:22] <frequent> uGoMobi: I only use the native way :-)
[14:31:46] <uGoMobi> right, problem solved ;)
[14:35:09] <frequent> uGoMobi: regarding select optgroup
[14:35:20] <uGoMobi> frequent: looks like we need to exclude empty options and options with data-placeholder
[14:35:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: ah the optgroup dividers
[14:35:41] <frequent> uGoMobi: yup
[14:35:44] <uGoMobi> did it work as expected?
[14:35:47] <frequent> uGoMobi: nope
[14:35:50] <uGoMobi> aii
[14:36:02] <frequent> adding "optgroup options" to the fancy selector makes filtering work
[14:36:19] <frequent> but then same problem like with list-dividers
[14:36:35] <frequent> = options gone, optgroup not
[14:38:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: but that was a matter option hidedividers set to false by default
[14:38:33] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15frequent opened pull request #6322: Filterable: add support for selectmenu with optgroups (06master...06filter_select)  02http://git.io/HKGidw
[14:39:01] <frequent> uGoMobi: but that was for listview = hidedividers. Same issue for selectmenu = "hideoptgroups"...
[14:40:26] <uGoMobi> I was hoping it would work with selectmenu as well because we use the listview widget to build to menu
[14:40:37] <frequent> uGoMobi: hm
[14:40:46] <frequent> native select vs custom select
[14:41:23] <uGoMobi> I don't think we support native selectmenu with optgroup
[14:41:35] <uGoMobi> besides browser support for it
[14:41:55] <uGoMobi> i think we did something that make them not work, browser support or not
[14:42:12] <uGoMobi> I remember feature requests for making it work
[14:42:23] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. Did not know. I thought optgroup was supported out of the box for native selects
[14:42:38] <uGoMobi> but could be that is changed now
[14:43:26] <frequent> uGoMobi: anyway, nothing that can be fixed on the go I believe, so that needs to wait a little
[14:43:35] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:43:49] <frequent> uGoMobi: also, custom select & filterable I think no one tried so far
[14:44:03] <frequent> uGoMobi: at least I did not
[14:44:51] <frequent> uGoMobi: don't know if _|Nix|_ added anything to make it work.
[14:45:16] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok, we can just test if/how it works
[14:45:38] <uGoMobi> frequent: if it just a simple change is need to make it work we can try to get it in
[14:45:44] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. ALso curious
[14:45:47] <uGoMobi> if not, we can add support for it later
[14:45:51] <frequent> ok
[14:46:02] <frequent> also, sorry my PRs are so clustered with unmerged commits...
[14:46:12] <frequent> I need a git-minute on the weekend...
[14:46:16] <frequent> to try and clean up
[14:46:20] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, wonder how come
[14:46:27] <uGoMobi> but I am not Git expert
[14:46:34] <frequent> neither
[14:46:40] <uGoMobi> if you start with clean branch it shouldn't happen
[14:46:56] <uGoMobi> and you can keep pushing commits to the branch
[14:47:15] <uGoMobi> maybe some of the others can help you with that
[14:47:23] <frequent> yeah. 
[14:47:27] <uGoMobi> people with more git knowledge
[14:47:29] <frequent> we try later.
[14:47:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:47:43] <frequent> I made a PR for optgroup basic support in native select
[14:47:51] <uGoMobi> we can still cherry-pick
[14:48:09] <uGoMobi> yup, just saw it, thanks!
[14:48:32] <uGoMobi> we can review this weekend / Monday and get it in alpha 2 release
[14:48:43] <frequent> ok. so still a little time.
[14:49:00] <frequent> I also PR for the 2 table issues I filed today
[14:49:17] <uGoMobi> awesome
[14:49:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ is back on Monday, not sure if he has time already
[14:50:18] <uGoMobi> but would be great if he can review during European morning
[14:50:33] <frequent> ok
[14:50:54] <uGoMobi> we can still fix bugs between alpha and beta of course
[14:50:57] <frequent> Github site also hangs here, so I can't PR.
[14:51:04] <frequent> So I try tomorrow
[14:51:15] <uGoMobi> great, thanks a lot!
[14:51:24] <frequent> ok. good night.
[14:51:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks, you too!
