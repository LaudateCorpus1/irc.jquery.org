[06:35:12] <kborchers> i can think of a million things i would rather do than to troubleshoot broken position unit tests in IE6 :/ especially when they are just weird results

[06:39:36] <kborchers> so within has a height/width of 70px, of is positioned at 20px/20px with height/width of 40px. element to position has a height/width of 10px and is positioned my left top at right bottom. this flips in all browsers but IE6. wtf?

[07:18:38] <kborchers> anyone know of an issue with IE6 reporting a drastically different element.scrollWidth than all other browsers? for the within element i mentioned earlier, all browsers report scrollWidth as 5000 (honestly not sure where that's coming from) but IE6 says 30
[07:33:19] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, Scott and me just went through the Mask issues, I've updated the todos and the functional spec, I hope that answers everything
[07:33:19] <bot-t> (46 hours 30 mins ago) <kborchers> tell jzaefferer I'll be in another meeting during the UI meeting so may not be able to give an update. TODO's here http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137997/Menu pretty much sum up where I'm at if you need to give my update. Thanks
[07:33:33] <jzaefferer> hey Kris
[07:33:39] <jzaefferer> brb
[07:34:13] <kborchers> i'll be here ;)
[07:34:17] <jzaefferer> looking at the testsuite now
[07:34:34] <kborchers> ok, i have narrowed the issue down to my question above
[07:34:50] <jzaefferer> btw. an editor that automatically removes whitespace at the end of lines is very useful
[07:35:54] <kborchers> yeah, i do have it showing me the white space with chars now but i still miss them sometimes ... sorry :(
[07:35:55] <jzaefferer> what are you using primarly?
[07:36:10] <jzaefferer> automating it is really the only way to get rid of that issue :-)
[07:36:28] <jzaefferer> primarly probably isn't a word, but anyway...
[07:37:11] <kborchers> when i'm at work, dreamweaver. at home,  a mix of vim, TextWrangler, Aptana, what ever mood i'm in ;). Work is Win7 home is OSX
[07:37:15] <jzaefferer> so on line 57 in position.html there's this gem: <div style="position: absolute; height: 5000px; width: 5000px;"></div>
[07:37:21] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:38:03] <jzaefferer> for Eclipse/Aptana you try anyedit, works pretty well for me: http://andrei.gmxhome.de/anyedit/
[07:38:19] <kborchers> cool, will do
[07:38:22] <kborchers> thansk
[07:38:26] <kborchers> thanks*
[07:38:29] <jzaefferer> set as Save Action to remove whitespace on line ends and insert trailing linebreak before EOF
[07:38:44] <kborchers> that will be very helpful
[07:38:51] <jzaefferer> is only annoying when you start with a file that is crap, edit something, then want to undo, where the last command then is that whitespace cleanup...
[07:39:12] <jzaefferer> but the more files you fix, the less of a problem that becomes
[07:39:20] <kborchers> heh
[07:39:41] <kborchers> i knew that 5000 width div was somewhere
[07:39:58] <kborchers> so wonder why IE6 and 7 ignore that?
[07:41:56] <kborchers> 8 is fine. bet it's somehow related to this http://help.dottoro.com/ljalupdo.php read down where it says "Be careful..."
[07:46:51] <jzaefferer> well, that's about zoom level, isn't it?
[07:48:01] <kborchers> yeah, i don't think it's the solution but seems like a similar issue ... might just be grabbing at straws trying to find a reason for this
[09:00:04] <kborchers> jzaefferer: you still there?
[09:00:15] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:00:44] <kborchers> so i have a solution to that issue that seems to work, all unit tests pass and the demos still work ... but i hate it ;)
[09:01:03] <jzaefferer> uh
[09:01:04] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:01:06] <jzaefferer> what is it?
[09:01:18] <kborchers> http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/XcFJr/
[09:01:58] <kborchers> performance nightmare
[09:02:09] <kborchers> when within is window and the page is huge
[09:02:44] <kborchers> huge meaning lots of elements
[09:02:46] <jzaefferer> uhm
[09:02:46] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:02:54] <jzaefferer> that's not so cool
[09:03:33] <kborchers> not sure what else to do ... damn ie6
[09:03:40] <kborchers> and 7
[09:04:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: any idea?
[09:04:25] <jzaefferer> see http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/XcFJr/
[09:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> what is this trying to fix?
[09:06:50] <kborchers> IE6 and 7 do not report scrollHeight and scrollWidth properly. the div has another div with width/height 5000 in it
[09:07:13] <kborchers> all browsers have scrollWidth/scrollHeight as 5000 but ie6 and 7 have 30
[09:07:22] <kborchers> in the example i am working with
[09:07:33] <kborchers> from the position unit tests
[09:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> can you create a simple jsFiddle showing that?
[09:08:05] <kborchers> let me see if i can throw one together
[09:08:42] <gnarf> jzaefferer: cool
[09:09:07] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah, i just started work on the hh:mm:ss am one
[09:09:18] <gnarf> still a little buggy
[09:09:20] <gnarf> in strange ways
[09:09:29] <jzaefferer> okay, any estimate for that?
[09:09:32] <gnarf> like overtyping / midtyping on it is pretty horrid
[09:09:46] <gnarf> backspacing has a few issues too
[09:10:39] <gnarf> not too long i hope, looking for a little inspiration to hit though I'm not quite sure yet, i'll knock out some of the easier ones sooner
[09:11:24] <jzaefferer> well, there's lot more important stuff, too
[09:11:36] <jzaefferer> I'd rather have you fix the remaining todos and start on timepicker
[09:12:39] <gnarf> yup
[09:12:56] <gnarf> i just started tweakin with it to see how hard it would be to get into timepicker
[09:13:05] <gnarf> so i was looking at the Mac OS timepicker
[09:13:19] <gnarf> and it seems that it always keeps the whole field you have selected "highlighted"
[09:13:32] <gnarf> i kinda like that
[09:14:56] <gnarf> and I'm not really sure on the use case for the complete event either
[09:24:29] <kborchers> ok, so there is still other things in the unit tests that change css on within so these numbers don't match what i see in the unit tests but it at least shows the difference between say Chrome and IE6 http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/WmvhT/
[09:24:37] <kborchers> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez ^^
[09:25:47] <kborchers> i think it has to do with the absolute positioning inside the relative positioning and how IE6/7 treat that when reporting scrollWidth/Height
[09:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> reduced the test case: http://jsfiddle.net/WmvhT/6/
[09:31:06] <kborchers> yeah, thanks. i was just copying from the unit test for speed, still shows the issue though. any ideas?
[09:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure Chrome is wrong
[09:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> you can't scroll the relatively positioned wrapper
[09:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> you can only scroll the body
[09:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> absolutely positioned elements don't take up space in their parents
[09:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> since they're removed from the flow
[09:34:39] <kborchers> hmmm, IE9 is the same as Chrome, FF is same as IE6 :/
[09:34:57] <kborchers> FF5, that is
[09:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> IE 6 seems correct to me
[09:39:12] <kborchers> so should i just add a check if position is relative use width, else use scrollWidth (same for height)? basically, this is determining whether or not to take the scroll bar width into account when collision detecting.
[09:39:24] <gnarf> The scrollWidth attribute must return the result of running these steps: If the element does not have any associated CSS layout box return zero and terminate these steps. If the element is the root element and the Document is not in quirks mode return max(document content width, value of innerWidth). If the element is the HTML body element and the Document is in quirks mode return max(document content width, value of innerWidth). Return
[09:39:25] <gnarf>  the computed value of the 'padding-left' property, plus the computed value of the 'padding-right', plus the content width of the element.
[09:40:24] <gnarf> kborchers: so you just wanna know if overflow is scroll or auto
[09:40:27] <gnarf> ?
[09:41:15] <gnarf> and if it is auto, you want to know if the scroll dimension is larger than the dimension?
[09:41:52] <gnarf> im a little lost in this discussion currently, so excuse me if i just went down a tangent
[09:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: it's not just relative that's wrong
[09:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> even absolute positioning is wrong
[09:42:44] <kborchers> gnarf: basically i just need to know if the element that we are positioning within has scroll bars
[09:43:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, thought that through after i posted
[09:43:13] <gnarf> yeah overflow(x|y) = scroll|auto -- if auto check scrollHeight > height
[09:43:26] <gnarf> thats the approach i think id go with
[09:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: that tells you if there is a scrollbar, not how wide the scrollbar is
[09:46:09] <kborchers> ok, let me tinker a bit. thanks for the help all
[09:46:44] <kborchers> best part is, i think i get to change a bunch of unit tests again once this is fixed
[09:46:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i don't think there is a way to determine the width of the scrollbar is there?
[09:47:17] <gnarf> might be able to feature detect it
[09:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.position.js#L23
[09:47:34] <kborchers> i was just getting that link ;)
[09:47:56] <gnarf> yeah
[09:48:03] <gnarf> thats what i was thinking of fiddling
[09:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I guess that's not what we're talking about that
[09:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> the problem is the scrollHeight > height check is failing
[09:48:22] <gnarf> he wanted to know if the element was scrolled
[09:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> because the browser is reporting the scrollHeight incorrectly
[09:48:41] <kborchers> gnarf: not scrolled, has scroll bars
[09:48:50] <gnarf> *
[09:48:59] <gnarf> what i meant by "has scrolled"
[09:49:22] <gnarf> well just cuz scrollHeight is set does not make a scrollbar
[09:49:33] <gnarf> overflow has to be auto or scroll also
[09:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[09:50:29] <gnarf> scrollHeight is supposed to return the full height of content inside of the element according to the spec i just read
[09:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> which means that Chrome is correct...
[09:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/WmvhT/13/
[09:50:54] <gnarf> woah evil
[09:51:03] <gnarf> oh nvm
[09:51:06] <gnarf> u changed numbers
[09:51:11] <gnarf> i thought it lost something
[09:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> the scrollHeight changes in IE 6 when you add scroll
[09:52:00] <gnarf> i assume IE is reporting 0 until you make it scroll/auto?
[09:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> IE is reporting the actual height of the element
[09:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> which seems correct to me
[09:52:39] <gnarf> Return the computed value of the 'padding-left' property, plus the computed value of the 'padding-right', plus the content width of the element.
[09:52:46] <gnarf> according to the spec
[09:53:00] <gnarf> "content width" would include its children right?
[09:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> the question is should it include absolutely positioned children
[09:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so, since they're removed from the flow
[09:53:56] <gnarf> i do think so, because even though they aren't in the "flow" they are a part of the width/height of that element
[09:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/WmvhT/14/
[09:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> look at the background of the elements
[09:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> the inner element (red) is clearly out of the outer element
[09:55:06] <kborchers> hmmmm, that's interesting
[09:55:14] <gnarf> if it was "removed from the flow" putting the overflow:scroll on it wouldn't effect the red box at all
[09:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> unless that changes the rules
[09:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> which in IE 6, it does
[09:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> not sure what the spec says about that

[10:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> seems a bit unclear
[10:08:47] <kborchers> right, but is an absolute positioned element considered "overflown". i would think not since it's not in the flow
[10:09:29] <kborchers> but when you set overflow to scroll, obviously it is "overflown"
[10:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: yt?
[10:11:37] <paul_irish> hi
[10:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> we've got a CSS question
[10:11:59] <paul_irish> kk
[10:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/WmvhT/14/
[10:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> should the scrollWidth be 70 or 300?
[10:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> since the inner element is absolutely positioned and there's no scroll defined on the outer element
[10:13:08] <paul_irish> hmm
[10:13:16] <paul_irish> lemme ask some smarter css folks
[10:13:20] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[10:13:23] <paul_irish> does this vary across browsers?
[10:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> FF 5 + IE 6 give 70
[10:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> IE 9 + Chrome give 300
[10:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> I believe that's all we've tested so far
[10:14:04] <paul_irish> k

[10:14:35] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid Editing: Bind to gridrefresh event to rerender ui-selected classes - Jörn Zaefferer
[10:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> if you set overflow: scroll on the outer element, then all browsers give 300
[10:15:54] <gnarf> i lean to prefer if they return 300 always -- it would make sense that the scrollHeight is the height of the scrollableContent (if it were to scroll) regardless of if it can currently scroll or not
[10:15:56] <paul_irish> scrollwidth: "Return the computed value of the 'padding-left' property, plus the computed value of the 'padding-right', plus the content width of the element."
[10:15:58] <paul_irish> "The term content refers to the dimensions of the element's content area, including overflown content."
[10:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> so it should always be 300
[10:18:08] <paul_irish> seems like it.
[10:18:58] <scott_gonzalez> it just seems odd
[10:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> though I've certainly never created an absolutely positioned element that overflow out of a scrollable element
[10:19:18] <paul_irish> hehe yeah but i like how scrollwidth hints to you that "theres more goin on here bro"
[10:19:23] <paul_irish> like if you throw overflowhidden on outer
[10:19:26] <paul_irish> still 300
[10:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> so we should file a bug with Firefox
[10:20:06] <paul_irish> +1
[10:20:50] * paul_irish checks aurora real quick
[10:21:22] <paul_irish> still 70 ya

[10:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:27:50] <gnarf> hey, do you guys think that clearing the "empty" mask on non-focus should be an option, or just the behavior in general?
[10:28:16] <gnarf> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez?
[10:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> maybe an option
[10:29:26] <gnarf> if its an option, do you have a good idea for a name?
[10:29:31] <gnarf> I was liking "clear"
[10:29:35] <gnarf> or "clearEmpty"
[10:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> clearEmpty
[10:34:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so could we do something like this as a workaround for IE6/7 and FF until the bug is fixed? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/WmvhT/16/

[10:36:39] <kborchers> i guess that might make an ugly flicker if position is being updated on window resize or something
[10:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: http://jsfiddle.net/WmvhT/18/
[10:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> if you change the position to static then it drops to 70 even in Chrome
[10:39:41] <jzaefferer> gnarf: let's make it an option, feel free to update the spec accordingly, where it currently mentions the modified demo
[10:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> any reason that should be different?
[10:42:00] <paul_irish> ummmmmmmm
[10:44:48] <kborchers> at least all browsers are consistently 70 in that case ... i think that gets into that in/out of flow vs. "overflown" issue i was trying to wrap my head around earlier.
[10:47:55] <kborchers> gotta grab lunch. will bring it back to my desk to continue convo. back in like 15
[10:53:39] <gnarf> woah
[10:53:40] <gnarf> crazy
[10:53:41] <gnarf> hey guys
[10:53:46] <gnarf> in the _bind
[10:53:51] <gnarf> in widget factory
[10:53:55] <gnarf> does that set this to the widget?
[10:54:00] <gnarf> cuz if so, i'm totally kissing someone
[10:58:23] <gnarf> hrm
[10:59:54] <gnarf> how should i check for an element that has focus in ui code?
[11:00:07] <gnarf> .is( ":focus" ) ?
[11:41:02] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yes, it does. You can still get to event.currentTarget if you actually need to
[11:41:19] * gnarf hugs whoever wrote that
[11:41:44] <gnarf> sadly i use a setTimeout in some of those
[11:41:48] <gnarf> so i still need to scope the that
[11:41:58] <gnarf> but thats badass
[11:51:03] <gnarf> so im not sure why this test is failing
[11:51:23] <gnarf> anyone around got a min to look over my screen?
[11:55:18] <jzaefferer> well, widget factory is pretty much Scott and me
[11:55:30] <jzaefferer> not sure anymore who came up with bind
[11:59:54] <gnarf> hrm
[12:00:06] <gnarf> so the focus and blur events
[12:00:17] <gnarf> the element is gaining focus or losing it, not gained or lost right?
[12:00:25] <gnarf> like document.activeElement == this in a blur
[12:00:26] <gnarf> correct?
[12:17:15] <gnarf> how would you guys suggest handling this: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/anqTY/
[12:19:20] <gnarf> i added a boolean optional param to my "paint" method that is true when in a focus event and false in a blur handler --- if not passed its set to this.element[0] === document.activeElement
[12:19:47] <gnarf> its that or setTimeoutZero the focus and blur paints
[12:19:53] <gnarf> which just never feels right to me
[12:23:28] <gnarf> im gonna commit it
[12:25:55] <jzaefferer> do you know about focus(0)?
[12:26:00] <jzaefferer> extension via ui.core
[12:27:57] <jzaefferer> that jsfiddle is a bit too little to make any suggestions
[12:28:11] <jzaefferer> gnarf, would need to see the context inside the widget
[12:40:37] <kborchers> ok, so back to the position/scroll issue. so we determined that the only time scrollHeight/Width are inconsistent is when the position of the "within" element is relative, correct?
[12:41:20] <kborchers> otherwise, even if we disagree with what the browsers are reporting, they're at least all on the same page, right?

[12:43:06] <gnarf> and there is an error

[12:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: it's relative and absolute

[12:45:11] <gnarf> i always hated that when i was trying to write widgets in 1.8
[12:45:18] <gnarf> of course, i didn't really get it then either
[12:46:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh, right. ok.

[12:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> hah, check out this awesome quote from several years ago
[12:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> "it would add a lot of code with the current way UI plugins are implemented though
[12:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> but that wouldn't be true if UI used the widget factory"
[12:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> not sure if the widget factory was vaporware at that point

[13:29:26] <kborchers> sure one sec
[13:29:34] <gnarf> whats your skype?
[13:29:54] <kborchers> kris.borchers
[13:32:17] <gnarf> kborchers: are you talking about in the time one, or in all of them?
[13:32:40] <kborchers> time
[13:32:45] <gnarf> yeah
[13:32:49] <gnarf> thats actually expected
[13:33:04] <kborchers> ?
[13:33:05] <kborchers> <gnarf> i got the "single number right arrow" working in the time fields
[13:33:07] <gnarf> it will make more sense when it does what i really want it to do
[13:33:14] <gnarf> which is highlight the next field
[13:33:34] <gnarf> the left arrow doing the inverse
[13:33:40] <gnarf> just haven't written that logic in there yet
[13:33:59] <gnarf> right type "5" then hit right
[13:34:05] <gnarf> it makes it "05"
[13:34:18] <kborchers> aaahhhh, i see
[13:34:34] <kborchers> thought you meant right arrow moved one spot
[13:34:58] <gnarf> nah, in the "multi char" fields i want it to skip to the next field
[13:35:10] <kborchers> right, makes sense
[13:35:16] <kborchers> so nobody wants to have any more fun with position today?
[13:35:26] <gnarf> what was the latest again? :)
[13:35:34] <gnarf> or do you wanna give me the screen share demo? :)
[13:35:55] <kborchers> wondering if anyone had a problem with this solution http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/z4kTG/
[13:36:18] <kborchers> all unit tests pass and visuals still look fine too
[13:36:39] <gnarf> kborchers: can you gist the git diff or point me a commit in yer repo?
[13:36:58] <gnarf> the "tidy up" is making this a bit of a bitch
[13:37:20] <kborchers> i haven't commited it yet ... i'll do that since i'm happy with it ;) one sec
[13:37:52] <gnarf> tweaking the visibility/overflow kinda bugs me
[13:38:08] <gnarf> not to say that i'm not forced to do that for effects
[13:38:43] <kborchers> me too, but couldn't think of another way to do it ... thus storing the vals in data to not do it all the time
[13:39:10] <gnarf> also, thats not going to be invalidated if content changes
[13:39:32] <gnarf> out of curiosty
[13:39:45] <gnarf> this info only matters if the overflow is scroll or auto right?
[13:40:11] <gnarf> if its hidden or visible it doesn't scroll so you want to return false right?
[13:40:29] <gnarf> and those problem browsers still only report incorrect values when the overflow is not scroll or auto right?
[13:40:41] <kborchers> sounds right, yeah.
[13:40:42] <gnarf> why not just return false if overflow isn't scroll or auto
[13:40:47] <gnarf> and skip all this bs
[13:41:07] <kborchers> hmmmm
[13:41:30] <kborchers> good point, ok let me look at that before i commit to my repo. thanks
[13:44:47] <gnarf> var scrollbarWidth, overflow = within.css("overflow"), overflows = overflow === "auto" || overflow === "scroll";  if ( overflows ) { scrollbarWidth = $.position.scrollbarWidth(); } return { height: scrollbarWidth && within.height() < within[0].scrollHeight ? scrollbarWidth : 0, ... };
[13:45:16] <gnarf> er that return should be overflows &&
[13:45:41] <gnarf> this way you even skip calcing the scrollbarWidth if you know its gonna be returning 0 too
[13:46:09] <kborchers> ooohhhh, pretty. i was close to that but did not elimate that calc, thanks i'll try it
[13:47:33] <gnarf> although actually, since scrollbarWidth would be falsy
[13:47:38] <gnarf> you could not save overflows =
[13:47:46] <gnarf> and just set scrollbarWidth when
[13:47:57] <gnarf> and use it in the return
[13:47:58] <gnarf> lol
[13:48:05] <gnarf> save yourself like 2 bytes in the minified file ;)
[13:48:11] <gnarf> maybe 3
[13:48:14] <gnarf> 3
[13:55:52] <kborchers> gnarf: i think that'll work. had to add a check to make sure within isn't window since window.css get's angry ;) now some tests are failing but i think they were falsely passing before
[13:56:28] <gnarf> roger
[16:29:06] <nimbu> scott_gonzalez: hi, I was directed here by paul_irish because you promised to file the bug for FF on scrollwidth :) so I was wondering if you had the bug id / link
[17:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> hey nimbu
[17:54:17] <nimbu> hey scott_gonzalez!
[17:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't filed a ticket yet
[17:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> but here's the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/WmvhT/14/
[17:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> the scrollWidth isn't taking the absolutely positioned element into account
[17:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> if you add overflow: scroll, then it reports the correct size of 300
[17:58:10] <nimbu> yeah seems like opera has the same issue.
[17:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> and old IEs
[17:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> WebKit and newer IEs get it right
[17:59:39] <nimbu> i found a similar issue here: but i guess its not the same (and no fiddle to test) https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=582722
[18:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm filing the ticket rigth now
[18:01:16] <nimbu> sweet thanks!! i am just gonna file it internally at opera too, seems like we have a few scrollwidth bugs
[18:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678678
[18:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: tell nimbu I filed the bug at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678678
[18:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> and the test page is at http://dev-test.nemikor.com/bugs/firefox/scrollwidth-absolute-child.html

[19:45:13] <kborchers> i don't know if he even saw the finished product but it seems to work really well
[19:45:55] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[19:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> what about overflow-x and overflow-y?
[19:46:26] <kborchers> damn it! party pooper!
[19:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[19:47:55] <kborchers> hmmm and i can't just add checks for those with the overflow check since the scrollbarWidth and Height would need to be different if only one of those were applied
[19:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[19:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> so I've been digging out a tree stump
[19:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> and since I live in NC the ground is all clay
[19:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> so I'm standing there digging in nothing but clay, rocks and roots
[19:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> thinking this is the physical equivalent of the crap we do all day
[19:50:50] <kborchers> lol ... that's hilarious and true!
[19:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> and just for kicks, there are always cables and pipes where I'm digging
[19:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> those must be the equivalent of things like overflow-x
[19:52:02] <kborchers> nice
[19:52:33] <kborchers> so what you need is a backhoe ... wonder what the JS equivalent of that is ;)
[19:53:01] <scott_gonzalez> Node :-P
[19:53:05] <kborchers> heh
[19:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> the problem with the backhoe is the cables and pipes
[19:53:28] <kborchers> right, was just thinking that
[19:54:27] <kborchers> so what you need is the real world equivalent of $("stump").remove();
[19:55:03] <kborchers> i think that would be ... hire someone else to do it ;)
[19:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> too bad there's no equivalent of open source devs for removing stumps
[19:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> only commercial options :-P
[19:57:31] <kborchers> maybe a case of beer and some buddies with little to no experience removing stumps
[19:57:49] <kborchers> but willing to learn
[19:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[20:03:38] <kborchers> do you know if this will work in all browsers? http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/VBfyb/  do you have any version(s) of IE readily available to test?
[20:04:29] <kborchers> just wondering if i can just check overflow-x and overflow-y and not worry about overflow. it works in Chrome, Safari and FF5
[20:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I can test in IE 6
[20:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup, says scroll scroll
[20:06:06] <kborchers> ok, thanks
