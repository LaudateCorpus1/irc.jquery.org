[04:40:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[04:40:57] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pong!
[04:41:02] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7586
[04:41:36] <gabriel_schulhof> We support same-page transitions, but the support is not complete. We only support explicit navigation to the same page, not returning to it via the back/forward button.
[04:41:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok
[04:41:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Do we want to implement such support?
[04:42:09] <gabriel_schulhof> The solution looks to be pretty simple.
[04:42:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: whats with no description on that issue where did jsbin come from why did you even look at such an empty issue?
[04:42:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... because its fairly self-explanatory. I was going to slam it shut with the jsbin, but then I realized that the support is limited to explicit navigation.
[04:43:09] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: pretty sure thats intentional
[04:43:32] <arschmitz> we didnt really want people doing it
[04:43:47] <arschmitz> unless they REALLY wanted it and knew what they were doing
[04:44:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you end up with a copy of something in the dom which likely contains ids
[04:44:20] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its kinda asking for trouble
[04:44:52] <gabriel_schulhof> ... actually, you don't end up with a copy.
[04:45:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: how do you not
[04:45:18] <arschmitz> ?
[04:45:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It uses the same element for both the source page and the destination page and it applies the transition like that.
[04:45:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what about slide?
[04:45:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The API docs explicitly say that you have to choose the transition carefully.
[04:46:02] <arschmitz> both pages are visible at same time so it has to be copied
[04:46:07] <gabriel_schulhof> Nope.
[04:46:14] <gabriel_schulhof> We documentedly do not support that.
[04:46:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Fade works fine, however.,
[04:46:26] <arschmitz> oh wiat im thinking of reload page
[04:46:40] <arschmitz> which there is also an issue about
[04:47:03] <gabriel_schulhof> My solution to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1867 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7485) works for this issue as well.
[04:47:30] <arschmitz> either way im fine with only supporting it through change method 
[04:47:37] <gabriel_schulhof> i.e., store the fact that the history entry was reached via allowSamePageTransition in the urlHistory, and then retrieve that upon _handleNavigate
[04:48:18] <gabriel_schulhof> Hmmm ... I can make probably it an extension to pagecontainer, if necessary.
[04:49:07] <gabriel_schulhof> OK ... I've done some work in this direction, because the change to make it work is small, however, if you're not 100% behind implementing this feature, I'm not going to proceed with analyzing all the ramifications of the change and writing all the tests.
[04:49:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: where would you even specify the option
[04:49:42] <arschmitz> its on option on each page yet not a page option
[04:49:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono.
[04:49:55] <arschmitz> its gets really murky 
[04:50:00] <gabriel_schulhof> The initial navigation still happens via .pagecontainer( "change", .... )
[04:50:19] <gabriel_schulhof> However, subsequent access of the page via back/forward buttons results in expected behaviour.
[04:50:30] <arschmitz> im talking about the first issue you sent
[04:50:31] <gabriel_schulhof> i.e., the page appears via the transition that was used to reach it in the first place.
[04:50:45] <arschmitz> wait maybe im misunderstanding the issue
[04:51:12] <arschmitz> is the issue you want to add a data-attribute for same page transition or that you want it to work with backbutton?
[04:51:28] <gabriel_schulhof> I want it to work with the back/forward buttons.
[04:51:37] <gabriel_schulhof> I don't strongly want it, but it'd be nice.
[04:51:59] <arschmitz> ok that im much more ok with
[04:52:26] <arschmitz> i thought you wanted to make it so you could do it via attribute and not just explicitly through change method
[04:52:50] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, come to think of it ... but no, via change method is enough for now, because it's not a wide use-case.
[04:53:05] <arschmitz> i thought thats what you meant by explicit is that you had to use change method and couldnt do it with out js
[04:53:36] <arschmitz> i dont want to add an attirubte for it but it should work properly as far as transition direction
[04:53:48] <gabriel_schulhof> I'm on the same page as you.
[04:54:05] <arschmitz> cool
[04:54:08] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and like I said, my solution for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1867 covers this too.
[04:54:18] <arschmitz> makes sense its the same thing
[04:54:28] <arschmitz> just happening by slightly different route
[04:55:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Basically, the heuristic we use to retrieve stuff from urlHistory in order to decide which transition to use can also be applied to deciding whether this is supposed to be a same-page transition or not.
[04:55:52] <gabriel_schulhof> The only additional thing we have to do in this case is store the fact that the urlHistory entry is the result of a same-page transition.
[04:56:04] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and that
[04:56:10] <gabriel_schulhof> 's easy enough to do.
[04:56:40] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I'll go ahead and make sure allowSamePageTransition works as expected in all cases, and write tests to that effect.
[04:57:05] <arschmitz> sounds good
[04:57:05] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose this is big enough to wait until 1.5.0, right?
[04:57:11] <arschmitz> yes
[04:57:17] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll re-milestone.
[05:04:45] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Since I'll need the changes I've made in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7485, could you please review that?

[06:39:53] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: I looked in to #10351, looks like the way it "worked" in 1.9 was the resize would get triggered once and they would set the size.* to the desired value. Then the resize would get triggered again (because the user is still dragging) and the size.* that values that the set last time would get used.
[06:40:03] <petersendidit> We can restore that behaviour but that seems wrong.  Seems like what you really want it to not depend on the resize event being triggered twice.

[09:16:25] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: Widget: Improve performance of cleanData method
[09:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: I have a request for dev tools.
[09:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if others have requested this already.
[09:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> When looking at styles, I often want to change a property that will no longer apply as soon as I click in the dev tools.
[09:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> For example, classes managed via script based on focus/hover.
[09:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> So, not using things like :focus.
[09:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to be able to click on the property and have it actually stay there so I can edit it.
[09:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> This seems like a really though thing to implement though because the mousedown on the dev tools causes the class to be removed.
[09:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> So by the time the click happens, the property I care about is already gone.
[10:03:00] <gseguin> arschmitz: ping
[10:03:14] <arschmitz> gseguin: Pong!
[10:03:28] <gseguin> arschmitz: any luck with that iframe nightmare?
[10:03:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: no and from the sounds im not sure there is much we can do
[10:03:58] <arschmitz> based on the SO posts
[10:04:20] <gseguin> arschmitz: that breaks my heart :(
[10:05:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah its not a jqm thing
[10:05:41] <gseguin> arschmitz: well... if you don't bind on vclick it doesn't happen
[10:06:00] <gseguin> arschmitz: so that's arguable
[10:06:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah because it has to do with listening to touchmove
[10:06:11] <arschmitz> or any touch event
[10:06:20] <gseguin> right
[10:06:24] <arschmitz> so if you dont care about touch events sure you can work around it
[10:06:30] <arschmitz> but thats the whole point of vclick
[10:08:45] <gseguin> arschmitz: do you think jquery-pointer-events is ready enough and that it would solve the issue? It seems that the problem would be the same, doesn't it?
[10:10:17] <arschmitz> gseguin: as far as if its ready no its not ready for real use kris said to not even use it in my test branch yet 
[10:10:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: to see if it will fix though is easy
[10:10:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: do you still have that test jsbin?
[10:10:46] <gseguin> ok, I'll give it a shot
[10:10:49] <gseguin> let me find it
[10:11:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: i can check very easily if you do
[10:11:20] <gseguin> http://jsbin.com/qudeniwo/19/edit
[10:11:33] <arschmitz> ok just a minute
[10:15:20] <arschmitz> nope same
[10:15:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: ^^
[10:15:43] <gseguin> shite!
[10:15:48] <arschmitz> and that does not use vclick at all
[10:15:59] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/qudeniwo/21/edit
[10:16:00] <gseguin> Apple, fix your shit!
[10:16:13] <arschmitz> i read i think its fixed in ios8
[10:16:56] <arschmitz> gseguin: so soon it will be mostly fixed if thats true a month or 2
[10:17:11] <gseguin> where did you read that?
[10:17:26] <arschmitz> i think it was in a comment on SO
[10:18:45] <arschmitz> i dont have anything on ios8 yet to check
[10:29:53] <gseguin> arschmitz: One workaround I see is to unbind all touch events handlers on the document when entering an iframe and bind them again upon exiting the iframe
[10:30:15] <gseguin> arschmitz: do you think it's worth a try?
[10:30:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: i cant see us doing it in the lib it seems crazy to track them all
[10:31:00] <arschmitz> gseguin: but to fig your use case specificly sure
[10:31:03] <arschmitz> fix
[10:31:20] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll give it a shot
[10:31:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: let me know how it works for you
