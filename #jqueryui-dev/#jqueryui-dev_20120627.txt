[07:54:35] <kborchers_> rworth: ping
[07:54:45] <rworth> kborchers_ pong
[07:56:00] <kborchers_> so, when i'm updating these ui event props, should i be going off of what is in master or 1-8-stable. looking at accordion for example, the events listed are what's in master, not 1-8-stable
[07:56:02] <kborchers_> just want to make sure
[07:56:24] <rworth> master for master and 1-8-stable for 1-8
[07:56:40] <kborchers_> gotcha
[07:56:41] <kborchers_> thanks
[07:56:43] <rworth> np
[07:56:49] <kborchers_> from 35000 feet :)
[07:57:13] <rworth> :)
[07:57:27] * rworth hopes he has wifi on his flight
[07:57:49] <kborchers_> crossing my fingers worked for me  ;)
[10:25:28] <gnarf> kborchers: are you on a plane too?
[10:52:39] <gnarf> nacin: sorry I didn't get a chance to get online from the airport to check on things
[10:53:06] <gnarf> the lines were a little intense
[12:27:29] <kborchers> gnarf: you on a plane now?
[18:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/b1d14201e247ad60409a
[18:49:59] <gnarf> nacin: you lurking?
[18:50:28] <gnarf> we are getting an odd error message trying to deply qunitjs.com and I'm not really sure where to start tracing it, nor is scott_gonzalez
[18:50:29] <jzaefferer> getting this trying to deploy qunitjs.com to the live server:
[18:50:29] <jzaefferer> Running "wordpress-sync" task
[18:50:29] <jzaefferer> >> Error publishing example-cookbook-1-basics.html.
[18:50:29] <jzaefferer> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory /var/www/wordpress/web-base-template/blogs.dir/10/files/2012/06. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[18:50:35] <nacin> heard the ping
[18:50:48] <jzaefferer> woohoo, hello nacin
[18:51:05] <nacin> it's trying to upload a file, and via normal WP means, rather than gw-resources means
[18:51:11] <gnarf> btw, this hotel squid proxies, which totally fucks up our game :)
[18:51:24] <gnarf> but like, switch to "stage.qunitjs.com" instead of "qunitjs.com" and it works
[18:51:38] <gnarf> but richard didn't have an issue pushing jquery.com
[18:51:45] <nacin> well, one thing we can do is just create the directory and see what it uploads :-)
[18:52:15] <gnarf> maybe it has something to do with being on legacy web-base-template?
[18:52:28] <nacin> same code otherwise
[18:52:30] <gnarf> and rworth is on the plane now....
[18:52:31] <gnarf> ;)
[18:53:12] <nacin> maybe we can figure out where wp_upload_dir() is getting called
[18:53:32] <nacin> I can stick an error_log() into core to track it, if puppet doesn't overwrite me
[18:54:00] <gnarf> heh
[18:54:09] <gnarf> puppet will only overwrite wp-config
[18:54:20] <gnarf> and nginx/conf.d/vhost-autogen or whatever
[18:54:33] <gnarf> if you ever wonder if puppet will overwrite you
[18:54:39] <gnarf> puppet agent --test after making your change
[18:54:42] <gnarf> and it will yell at you
[18:54:43] <gnarf> ;)
[18:54:44] <nacin> nice
[18:54:56] <gnarf> as well as show you a diff of what it did
[18:55:00] <gnarf> afk a bit
[18:57:14] <nacin> gnarf: try the sync again?
[18:58:27] <nacin> jzaefferer: ^
[18:58:40] <jzaefferer> nacin: did you change something?
[18:58:47] <nacin> I added some logging
[18:58:49] <jzaefferer> gnarf is out for a smoke, but I can try again
[18:58:54] <jzaefferer> okay, deploying
[18:59:16] <jzaefferer> seeing something useful?
[18:59:39] <nacin> did it error yet?
[18:59:53] <jzaefferer> yeah
[19:02:29] <gnarf> nacin: when do you get here? :)
[19:02:43] <nacin> I don't, but koopersmith has my proxy :)
[19:02:51] <gnarf> awww
[19:02:56] <nacin> almost. next time for sure.
[19:03:15] <gnarf> ergo proxy?
[19:03:46] <nacin> gnarf: so the difference between stage and jq01 is
[19:03:47] <nacin> ls -la /var/www/wordpress/web-base-template/ | grep blogs.dir
[19:03:49] <jzaefferer> nacin: can I help you set things up so that you can test it yourself? Might be a lot more efficient then me deploying from here without knowing what to do with that
[19:04:04] <nacin> stage: drwxrwxr-x  8 root www-data 4096 Jun 24 14:48 blogs.dir
[19:04:12] <nacin> prod: drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Jun 27 18:52 blogs.dir
[19:04:16] <jzaefferer> also, should "blogs.dir" even be a literal value? Instead of a variable that's missing or something?
[19:04:25] <nacin> jzaefferer: sadly, yes, that's a literal value.
[19:04:28] <jzaefferer> or its just lack of write permission
[19:04:37] <nacin> lack of write permission for a directory that you guys don't need.
[19:04:46] <jzaefferer> okay, that's still odd
[19:04:48] <nacin> but if you make it writable now, it'll work, and i'll remove the dependency later.
[19:05:15] <jzaefferer> just noticed that the last attempt had a different error message
[19:05:19] <jzaefferer> very slightly different:
[19:05:20] <jzaefferer> Running "wordpress-sync" task
[19:05:20] <jzaefferer> >> Error publishing example-cookbook-1-basics.html.
[19:05:20] <jzaefferer> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: Could not write file /var/www/wordpress/web-base-template/blogs.dir/10/files/2012/06/gw-resource.html
[19:05:36] <nacin> yeah, that's cause I made things somewhat writable but not fully
[19:05:42] <jzaefferer> okay
[19:05:43] <nacin> let me just chown this thing
[19:06:18] <nacin> gnarf: what user is PHP running under?
[19:06:40] <gnarf> nacin: it should be www-data
[19:08:03] <nacin> 0770 on the directory, owned by root, group is www-data
[19:08:07] <nacin> see if it works now.
[19:08:21] <nacin> either way, you can tell the permissions and ownership are different from blogs.dir on stage to prod.
[19:08:29] <nacin> make them the same and things will work.
[19:08:42] <nacin> I'll remove the dependency in the morning.
[19:08:51] <nacin> dinner calls. I'll come back over in a bit.
[19:09:38] <jzaefferer> deploying
[19:09:53] <jzaefferer> nacin gnarf: new error
[19:09:53] <jzaefferer> Running "wordpress-sync" task

[19:09:53] <jzaefferer> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory /var/www/wordpress/gw-resources/qunitjs.com. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[19:10:05] <jzaefferer> now we're getting to some more interesting permission issue
[19:10:07] <gnarf> hrm
[19:10:26] <gnarf> nacin: roger
[19:11:03] <nacin> jzaefferer: same deal. gw-resources needs to be created and writeable by the server. this is one of those rare error messages that are verbose and accurate :-)
[19:11:16] <jzaefferer> ha, yeah
[19:11:21] <jzaefferer> Corey is on that now
[19:11:29] <jzaefferer> puppeteering even
