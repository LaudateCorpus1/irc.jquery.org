[05:39:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: Ping!
[05:45:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:45:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: When's the classes call?
[05:45:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Has it happened already?
[05:45:52] <arschmitz> no
[05:46:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: did you read the replies to your email :)?
[05:46:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, there have been some?
[05:46:24] <arschmitz> both jorn and i replied
[05:46:44] <arschmitz> he had not filled out the form so i pinged him yesterday and replied to do it without him 
[05:47:04] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: then i replied that the time you suggested worked for me if it still did everyone else
[05:47:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ohhh ha
[05:47:29] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: only replied to me
[05:47:44] <arschmitz> so when i replied it was only to him
[05:47:59] <arschmitz> im terrible at responding to group emails :(
[05:48:15] <arschmitz> i do this very very regularly forget to reply all
[05:48:33] <arschmitz> i wonder if i can make it default to that in gmail...
[05:48:38] <gabriel_schulhof> WTF?! I'm not showing any replies.
[05:48:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK :)
[05:49:04] <arschmitz> so why do i actually respond to you saying that
[05:49:49] <gabriel_schulhof> It'd be good to make it happen, because I realized two things - one mobile-specific, and one concerning the implications of making the classes option _setOption()-able.
[05:50:31] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose we can talk about the mobile-specific thing if you have a few minutes.
[05:51:00] <arschmitz> ok whats the mobile one?
[05:51:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Basically, for those widgets that have style options which we have not yet reviewed (such as listview), we should not make the style options _setOption()-able.
[05:51:27] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because then we have to provide the backcompat which adjusts the classes option whenever the style option changes.
[05:51:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... which is extra, completely useless code, especially since the style option will become deprecated.
[05:52:37] <arschmitz> ok
[05:52:53] <arschmitz> im ok with not fixing deprecated options
[05:52:59] <arschmitz> that have never worked properly
[05:53:11] <gabriel_schulhof> That's cool!
[05:53:25] <arschmitz> i mean it was not really a "bug"
[05:53:37] <arschmitz> its always worked this way and been more or less documented as such
[05:53:42] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep
[05:53:45] <arschmitz> so why fix it after its already deprecated
[05:53:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Absolutely.
[05:54:06] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Good. I'll proceed under that assumption.
[05:54:06] <arschmitz> we have looked at these like a feature not a bug meaning this would make no sense to change
[05:54:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Another thing that comes to mind.
[05:54:45] <gabriel_schulhof> As part of implementing the classes option for page and page.dialog, I want to remove the dialog widget first, so I don't have to dance around deprecated code inside page.
[05:55:04] <gabriel_schulhof> An implication of that is that custom selectmenu will break.
[05:55:22] <arschmitz> yeah cant do it
[05:55:37] <arschmitz> we dont have a way to deal with the fallback currently
[05:55:43] <arschmitz> and we dont have time 
[05:55:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I could try to switch the custom select to using a page styled as a dialog. Is that bad?
[05:55:54] <arschmitz> and honestly hoping for 1.6 to switch to ui selectmenu
[05:56:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: history
[05:56:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's the only difference. It'll be deep-linkable.
[05:56:25] <arschmitz> yeah but the deep link wont work
[05:56:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... but you can use an arbitrary URL.
[05:56:56] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: if you want to try it in a branch we can see how it works
[05:57:02] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, I could make it an internal page, and then the deep link will resolve to a non-existing document fragment, but you'll still be able to reach the page.
[05:57:05] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[05:57:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there is no way not to make it an internal page
[05:57:49] <arschmitz> what are you going to do a server call to generate a file then ajax that file in :) ?
[05:58:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, of course, in that sense.
[05:58:33] <arschmitz> so no matter what it would link to a non existent doc frag and you just get a stale url
[05:58:35] <gabriel_schulhof> But you can capture pagecontainerload and prevent default, and then pagecontainer will treat it as an external page when you eventually resolve the deferred by hand.
[05:58:38] <arschmitz> wich is KINDA bad
[05:59:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Actually, it's exactly what we do now. http://domain/path/to/page.html#&ui-state=dialog
[05:59:12] <arschmitz> yeah and its bad lol
[05:59:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's a non-existent document fragment.
[05:59:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: do you know how many issues we have with ever growing url hashes from that
[05:59:48] <arschmitz> where they just keep stacking #&ui-state=dialog
[06:03:06] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Palestinian opened issue #7732: Select Widget - Custom select (Non-native / Multiple) 02http://git.io/KNjzXQ
[06:05:29] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: They only end up stacked if you keep reloading the page on top of the open select.
[06:06:21] <arschmitz> which is really annoying
[06:06:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: thing about a page that has a login popup
[06:06:42] <arschmitz> that opens automaticly 
[06:07:05] <arschmitz> every refresh stacks the url
[06:08:34] <Omar-> hi gabriel_schulhof / arschmitz
[06:09:24] <Omar-> There is another issue (CSS) in addition to issue #7732 
[06:10:01] <Omar-> when a custom-multi-select menu is wrapped in controlgroup, .ui-select keeps expanding
[06:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Why are we having this classes option call?
[06:10:18] <Omar-> and wraps inside .ui-controlgroup-controls
[06:11:12] <Omar-> text within ".ui-select .ui-btn span" should be truncated
[06:11:21] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/5hb6Lbph/
[06:19:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: to make progress on the open issues. It looks like it has been stuck for weeks
[06:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's only "stuck" because nobody is working on it.
[06:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> Having half a dozen people talk about implementation details on a call isn't going to help.
[06:21:19] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15ottoville opened issue #7733: Wrong page after closing select menu dialog 02http://git.io/FOfziA
[06:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> I just don't see what this call is going to accomplish.
[06:23:51] <jzaefferer> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20140924.log.html#t09:15:20
[06:24:08] <jzaefferer> That's all there was
[06:24:45] <jzaefferer> I don't care about a call in particular, that was just an alternative to continue discussing on the PR
[06:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> But the only thing to discuss is what the implementation looks like.
[06:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's a terrible thing to have a call about.
[06:32:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: i just want a decision so that i can finialize the implementations in mobile and in new widgets i can even update the other widgets in ui if need be if we can just make a decision
[06:33:16] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I won't be at the meeting today, because it conflicts with CSSWG teleconference. I plan on wrapping up last 2 nits on effects rewrite this week. Nothing else to report
[06:33:49] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks mikesherov.
[06:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What decision?
[06:34:23] <arschmitz> about how classes will work with setoption
[06:34:41] <arschmitz> thats all this is about
[06:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> So you want a group discussion about what code to write, so you can write the code we discuss?
[06:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> This seems mostly backward from how everything else is implemented.
[06:35:36] <arschmitz> no
[06:36:03] <arschmitz> we started discussing if we should make it work at all or what in a meeting but never finished
[06:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> I thought that was answered weeks ago with "yes"
[06:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> You provided actual use cases. End of story.
[06:36:25] <arschmitz> no we never answered it at all
[06:36:53] <arschmitz> because it could not be abstracted you seemed against it
[06:37:06] <scott_gonzalez> So we're back to implementation details.
[06:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> Either we're discussing whether there are legit use cases or we have a decision already or there's nothing to discuss because we're not going to have a call to try to come up with use cases.
[06:37:31] <arschmitz> the question is simply should it be implemented if your now saying yes thats fine ill do it
[06:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> I said it sucked that it wasn't easy to abstract.
[06:38:28] <arschmitz> ok i missunderstood then
[06:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> And I said I didn't like some of the proposed implementations.
[06:38:29] <mikesherov> I suppose sucked != shouldn't do it
[06:38:54] <scott_gonzalez> But I remember you providing actual scenarios where this is needed.
[06:38:58] <arschmitz> yes
[06:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't see how there's anything to discuss at that point.
[06:39:14] <arschmitz> it makes controlgroup and similar widgets much saner to implement
[06:39:33] <mikesherov> so, it sucks, but it's the only way!
[06:39:48] <arschmitz> mikesherov: sadly i think so
[06:39:52] <mikesherov> so then do it :-)
[06:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> Right, if the only alternative is destroy and recreate, then there's really no discussion. We can't require hacks like that.
[06:40:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well you could use like open and close events
[06:40:19] <arschmitz> and then toggle classes directly
[06:40:23] <arschmitz> but thats super ugly
[06:40:43] <mikesherov> so, it's not the only way, just sucky but the least sucky of the options
[06:40:51] <arschmitz> mikesherov: yes
[06:40:58] <mikesherov> so then do it :-)
[06:41:05] <arschmitz> i mean its js and you have a dom there is always another way lol
[06:41:18] <arschmitz> but yeah it really gross 
[06:41:58] <arschmitz> anyway ill get to implementing

[07:31:54] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez, arschmitz, jzaefferer: If we make it possible to update any key under the classes option and have the result reflected immediately on the widget, it might be inconvenient for developers.
[07:32:11] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because they may need to parse .className-like strings and replace classes.
[07:32:21] <gabriel_schulhof> ... so that's a lot of ugly regex code.
[07:33:03] <gabriel_schulhof> I was thinking whether it may be worth providing a .addClass()/.toggleClass()/.removeClass()-like API for managing the values of keys under the classes option.
[07:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> Surely the implementation shouldn't require that.
[07:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you mean the users managing a list of classes.
[07:33:48] <scott_gonzalez> Not the widget developers.
[07:34:12] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Yes.
[07:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't add any additional API surface, it's already big.
[07:35:07] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/8fb531570b9696ecec7a
[07:35:30] <gabriel_schulhof> ^ if you want a completely generic way of replacing a class name within an existing class key.
[07:35:52] <scott_gonzalez> foo.bar already works.
[07:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's been implemented for a long time.
[07:35:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, OK. Great!
[07:36:21] <gabriel_schulhof> Still difficult to juggle class names in and out of a string.
[07:37:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Too bad the class value manipulators don't expose their inner string manipulation functions.
[07:38:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Question is, do we want to provide the convenience, or not.
[07:38:55] <arschmitz> i dont think its needed
[07:39:15] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, OK ... *shrug*
[07:39:42] <arschmitz> simple regex if you need it is not a lot to ask i dont think
[07:40:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and if you dont like regex just split the string to an array and check each one
[07:40:26] <arschmitz> its a pretty simple space delemited string
[07:41:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, I know. I'm already doing that as I'm implementing backcompat for the style options. That's where I got the idea that it's a very specific thing, core already does it, it's easy to get wrong, and it may have to be done often. After all, that's why core added the class minp functions.
[07:41:48] <gabriel_schulhof> s/minp/manip/
[07:42:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well you can still use them if you really want
[07:43:13] <arschmitz> you can get the element and use them
[07:43:20] <arschmitz> and use the value from classes
[07:43:32] <arschmitz> i wouldnt do it but there are many ways around this
[07:44:46] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, alright. I guess we'll see the reqction we get.
[08:29:53] <ldeluca> hi @arschmitz

[08:30:51] <ldeluca> I'm ldeluca@us.ibm.com
[08:31:07] <arschmitz> ldeluca: i also wanted to say thank you for all the work on the cordova/phonegap issues
[08:31:57] <ldeluca> Thanks, i'm trying to find the best place to get started
[08:32:06] <arschmitz> ldeluca: those sometimes dont get as much attention as others
[08:32:12] <arschmitz> because they are harder to test
[08:32:33] <arschmitz> ldeluca: and honestly im not a big cordova phonegap person i dont normally use it execpt to test issues
[08:32:39] <arschmitz> so your help there is awesome
[08:32:40] <ldeluca> it's definitely time consuming to reproduce :)  but that's probably the area I can help out with the most
[08:33:21] <ldeluca> Andy thought you'd be able to offer some mentoring for me on getting started with jquery-mobile.  do you know of any bugs that aren't public or some low hanging fruit that I could get started looking into?
[08:33:33] <arschmitz> ldeluca: have you ever looked at any of the grunt tools for doing phonegap / cordova builds?
[08:33:52] <arschmitz> ldeluca: absolutly anything i can do to help you get going or anything on jquery mobile im happy to do 
[08:36:06] <ldeluca> arschmitz: if you could email or comment on issues that you think would be good for me to look into that'll probably be the best way
[08:36:21] <arschmitz> ldeluca: sure ill find some

[12:43:29] <Omar-> arschmitz mind my ignorance, how can I do that?
