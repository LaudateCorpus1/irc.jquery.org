[04:25:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good point about panel default theme, I will look into it
[08:16:24] <Asmooh> huh
[08:16:34] <Asmooh> i joined jquerymobile-dev
[08:16:35] <Asmooh> -_-
[08:17:26] <Asmooh> if i have an app, i copy it to an other platoform..  how can it be that is looks crap on the other one?
[08:17:40] <Asmooh> i replaced jqm for blackberry 10 by the original one
[08:17:46] <Asmooh> also the .css
[08:20:45] <Asmooh> i can understand that stuff on android looks like crap compare to bb10
[08:20:47] <Asmooh> but like this
[08:36:50] <Asmooh> doesnt: <div id="action-bar-area" data-role="actionbar"> work in jqm on android?
[12:49:11] <uGoMobi> Asmooh: #jquery is the channel for support, also from jQuery Mobile
[12:49:51] <Asmooh> oh okay
[12:50:00] <uGoMobi> Asmooh: actionbar is not part of JQM, it was added by BB for BB10 theme
[12:50:13] <Asmooh> oohhh okay
[12:50:16] <Asmooh> i tought always :)
[12:50:35] <Asmooh> because it does work when you include it in android but now lower than 720p
[12:54:39] <Asmooh> and can i make a popup 95% width and height? for lets say i want to upload a photo but you click and then you get a popup to select the file
[13:17:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Did you get there OK?
[13:17:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[13:18:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, was ok flight
[13:18:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good to hear!
[13:18:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm working like crazy on filterable.
[13:18:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just got done with documenting pre-rendered markup.
[13:19:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on documentation?
[13:19:12] <uGoMobi> right
[13:19:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: API.
[13:19:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't have any ideas for illustrating the use of the "children" option.
[13:19:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure if we can already show the API docs with the beta release
[13:20:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's too bad.
[13:20:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Though I guess it's better to have no docs than inaccurate docs.
[13:21:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The changelog + upgrade guide + demos should substitute to some extent, I guess, because they basically cover the diffs from 1.3 rather than the whole set of features.
[13:22:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:23:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am working on those
[13:23:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ha! I just realized one thing: If you add data-enhanced="true" to a filterable, you also have to provide pre-rendered markup for whatever other widget you wanna instantiate on it (like controlgroup/collapsibleset/whatever).
[13:23:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will ask agcolom and scott_gonzalez what we can do with API docs
[13:24:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[13:24:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess you can use that analog thing, eh?
[13:24:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, to ask them.
[13:24:32] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:24:40] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:25:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's cool that you get to meet the gang ...
[13:25:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Enjoy ...
[13:25:24] <uGoMobi> yeah for sure
[13:25:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I want to go through that "JQM info and docs" doc with agcolom
[13:26:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: any idea how much API update work we still have to do?
[13:27:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you do an amazing job on that, but I know it's a lot
[13:27:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, one of the big tasks is providing a pre-rendered example for all the reviewed widgets.
[13:28:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's a big one
[13:28:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I made a relatively standard <h2> in all of the docs, but it cannot be simply copied-and-pasted, because, for each widget, you must describe the structure that is expected, and that is different for each widget.
[13:28:52] <uGoMobi> true
[13:29:15] <_|Nix|_> Then there's the whole header/footer/fixedToolbar/toolbar thing.
[13:30:07] <_|Nix|_> All the previous toolbar-related entries must be marked as deprecated, and they must all point to the toolbar entry, which documents all the options on one page, while mentioning, for each of the options, which extension provides it.
[13:30:30] <_|Nix|_> Same goes for dialog. A deprecation note and a link to page must be adde.d
[13:30:53] <_|Nix|_> Then there's the job of going over all the options of all the widgets and marking them as deprecated.
[13:31:28] <_|Nix|_> So, there's widget-specific work, and then there're passes that need to be made over all API entries.
[13:32:19] <uGoMobi> yeah, especially the deprecated notes are important
[13:32:44] <_|Nix|_> One cool thing we could do for a widget is have a list of checkboxes at the top of the page - one for each extension - which controls whether the stuff related to that extension is shown.
[13:32:50] <uGoMobi> if we don't add them before final we didn't deprecate and have to keep the feature another version
[13:33:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I know.
[13:33:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm kinda hoping that beta will be stable enough so you guys can also spend some time on the API docs.
[13:33:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah me too
[13:33:48] * _|Nix|_ feels so small
[13:33:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and we also have to get the new web site in shape
[13:34:05] <uGoMobi> and the ThemeRoller update
[13:34:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's almost like getting the 1.4.0 features into the library was the icing on the cake :)
[13:34:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know :)
[13:35:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for all those things goes... let's make sure everything is at acceptable level so we can release and switch to new web site
[13:35:51] <uGoMobi> improvements can be made later
[13:36:17] <_|Nix|_> For sure.
[13:36:31] <_|Nix|_> Get this thing out the door!
[13:37:00] <uGoMobi> yes please :D
