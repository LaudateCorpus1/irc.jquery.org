[05:08:16] <DarsVaeda> hi, not sure if found a bug in droppable, is anyone active?
[05:12:17] <DarsVaeda> see this example: http://jsbin.com/adeciw/2/edit#preview
[05:12:17] <DarsVaeda> if you drag something (ie. "meeting notes") onto "Flash" it returns "2"
[05:12:17] <DarsVaeda> it should return "3" as this is the id of "Flash", but it only returns the id of the parent
[05:12:17] <DarsVaeda> I went to the code of droppable and if I dump "this" after line 114 (current version), this is actually the child element with id "3" but there I am stuck, cause I do not know where that is overwritten
[06:07:43] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yt?
[06:16:15] <kborchers> ?tell jzaefferer i will be in a meeting all morning and may only be able to lurk during the UI meeting. i will try to have IRC open on my ipad during my meeting so if you have any questions about Menu status for the meeting, i will try to answer them and try to chime in during the meeting
[06:16:15] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[10:10:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: Any input on todo #3 when you have some time would be appreciated
[10:10:31] <kborchers> On menu
[10:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how I feel about requiring the anchor tag
[10:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> but it looks good
[10:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> maybe if we add an items option we can get away from requiring an anchor
[10:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> and that would probably give us support for tables
[10:16:02] <kborchers> Hmmm, the option could help with me having specific classes too, though tables could still be an issue when you get into tbody
[10:17:50] <kborchers> I noticed chrome adding a tbody too even if i dont specify one
[10:19:51] <kborchers> I'll play around with an option though, i was just trying to avoid as we usually dont want to add options if we dont hve to right?
[10:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, but we generally have an items option if the widget is a collection of many items
[10:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> like sortable, selectable
[10:20:47] <kborchers> True, ok thanks!
