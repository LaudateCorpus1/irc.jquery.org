[03:36:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6461 - are we gonna have the new selectmenu in 1.5?
[03:37:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... otherwise I need to make the modification I describe in the comments and submit a PR.
[03:38:09] <doesallmagic2> Project download.jqueryui.com build #237: STILL FAILING in 4.5 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/download.jqueryui.com/237/
[03:38:34] <jzaefferer> wohoo, a IRC notification from Jenkins
[03:41:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we planned adoption of UI's new selectmenu widget for 1.5 if it was ready, which is the case 
[03:42:35] <doesallmagic2> Yippee, build fixed!
[03:42:35] <doesallmagic2> Project download.jqueryui.com build #238: FIXED in 3 min 40 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/download.jqueryui.com/238/
[03:43:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not completely sure how we should handle deprecation of the current selectmenu widget
[03:43:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we can't have both with the same name
[03:44:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, we can implement the current selectmenu API with the new selectmenu. Then we don't need to deprecate anything.
[03:44:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, either way it doesn't look like we'll be building listviews out of select options anymore.
[03:45:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still, we need to implement our placeholder semantics, so that issue may still be relevant.
[03:45:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we won't have native menu anymore
[03:45:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is about non-native.
[03:46:20] <_|Nix|_> We consider <option value="">ABC</option> to be a placeholder, but we shouldn't.
[03:46:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup, but that was about not having to deprecate anything
[03:46:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see.
[03:46:32] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[03:46:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz also have been working on things for selectmenu
[03:47:00] <_|Nix|_> I guess data-native-menu will become meaningless ...
[03:47:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: before we work on anything other than 1.4.x bug fixes for selectmenu we should first discuss our plans for this widget
[03:47:34] <jqcommit> [13jquery-color] 15jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/M75y8Q
[03:47:34] <jqcommit> 13jquery-color/06master 14c481c66 15JoÌˆrn Zaefferer: Tests: Fix mixed tabs/spaces jshint warning
[03:47:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, agreed. I brought this up because the milestone is 1.5.0.
[03:48:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, on our roadmap we have the selectmenu widget review for 1.5 in case the new selectmenu widget wouldn't be ready
[03:48:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Alternatively, we could fix this issue in 1.4.x, close it, and then we proceed with 1.5.0.
[03:49:13] <jzaefferer> My two cents on that: Focus on integrating the new selectmenu and don't spend more time on the old one
[03:49:38] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: yeah, agreed
[03:49:59] <_|Nix|_> I'm not so sure ... 1.5.0 may be a while yet, during which time we have to support 1.4.3.
[03:50:04] <_|Nix|_> Or, rather, 1.4.x.
[03:50:24] <_|Nix|_> Not that we should be spending too much time on it - agreed, but this is a fairly small change.
[03:50:46] <_|Nix|_> ... and fairly easy to test.
[03:51:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but it won't land in 1.4.3 and we already discussed that we want to focus on 1.5 development from now on
[03:55:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Forget it then. The workaround is described in the issue.
[03:56:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, there is a workaround and with the new widget comming up this is a very low priority one
[03:57:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: even if it's small change, it still requires writing a test, reviewing the PR etc. so it always costs time
[03:58:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think it would be great if we can start with the listview widget review
[03:58:51] <uGoMobi> starting with a ticket like we did for the navbar review
[04:04:35] <fnagel> uGoMobi _|Nix|_: It's planned to drop native menu support in mobile selectmenu?
[04:05:41] <uGoMobi> fnagel: it's is planned to use the same widget as UI
[04:06:13] <uGoMobi> fnagel: which doesn't support native menus, right?
[04:06:35] <fnagel> and FYI: I've tried to implement native menu in (an older version) selectmenu but it's a mess (a11y, callback events, etc.), see here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/selectmenu-native-menu
[04:06:58] <uGoMobi> fnagel: yeah, I remember that
[04:07:40] <fnagel> uGoMobi: I'm aware of that but I'm not sure how to explain people we do not have a native menu support for best usability on mobile devices
[04:07:54] <fnagel> The selectmenu-native-menu does but the one in master does not

[10:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> I should've filed that.
[10:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> Let's do it retroactively.
[10:08:11] <kborchers> wasn't that before menu was released? we didn't have tickets for a widget that didn't exist at the time
[10:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> Menu has existed for a while.
[10:10:30] <kborchers> it was released in 1.9 in october and that commit is from september
[10:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> Wrong year.
[10:11:26] <kborchers> doh ... i'm an idiot
