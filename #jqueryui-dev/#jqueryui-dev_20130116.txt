[05:39:21] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: btw, I don't know if you were following the conversation petro, gnarf and I had last night
[05:39:30] <mikesherov> clip supports percentages
[05:40:25] <mikesherov> so our parse should support that too, and it will probably fulfill your desire to do calculations "inside"
[05:41:41] <mikesherov> also, we're going to want to support partial objects for cssClip and the stepHook
[05:42:17] <mikesherov> i.e. if you only provide top and left, the hooks should fill in the right and bottom
[05:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I saw all that.
[05:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> Is there logic we can leverage from core to make that stuff work without doing all the calculations on our own?
[05:43:09] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: not really
[05:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[05:43:18] <mikesherov> not if we're supporting back to 1.6
[05:43:23] <mikesherov> or even 1.7
[05:43:28] <mikesherov> I'll look to make sure
[05:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's see what's available in 1.9 and if there's something that could be added, let's add it :-)
[05:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> That way in 5 years we can use it.
[05:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? http://cl.ly/image/0i1s0U3R450t
[06:02:03] <tj_vantoll> Wow, that's special.
[06:04:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wat? :(
[06:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> The best part is that's the most popular article on my blog.
[06:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's such a common problem.
[06:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> 2k views/month
[06:07:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: at least you're getting the attention you're seeking
[06:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA. 18k views of that article in September.
[06:09:00] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #157: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/157/
[06:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> 20k in August.
[06:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> What is going on?
[06:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> 20k in July.
[06:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> When did so many people start reading this?
[06:10:21] <kborchers> üé∂ You're soooo vain. You prob'ly think this song is about you ‚Ä¶ üé∂
[06:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:10:48] <tj_vantoll> :)
[06:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna keep tracing this back, because I know the traffic is normally way lower.
[06:11:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: probably just a failed DOS attack :P
[06:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> heh, no, I get way more traffic on some stock scam that some bots constantly run on my site :-)
[06:12:50] <kborchers> :)
[06:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, something happened in October 2011: http://cl.ly/image/0o3z0e1W0T3a
[06:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> That's all legit traffic, no stock scam in that month :-P
[06:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> Then the traffic stays at that height.
[06:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, kborchers, here's one of the months with the stock requests: http://cl.ly/image/0A3T0R0T3v2g
[06:15:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nice :D
[06:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> The requests go to /asp/stocks/trade/ordertbl.asp
[06:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> It happens every few months.
[06:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> So it was exactly 1 year of higher traffic.
[06:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> Very strange.
[06:16:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oct 2011 - Oct 2012
[06:19:09] <gnarf> kborchers: http://stackoverflow.com/q/14146583/91914
[06:21:15] <kborchers> gnarf: looking
[06:27:20] <kborchers> gnarf: i remember tables not working because we can't control what the browsers do (adding in tbody, etc.) so we couldn't predict the structure. that is probably the issue
[06:27:35] <kborchers> we should probably document that
[06:27:52] <kborchers> or find a way to fix it but i worked on it a while and didn't find a solution :/
[06:30:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do you remember that? ^^
[06:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> The question is do I remember where *my* code is.
[06:32:08] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-examples/blob/master/autocomplete/table-display.html
[06:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Heh: "this example isn't intended to work right now, it's purely a reference for improving the menu widget."
[06:39:55] <kborchers> gnarf: also, regarding your response, menu should work well with anything other than tables, not just ul/li  see the last couple of examples on http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html

[17:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> whew, finally made it through the dialog portion of the upgrade guide.
[17:43:06] <gnarf> 80% of the way done? :)
[17:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh, not quite, but close.
[17:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> 90% of what's left is "We removed X"
[17:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> So it's easier to write.
[17:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> Deprecation and new features are harder to document.
[18:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> down to spinner, tabs, and widget...
[18:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs is pretty big.
[18:42:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is this normal in Opera? http://cl.ly/image/241R1d133y0v
[18:42:38] <kborchers> happens with 1.8.3 too so ...
[18:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I don't think that's normal. Maybe new Opera?
[18:43:06] <kborchers> maybe
[18:43:16] <kborchers> 12.12
[18:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> I've got 12.12 as well.
[18:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> Let me run a test.
[18:43:41] <kborchers> ok
[18:44:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: it's only when i run all i think
[18:44:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm testing that now.
[18:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's happening for me too.
[18:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't worry about it.
[18:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's certainly not an issue with our real code.
[18:46:25] <kborchers> ok, sounds good. should i file a bug for it or anything so we look into it later?
[18:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[18:47:21] <kborchers> ok
[18:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> Just file and set the milestone to git
[18:48:04] <kborchers> ok
[18:50:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: component? ui.dev?
[18:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> dev or test
[18:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we don't have test anymore.
[18:57:20] <kborchers> right, i went with dev
[18:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[18:59:48] <kborchers> uh oh, same failure in FF scott_gonzalez :/
[19:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> werid
[19:00:55] <scott_gonzalez> Something must've changed with QUnit recently.
[19:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> The all test doesn't get run too often.
[19:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> So it could've been a while back.
[19:02:03] <kborchers> just updated FF and it worked
[19:02:09] <kborchers> running again to make sure
[19:03:19] <kborchers> wtf, now i'm getting weird failures all over the place ‚Ä¶ clearing cache and trying again
[19:04:44] <kborchers> this is really weird
[19:05:10] <kborchers> if i clear the cache, the tests run through but i get that global error
[19:05:31] <kborchers> then if i rerun the tests, i get some autocomplete failures and it hangs on the button tests
[19:05:54] <kborchers> sorry, not autocomplete, accordion
[19:06:29] <kborchers> running any of them individually works fine though it seems. so yeah, must be an issue with all
[19:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> What if you run the test suite directly?
[19:06:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[19:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just consider it all good.
[19:06:59] <kborchers> ok
[19:34:44] <kborchers> i hate focus
[19:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> focus is overrated
[19:35:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: should i be concerned that http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/core/core.html?testNumber=3 fails randomly on IE8 via browserstack?
[19:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R2FyIGxWYI
[19:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> perhaps?
[19:35:37] <kborchers> not if you run it by itself though
[19:35:48] <kborchers> only as part of the full core suite
[19:35:55] <kborchers> or all
[19:36:05] <kborchers> but run it alone and i can't get it to fail
[19:36:08] <kborchers> :/
[19:37:36] <kborchers> also annoyed that i upgraded to Java 7 and now i can't use the browserstack tunnel with chrome
[19:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't worry about the focus test.
[19:38:26] <kborchers> ok
[20:13:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looks like sizzle doesn't like jquery-ui/tests/visual/dialog/performance.html
[20:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[20:14:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/3E1a3s1s1C2W
[20:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[20:14:51] <kborchers> :)
[20:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> $.trim( $( "#template" ).html() ) on line 19
[20:16:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: fixed :)
[20:19:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do you want to see a separate commit for that or just include it in my 1.9 upgrade commit?
[20:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> You can just include it.
[20:19:56] <kborchers> ok
[20:45:51] <kborchers> so much testing ‚Ä¶.
[20:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[20:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> I think you're probably good.
[20:46:43] <kborchers> i should probably test at least one IE
[21:36:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: still around?
[21:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[21:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> BANGING AWAY ON THE PLUGINS SITE!
[21:37:01] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so testing IE isn't going well (only because browserstack isn't working for me right now) so decided to do the dry run
[21:37:15] <kborchers> before i do this, all i have to do is change that repo var before running right?
[21:37:28] <kborchers> i changed it to a new repo i created in my account
[21:37:41] <kborchers> that should do it right so i don't screw everything up?
[21:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, change that and you'll need one more thing just to get it to run.
[21:38:56] <scott_gonzalez> Search for 1.10.0
[21:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> There should be some code that's going to abort the release.
[21:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> Comment out the check and after prevVersion is set, just hardcode it to 1.9.2.
[21:43:20] * kborchers says a little prayer before running the script :)
[21:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[21:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> There will be plenty of time to bail if it's wrong.
[21:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> It'll dump out a ton of information, and you'll be able to see the repo it's using.
[21:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> It'll stop and ask you if you want to continue before it does anything with GitHub.
[21:45:36] <kborchers> ok
[21:45:40] <kborchers> doing it now
[21:50:08] <kborchers> oops, i forgot a step :)
[21:50:11] <kborchers> just a min
[21:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...where's the 1.9.0 commit?
[21:51:31] <kborchers> haven't pushed that yet because i haven't been able to test IE
[21:51:44] <kborchers> visual tests i mean
[21:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> They're probably fine :-)
[21:51:56] <kborchers> heh
[21:52:01] <kborchers> ok just a min
[21:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Do you know if you're in a room by yourself for the Toronto conf?
[22:00:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i honestly have no idea ‚Ä¶ i assumed i would be as a speaker but haven't heard any details
[22:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> If you're in a room by yourself with two beds, I'm coming up and staying with you :-)
[22:01:05] <kborchers> heh, ok
[22:01:18] <kborchers> i'll let you know when i find out
[22:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> After you do the dry run, send me the changelog that it generates.
[22:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> That way I can get a head start on formatting it.
[22:02:40] <kborchers> i have a mess :(
[22:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[22:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> What's going on?
[22:04:17] <kborchers> i swore i updated master before i made the 1.9 changes ‚Ä¶ then i saw it wasn't so tried to rebase and got conflicts. i aborted the rebase and now i have files that git thinks are modified, but the contents are equal and i can't do the rebase again because there are "modified" files :/
[22:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[22:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase --abort?
[22:05:31] <kborchers> that's what i did
[22:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like this happened to me the other week.
[22:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember what I was doing or how/if I resolved it.
[22:06:10] <kborchers> i wonder if i can git reset --hard HEAD ?
[22:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> If that's the commit you want, it should work.
[22:08:03] <kborchers> uh oh, brb i am running on "reserve power"
[22:10:22] <kborchers> wat?
[22:10:34] <kborchers> after hard reset still thinks those files have been modified
[22:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[22:15:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: looks like maybe some weird line-ending thing?
[22:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..that should be resolved.
[22:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commits/master/.gitattributes
[22:18:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i don't have that commit from jzaefferer 
[22:18:02] <kborchers> :)
[22:18:10] <kborchers> that is part of the rebase that failed
[22:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> So you were a few commits behind when you started the 1.9.0 update?
[22:19:12] <kborchers> yeah, i thought i updated before i started but i guess not :(  i think i reset but didn't fetch first so it didn't actually bring me up to date
[22:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you can probably redo the 1.9.0 update faster than you can get this resolved :-P
[22:19:47] <kborchers> yeah
[22:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> You won't need to do the testing again.
[22:19:53] <kborchers> was just thinking that
[22:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> Basically load one or two things and make sure it seems good.
[22:20:12] <kborchers> ok
[22:29:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, go ahead and push to master?
[22:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[22:42:48] <kborchers> Error getting git log.
[22:42:49] <kborchers> Aborting.
[22:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Did you remember to do the prevVersion = "1.9.2"?
[22:43:21] <kborchers> yep
[22:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[22:43:38] <kborchers> it said moving from 1.9.2 to 1.10.0
[22:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> Does your repo have both of those tags?
[22:43:56] <kborchers> ah, nope
[22:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> Which one is missing?
[22:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is that just a problem from your fork?
[22:44:30] <kborchers> yep
[22:44:45] <kborchers> i didn't push the tags to the fork
[22:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> I've done that a few times :-P
[22:45:14] <kborchers> should i just kill it and start over with the 1.9.2 tag there?
[22:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[22:45:21] <kborchers> ok
[22:57:07] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, dry run is running again 
[23:01:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui-test and check e-mail for changelog
[23:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[23:03:02] <kborchers> cool
[23:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> Can you check to make sure the themes are using the latest code?
[23:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> Should be easy to tell. If they're formatted nicely they're new :-)
[23:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if gmail is being dumb or what, but this attachment is stalled :-/
[23:04:19] <kborchers> hmmm
[23:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> Can you gist it?
[23:04:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you mean these themes? https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui-test/blob/master/themes/base/jquery.ui.menu.css
[23:04:50] <kborchers> oh
[23:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> The named themes.
[23:05:14] <kborchers> right
[23:05:17] <kborchers> just a min
[23:05:23] <kborchers> i'll gist that changelog too
[23:05:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/4554262
[23:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[23:08:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: the themes look clean ‚Ä¶ properly indented. is that what you mean?
[23:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[23:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> I guess you can also check by seeing if jquery.ui.dialog.css is using fixed positioning.
[23:08:59] <kborchers> ok, checking
[23:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, first flexbox ticket just came in.
[23:10:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nope, absolute
[23:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, it's not in the dialog CSS.
[23:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's in core CSS.
[23:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> for the overlay
[23:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> Dialog is the only thing that uses it though :-P
[23:11:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: .ui-widget-overlay is fixed
[23:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[23:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like we'll be releasing tomorrow
[23:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> err....later today...
[23:12:42] <kborchers> :)
[23:13:11] <kborchers> ok, don't know about you but i am going to bed because i'm sure my son will be up in about 4 maybe 5 hours if i'm lucky
