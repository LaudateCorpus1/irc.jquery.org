[05:07:54] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im not sure if this is related to the issue you asked us the other day. But, github buttons that have tooltip dont close them on click https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/967155/7390469/0751d760-ee4f-11e4-94fd-48457816ae57.gif
[05:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's related. Though they don't show tooltips on focus.
[05:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's the focus handling that the complaint is about.
[05:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> Because the element stays focused after the click, so it's still focused when you come back to the page.
[05:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> The interaction he cares about is actually switching to the new window, moving your mouse, then switching back.
[05:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> On GitHub the tooltip will be gone since you're no longer hovering.
[05:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> But it's definitely a good data point to show that it doesn't close on click as he requested.
[05:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add a note about that in the ticket.
[05:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[05:55:22] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ah gotcha thanks
