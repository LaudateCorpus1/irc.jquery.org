[15:35:43] <clarkbox> how would one implement a divider/separator using menu()?
[15:36:17] <clarkbox> just some HTML in the <li>?
[15:46:01] <FrEaKmAn_> hi all.. I'm testing autocomplete plugin
[15:46:25] <FrEaKmAn_> is it possible to define #id where items are listed?
[16:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> FrEaKmAn_: Use #jquery for support.
[16:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: Probably something like <li><hr></li>
[16:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: It might be worth adding specific support for dividers
[16:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll probably get around to actually looking at menu in a few weeks :-P
[16:43:21] <clarkbox> actually an <HR/>  pretty well
[16:43:43] <clarkbox> there is no explicit js code or css...
[16:44:03] <clarkbox> but because its not a <A> tag everything works pretty well
[16:45:15] <clarkbox> *actually an <hr/> *works* pretty well
