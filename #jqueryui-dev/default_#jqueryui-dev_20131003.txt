[01:11:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[01:11:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[01:11:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6551 ... where exactly should I document that?
[01:11:32] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6551 by salamanders (14h 19m ago): Class vs data-role conversion for buttons - potential user confusion
[01:11:35] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[01:11:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[01:12:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I added a deprecation notice to buttonMarkup(). Should I write it there?
[01:12:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can elaborate with an example, and I can even show how data-* attributes that are not related to style must remain in place.
[01:13:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we have to make it clear at several places... API docs, demos and upgrade guide
[01:13:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, but which API doc? buttonMarkup?
[01:13:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, good to mention it there
[01:13:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thing is we didn't have buttonMarkup in API docs for 1.3
[01:13:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then I will be very detailed. I will show before/after scenarios etc.
[01:14:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, I suspect that we cannot simply do away with it.
[01:14:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean?
[01:15:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think demos are good as they are now http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/button-markup/
[01:15:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but maybe add a note there as well
[01:15:41] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15frequent opened issue #6552: feature request: popup - allow parameters to be settable on the triggering link  02http://git.io/Ok00bw
[01:15:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean that we cannot remove buttonMarkup without a deprecation period even though it's not technically documented, because I suspect people know about it and have been using it.
[01:16:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we deprecate in 1.4 but we can remove it in 1.5
[01:16:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Agreed. So, I'll add some more commentary to entries/buttonMarkup.xml ...
[01:16:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but since we will deprecate style options in widgets in 1.5 and remove in 1.6 we could wait with removing buttonMarkup until 1.6 as well
[01:19:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For sure, as long as we deprecate now (which we've already done).

[02:16:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I did
[02:16:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It tells me to submit tomorrow after 5:05 (presumably Eastern).
[02:16:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually had an email conversation with Expensify about that
[02:17:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, did you just wait and submit later?
[02:17:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's st00pid, because it tells me the USD value right there.
[02:17:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let me check what they answered
[02:17:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I was thinking exactly the same
[02:17:44] <uGoMobi> so I emailed them
[02:19:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you have to submit the report tomorrow
[02:19:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it has to do with them using a third party currency verify-er
[02:20:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll do it tomorrow. Thanks!

[02:42:30] <uGoMobi> ?
[02:42:48] <_|Nix|_> No, I didn't notice that.
[02:43:13] <uGoMobi> maybe it's only on Chrome
[02:43:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you on FF?
[02:43:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, FF here. Lemme check Chrome.
[02:43:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's not an API docs issue, but a framework issue
[02:44:05] <uGoMobi> I see it in the demos and JS Bins as well

[03:24:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just moved the mouse poitner back-and-forth over a View Source button in Chrome, and I can't see any difference.
[03:25:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it doesn't happen all the time but I do see the problem very often
[03:25:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, don't get me started on Chrome rendering issues ...
[03:26:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: after the page is loaded I see a serif font and only when I hover a button I get to see the sans-serif font
[03:26:30] <_|Nix|_> Wow! That's bad!
[03:26:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But look at http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/listview-collapsible-item-indented/ with Chrome
[03:27:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the inset listview, the first item ("Birds") has a white 1px strip at the bottom.
[03:27:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I know what you mean
[03:27:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not so in FF.
[03:27:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see it now, but probably depends on window size
[03:27:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah :(
[03:27:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, it as Chrome bug
[03:28:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it only seems to happen when you use em values for top and bottom padding
[03:28:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, in FF, if you scroll the page, the icons like (+) and (>) move up and down wrt. the list item delimiters.
[03:28:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, probably because of rounding errors.
[03:28:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[03:29:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the bug is reported and I commented to confirm the issue
[03:29:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which bug? Chrome?
[03:29:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, the Chrome bug
[03:29:55] <uGoMobi> looking on FF now
[03:30:37] <uGoMobi> hmm I don't see the issue

[03:41:22] <uGoMobi> I see it there
[03:41:35] <uGoMobi> zooming in now on FF to see if I can reproduce
[03:43:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I still don't see it on FF 24, OS X and Windows 7
[03:44:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: *sigh* ... Must be a linux thing.
[03:46:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe

[03:52:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Funny thing is Chrome may have the same problem, but you won't notice because it doesn't scroll smoothly.

[06:19:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: Morning
[06:19:20] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:20:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i figured out what is going on with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6500
[06:20:29] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6500 by googol7 (1w 3d ago): iOS 7 homescreen app redirects to other page when widget gets input focus
[06:20:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: tell me
[06:20:52] <arschmitz> the select menu opens on focus
[06:21:12] <arschmitz> so what happens is you touch the menu it gets focus and opens which pushes the toolbar up
[06:21:21] <arschmitz> to the exact same spot the select was
[06:21:27] <arschmitz> and then the click happens
[06:21:32] <arschmitz> but now the toolbar is there
[06:22:28] <uGoMobi> ahh
[06:23:16] <arschmitz> this isnt new either
[06:23:37] <arschmitz> its just you have to have a page where everything just happens to perfectly align 
[06:23:44] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:24:00] <uGoMobi> that's why I could reproduce with one input but not with another
[06:24:08] <arschmitz> probably
[06:24:10] <uGoMobi> select I mean
[06:24:31] <arschmitz> im not really sure what we can do about it though
[06:24:41] <arschmitz> we are not doing any event binding here this is all native
[06:25:21] <uGoMobi> yes, no vclick stuff
[06:25:38] <arschmitz> we dont even bind to click or focus to make this happen
[06:25:53] <arschmitz> when you tap your tapping directly on the native select
[06:26:17] <uGoMobi> will probably also happen without JQM
[06:26:23] <arschmitz> oh it will for sure
[06:26:35] <arschmitz> you just need a page with everything perfectly positioned
[06:26:36] <uGoMobi> if you put the select on the "right" spot and a link in your header
[06:26:43] <uGoMobi> yup
[06:27:23] <arschmitz> yeah i dont like it but im tempted to close cant fix 
[06:28:08] <arschmitz> wish ios and mobile browsers in general would inforce having related events trigger on the same target

[07:19:06] <toddmparker> morning. man, i feel like i've been lost at sea the last month. getting back to some normalness
[07:19:58] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[07:20:03] <uGoMobi> welcome back :)
[07:20:29] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[07:20:44] <toddmparker> i've been traveling for the last 3 week, then got sick (of course)
[07:20:54] <uGoMobi> aii
[07:21:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hope you feel better now
[07:21:09] <toddmparker> anyway, i was going to try and carve out a bit of time to look at visual stuff if you still need my eyes
[07:21:18] <toddmparker> fine now, yep
[07:21:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, that would be great
[07:22:27] <toddmparker> man, iOS7 really messed up bottom toolbars. That area is used to open the browser chrome now.
[07:22:58] <toddmparker> so i was just looking at: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/theme-default/
[07:23:26] <toddmparker> is the plan to ship with just a single swatch or a light/dark?
[07:23:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: A and B, light and dark
[07:23:56] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[07:24:28] <toddmparker> is there a better theme overview page that shows the dark one too? just wan to be looking at the most up-to-date one
[07:25:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: it is the up to date one, it loads from CSS/themes/ folder
[07:25:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: at the top of the page you can select theme A and B
[07:26:29] <toddmparker> Ah!
[07:26:32] <toddmparker> cool
[07:27:05] <toddmparker> each swatch can have a unique active now too, right
[07:27:46] <toddmparker> so you have a fresh jsbin template that links to all the latest hotness? I might want to copy this over and try a few things
[07:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: We need you to sign the CAA.

[07:32:51] <toddmparker> cool. that helped. cooking with gas now. here is that page with a different blue we might want to try: http://jsbin.com/UDekuWI/4/edit
[07:34:53] <toddmparker> pop, got the text shadow too. Wonder if we should use RGBA for shadows to avoid needing to calc those? Guess that would have TR impact. http://jsbin.com/UDekuWI/5/edit
[07:35:09] <toddmparker> rgba(0,0,0,.25) would sure be easier
[07:36:13] <uGoMobi> oh I like that blue
[07:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Please sign the CAA.
[07:39:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i really like how vibrant the on state is on B but muting it a bit might be nice - http://jsbin.com/UDekuWI/6/edit
[07:40:06] <toddmparker> i also set the border and bg color the same so it's super flat
[07:40:10] <toddmparker> (on B)
[07:41:01] <uGoMobi> yeah, still bright be bit more pleasant for the eyes
[07:42:05] <toddmparker> really like how clean these themes are, nice work
[07:42:35] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:42:49] <uGoMobi> I think the bars need a bit more contrast
[07:43:12] <uGoMobi> specially when used as divider it is hard to see the difference between list buttons and the dividers
[07:43:48] <toddmparker> true
[07:45:12] <uGoMobi> how about removing text shadow all together?
[07:48:49] <toddmparker> might be a good idea. Sometimes a tiny bit cleans up rendering, but worth trying
[07:49:16] <toddmparker> This has more contrast bars for both swatches. I tried a bit lighter for B - http://jsbin.com/UDekuWI/7/edit
[07:51:00] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: do you know why the reveal and push panel shadows seem to be off? 
[07:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Can you please acknowledge me?
[07:51:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: reveal yes, push no... will take a look now
[07:51:52] <toddmparker> hey scott_gonzalez! 
[07:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> Can you please sign the CAA?

[07:53:21] <toddmparker> np
[07:53:30] <toddmparker> how goes?
[07:54:47] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I'm too busy to be productive :-(
[07:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> Currently working on copyright audits.
[07:57:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we apply inset shadow to the reveal panel, that's why it's not on top of the listview
[07:57:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we can't apply the shadow to the wrapper because of fixed toolbars outside the wrapper
[07:57:44] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/panel-styling/
[07:59:30] <uGoMobi> if you know the height of your header you can make it work with fixed toolbars http://jsbin.com/upirol/87/edit
[07:59:52] <uGoMobi> push panels don't get shadow... we add a 1px border
[08:00:21] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[08:00:39] <toddmparker> i need to hop into a meeting for a bit but will pick this up later this afternoon when i'm out. 
[08:01:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok thanks
[08:25:47] <arschmitz>  uGoMobi: that ios7 popup issue can reproduced in chrome
[08:25:55] <arschmitz> but its because he has invalid markup
[08:26:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that's good to know.
[08:26:34] <arschmitz> well the first part anyway
[08:26:51] <arschmitz> i dont know about the 15 px thing and the zoom
[08:27:02] <arschmitz> but the positioning is because of crazy markup
[08:27:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I only saw data-position-to="origin"... missed the second (incorrect) position data- attr
[08:27:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah he was complaining it would not position to window
[08:28:43] <uGoMobi> ok I now see that after an orientation change the link is not visible
[08:28:56] <uGoMobi> looks like the page is scrolled a bit
[08:29:07] <arschmitz> which is normal
[08:31:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: i just double checked and with correct markup i cannot reproduce any of the issues
[08:32:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats the same guy as with the is there any way to make it faster dups
[08:33:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and the same guy with the old surface tablet sends requests to the server from selects 
[08:33:53] <arschmitz> so far he does not have a good track record 
[08:34:51] <uGoMobi> yeah

[08:46:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't test on iOS 6 before
[08:46:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could it be a iPod performance issue?
[08:46:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i reproduced on my phone
[08:47:01] <arschmitz> dont remember if it was on new phone or old phone though
[08:47:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: iPhone 4?
[08:47:08] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[08:47:12] <uGoMobi> iOS 6 or 7?
[08:47:19] <arschmitz> one of the :)
[08:47:52] <arschmitz> it was either ios6 iphone4 or ios7 iphone5s i dont remember
[08:48:00] <arschmitz> i want to say it was 6/4
[08:50:10] <uGoMobi> ok I removed the unconfirmed label, but also the 1.4 milestone
[08:50:27] <uGoMobi> if we have time we can look into it
[08:50:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah it was by no means a showstopper
[08:50:55] <arschmitz> just a minior flicker
[08:51:09] <arschmitz> oh and i remember now it was iphone4 ios6 for sure
[08:51:36] <arschmitz> because i did it on new one and thought it "might" still be happening but it was to fast to be able to tell
[08:51:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:52:02] <uGoMobi> I only see smooth transition
[08:52:13] <arschmitz> cool
[08:52:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if i recall _|Nix|_ said after he thought it might be something with the docs 
[08:52:50] <arschmitz> not sure if he tried jsbin and it didnt happen or what though
[08:53:18] <uGoMobi> something we can test later
[08:53:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
