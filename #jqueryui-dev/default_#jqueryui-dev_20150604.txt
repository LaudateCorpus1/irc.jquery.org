[10:40:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: few things
[10:41:01] <arschmitz> you have some prs that have just been waiting to get merged
[10:41:19] <arschmitz> i also updated my PR
[10:43:00] <gabriel_schulhof> Cool!
[10:43:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll merge that unified demo PR.
[10:46:56] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: gabriel_schulhof : in 1.5-dev all the controlgroup buttons get the ui-corner-all class
[10:47:05] <jasperdegroot> is that still work in progress?
[10:47:18] <jasperdegroot> see http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-dev/demos/controlgroup/
[10:47:39] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: thats deffinitly broken

[10:48:09] <arschmitz> and its fixed by https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8141
[10:48:17] <arschmitz> i think thats the same thing i mentioned to you earlier
[10:48:21] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok cool
[10:48:28] <jasperdegroot> wasn't sure if that's what you meant

[12:01:49] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: oh man this rebase with master is really really not good
[12:02:01] <arschmitz> we are 96 commits ahead now
[12:02:37] <arschmitz> and because of the esformatter and demos commits one 1.5-dev all this prs we landed on master are just HORRIBLE!!!!
[12:03:13] <arschmitz> i REALLY REALLY Should have rebased and landed them on 1.5-dev and had you do the same with yours
[12:08:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We might just have to apply the changes on master by hand.
[12:08:37] <arschmitz> ill take care of it
[12:08:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Like, look at what you've done on master and do it again on 1.5-dev.
[12:08:50] <arschmitz> but ill tell you a merge commit is tempting lol
[12:09:17] <arschmitz> i tried it just for curiosity and its so simple to fix the confilicts there
[12:09:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, definitely, because otherwise you have to work your way through the same conflict over and over :/
[12:09:37] <arschmitz> well a lot of the conflicts dont even happen
[12:09:41] <gabriel_schulhof> Exactly.
[12:09:42] <arschmitz> because the logic is different
[12:09:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, a subsequent commit removes a conflict.
[12:10:11] <gabriel_schulhof> merging is as if you had squashed everything into a single commit and then rebased.
[12:10:18] <arschmitz> yup
[12:10:32] <arschmitz> like all the esformatter conflicts dont happen
[12:10:39] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: TBH, I don't think it'll totally kill our history readability to merge.
[12:10:55] <arschmitz> im going to try and rebase
[12:11:02] <arschmitz> but depending on how ugly it gets...
[12:11:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do a merge, and then make sure the result of the rebase is identical.
[12:11:32] <arschmitz> with the merge 2/3 of the conflicts i could resolve with --theirs
[12:12:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: TBH, if you rebase, and make merge errors as you apply commits one after the other, but in the end the HEAD is identical to what you'd get with a merge, then the history is total junk anyway.
[12:13:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:14:11] <arschmitz> thankfully most of the things i think are trivial 
[12:14:15] <arschmitz> like caret lol
[12:15:02] <arschmitz> it looks like with one major execption its all either trivial white space / btn -> button / caret changes
[12:15:12] <arschmitz> the major execption being toolbar
[12:15:23] <arschmitz> where you did some major stuff and so did another pr
[12:15:52] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but the key to that is to run the tests at each step of the rebase
[12:16:27] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: when i was working on classes i did a rebase of the whole like 45 commit branch stopping at every single commit and running the tests
[12:17:00] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: At that point you might as well just cherry-pick.
[12:18:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: point being you can make sure you have a clean history no matter how big the change
[12:18:19] <arschmitz> it just requires some work
[12:28:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's true, and you can make sure the changes are exactly the ones intended if you compare the cherry-picked changeset with the original changeset.
[12:29:02] <arschmitz> yup
[12:29:18] <arschmitz> i often cherry pick instead of rebase
[12:29:28] <arschmitz> its easier to see the proper changes some times i thnk
[12:30:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, it just sucks that if subsequent commits touch the same file, you have to shepherd changes through which you know will be undone/superseded/etc. by later commits :/
[12:30:48] <arschmitz> yup
[12:30:59] <arschmitz> there is a way around that but its not generally a good idea
[12:31:11] <arschmitz> you can tell git to remember your resolution
[12:31:21] <gabriel_schulhof> *shudder*
[12:31:23] <arschmitz> and it will automatically reapply it 
[12:31:55] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, actually, if you're going one commit at a time and testing and checking at every step, it may not be such a bad idea.
[12:32:10] <arschmitz> yeah its a global thing though if i recall
[12:32:26] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, you turn it on, rebase, turn it off *shrug*
[12:32:34] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:32:43] <arschmitz> i dont remember exactly how it works i only used it once
[12:33:39] <gabriel_schulhof> I used to maintain a downstream port of pidgin, where every feature I added was on its own branch, so you can imagine when I was rebasing all those branches onto a later upstream revision ... insanity.
[12:34:27] <gabriel_schulhof> Unfortunately that was mtn, not git, so it didn't have that option, though I could've /really/ used it.

[13:23:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hmm im actually cranking through this rebase
[13:23:14] <arschmitz> the changes have all been trivial
[13:41:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Excellent!
[13:48:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i only have a couple commits left
[13:48:15] <arschmitz> im doing the textinput classes commit right now
[13:48:19] <arschmitz> thats pretty recent
[13:53:13] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: there was a trick to all the esformatter ones
[13:53:35] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: git checkout --ours {{files}}
[13:53:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: grunt esformatter
[13:53:48] <arschmitz> git add {{files}}
[13:53:52] <arschmitz> lol
[14:06:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and done running tests to see if i broke anything
[14:36:50] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I did something similar when I ran into esformatter-related commits.
[14:37:22] <arschmitz> well i mean you know that will do the right thing with out even looking
[15:18:14] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: This theme handling cannot be used in places where a themed element is instantiated in response to an option change, because it needs to be themed as soon as it's instantiated. For example, the popup's arrow is added when the arrow option goes from false to true or "l,t,b,r" and the theme class needs to be added there and then.
[15:19:01] <arschmitz> so it would have to run only on set options
[15:19:07] <arschmitz> not on create?
[15:20:41] <gabriel_schulhof> No, actually, setOptions doesn't work either, because during setOptions it would try to apply a theme before the arrow is instantiated.
[15:21:25] <arschmitz> so you need to be able to call it directly?
[15:22:30] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I think so, because if you turn on the arrow at the same time as you theme it (IOW, { arrow: true, theme: "b" }), then it won't work.
[15:23:09] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because the theme extension will process the theme: "b" portion before its super processes the arrow: true portion.
[15:23:39] <gabriel_schulhof> So, the fact that the theme extension overrides _create() and _setOptions() actually imposes some limitations on what you can do.
[15:24:11] <gabriel_schulhof> In the case of _create(), it makes it more difficult to add the theme classes before you attach the elements to the DOM, and in the case of _setOptions you run into situations like the above.
[15:24:47] <gabriel_schulhof> So, ideally, the theme extension would allow you to call a function at a time of your own chosing to update the themed elements.
[15:25:06] <gabriel_schulhof> So, it'd be more of a mixin than an extension.
[15:26:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Something like this._updateTheme( [ "theme", "overlayTheme" ] ); or this._updateTheme( [ "overlayTheme" ] ) - like, which portions of the theme need updating?
[15:33:45] <arschmitz> the general case you want it to be automattic though
[15:34:07] <arschmitz> so im thinking extract the setting logic
[15:34:44] <arschmitz> and add another param to the object that allows you to disable automagic on a per themeElement basis
[15:46:43] <gabriel_schulhof> That sounds good.
