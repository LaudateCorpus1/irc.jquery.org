[04:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman: If you're interested in helping with the rewrites, that'd be awesome.
[04:40:45] <ngsilverman> scott_gonzalez: I am
[04:41:02] <ngsilverman> I've been looking at the sortable code a lot these last few days
[04:41:14] <ngsilverman> from one bug I stumbled onto several others
[04:41:48] <ngsilverman> I could work on that
[04:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman: Any chance you're available for a Skype call on Monday at 11?
[04:43:54] <ngsilverman> which timezone?
[04:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> Eastern
[04:44:27] <ngsilverman> sure
[04:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> Invite sent.
[04:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> We're having an API discussion about droppable.
[04:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll be a good intro for you to what we're doing with the rewrites.
[04:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've gotta go, but I'll try to catch up with you before that call.
[04:46:52] <ngsilverman> ok, great
[04:46:55] <ngsilverman> I'll be here
[04:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> And I'll land your PR(s) soon.
[04:47:01] <ngsilverman> ;)
[04:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yesterday was busy with the release :-)
