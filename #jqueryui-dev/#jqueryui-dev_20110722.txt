[08:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano, jzaefferer: when is a good time to talk about widget factory docs?
[08:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> adoven, kborchers: check out http://jqueryui.com/about :-)
[08:22:25] <kborchers> sweet!
[09:40:13] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: 3 or 4 in the afternoon works for me, got a meeting at 2
[09:40:23] <ajpiano> guess it depends on our friend with the 6 hour time advantage jzaefferer :D
[09:40:39] <ajpiano> btw, have you guys seen http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[09:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> looks pretty nice
[23:03:17] <elliotf> I'm having a weird problem with the autocomplete widget where if I select some text then hit escape, the text is wiped out.
[23:03:37] <elliotf> this is using..
[23:04:05] <elliotf> jquery 1.6.2, jquery ui 1.8.14
[23:04:21] <elliotf> google doesn't seem to know anything about it
[23:05:13] <elliotf> on ff5 and chrome nightly and chrome stable
[23:05:22] <elliotf> haven't tried anything else.
[23:05:26] <elliotf> making a simplified version
[23:05:53] <elliotf> basically, I'd like some suggestions for how to figure out when it's happening.
[23:06:23] <elliotf> maybe I'll try asking the question in #jquery
[23:06:37] <elliotf> since the debugging part is sort of general
[23:09:00] <elliotf> wow, okay.. it happens in the simplest of cases..
[23:09:05] <elliotf> pastebin()ing
[23:15:29] <elliotf> http://jsbin.com/enulud/2
[23:15:36] <elliotf> wow, it's just the escape key
[23:44:50] <danheberden> elliotf you'll have better support help in #jquery
[23:44:58] <danheberden> also, 1.8.14 doesn't support 1.6.2
[23:45:39] <elliotf> danheberden: yes, I'm getting support there.
[23:45:48] <danheberden> fantastic
[23:47:02] <elliotf> danheberden: thank you for the suggestion.
[23:47:06] <elliotf> the channel seems pretty dead.
[23:47:18] <danheberden> this one? it's just for dev OF ui
[23:47:42] <danheberden> #jquery is where all the `is these a bug?` requests go to :)
[23:48:16] <elliotf> true, true.  :)
