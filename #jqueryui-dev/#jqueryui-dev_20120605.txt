[06:13:16] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: hello
[06:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> hey Justin_o
[06:14:27] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: picking up our conversation for the other day about the orca and jQuery UI accordion and tabs
[06:14:44] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: i was talking to clown in the fluid-work irc channel yesterday  http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/fluid-work+IRC+Logs-2012-06-04
[06:15:07] <Justin_o> the conversation is a bit sparse so you might have to wade through the logs a bit :(
[06:15:44] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: one interesting piece is this bug report that he was able to dig up https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=638062
[06:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...the bug tracker isn't loading for me: http://cl.ly/2O3o3g1L2Y1J3K0x0k2G
[06:19:08] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: also he passed along an example from oaa. http://www.oaa-accessibility.org/example/37/ which had the same problem as the master demo you sent me
[06:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> Finally loaded on the third refresh :-P
[06:20:14] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: :) maybe they were doing some maintenance or something
[06:21:04] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: it's not exactly clear if the issue there is the same as what I've seen but it at least sounds similar
[06:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: Just finished reading the conversation.
[06:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> We can ping Firefox devs about this and see if they can comment on the Orca ticket.
[06:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: David Bolter suggests trying Accerciser https://live.gnome.org/Accerciser
[06:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What's the method you said that will give me a post id from a path?
[06:52:07] <nacin> get_page_by_path
[06:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Does that work for custom post types too or just pages?
[07:02:03] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: function get_page_by_path($page_path, $output = OBJECT, $post_type = 'page')
[07:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> ah, thanks
[07:17:51] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] rdworth pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_Cnlvg
[07:17:51] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Added pygmentize. Changed uncategorized slug to lowercase. Upped grunt-wordpress to 0.1.1 - Richard D. Worth
[07:19:11] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: i'll try that out when i get a chance.. possibly later today or tomorrow
[07:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> Justin_o: clown said he already checked, but was going to do more investigation.
[07:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> You should check with him to avoid duplicating efforts :-)
[07:20:50] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: thanks.. for the heads up.. he's the expert anyways.. so i'll clear out of his way :)
[07:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this conversation is happening in #accessibility on Mozilla IRC
[07:22:06] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: thanks.. clown just pinged me in the #fluid-work channel about it too… do you know if #accessibility is logged?
[07:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure. https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC doesn't say anything about logs.
[07:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like there are a few logs, but not for #accessibility :-/
[07:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning/browse_thread/thread/7b2bbcaefc029f15
[07:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/accessibility/20120605
[07:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> A little URL hacking goes a long way :-)
[07:27:04] <Justin_o> scott_gonzalez: :) thanks
[09:38:31] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 2 new commits to 1-8-stable: http://git.io/-CTItw
[09:38:31] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Tagging the 1.8.21 release. - Scott González
[09:38:31] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/1-8-stable] Updating the 1-8-stable version to 1.8.22pre - Scott González
[10:17:03] <steveoh> anyone know if jquery ui 1.8.20 will be hosted on google cdn in the near future?
[11:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> steveoh: No, we don't know.
[11:18:42] <steveoh> in 1.8.20 fresh off the press
[11:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> Fresh off the press? No. 1.8.21 is being released today.
[11:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.20 is over a month old.
[12:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> Emails sent. Damian is away on conferences and Google doesn't seem to care anymore, so we'll see how long it takes for CDNs to update...
[12:34:32] <scott_gonzalez> I do send emails to Damian, Scott, and Eilon though, plus they get a notification from the upload. So, presumably someone at MS should be responding...
