[05:46:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: Any thoughts on what to do with @version when we split up core?
[05:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[05:46:56] <arschmitz> we define $.ui.version = @version in core
[05:46:58] <jzaefferer> $.extend( $.ui, {version: "@VERSION"})
[05:47:14] <arschmitz> i mean should that be its own file?
[05:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> That will still exist.
[05:47:25] <arschmitz> with just that?
[05:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[05:48:07] <arschmitz> and the support 1.7 stuff is inner / outer width / height and addBack
[05:48:10] <arschmitz> all one file or 2
[05:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> One file.
[05:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> You either want to support 1.7 or you don't.
[05:49:01] <arschmitz> sounds good
[05:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be impossible for users to manage it otherwise.
[05:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> Because nothing will ever declare a dependency on the methods.
[05:49:19] <arschmitz> yeah you would have to fine everything that used one of those functions
[05:49:27] <arschmitz> by hand
[05:50:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: cool ill send a PR shortly iv moved everything execpt those
[05:53:06] <arschmitz> it can't land until demos but does not depend on or effect those changes in any way
[05:53:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: we sure gained a lot of new files :-)

[08:18:42] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[08:18:54] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: Pong
[08:19:08] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Hey! About the popup classes PR ...
[08:19:36] <gabrielschulhof> I thought we had agreed that in the enhanced case the only way to not auto-remove classes upon destroy() was to reset the hash doing the tracking ...
[08:19:53] <gabrielschulhof> Is that not the case?
[08:19:54] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: yes your right
[08:20:37] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: So, is this OK after all? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8068#discussion-diff-32483732R867
[08:22:03] <arschmitz> yes
[08:22:22] <arschmitz> it just seemed bad but your right its correct
[08:23:21] <gabrielschulhof> It /is/ bad, because the tracking should be encapsulated, but there's no other way to reconcile it with the need to preserve classes *shrug*
[08:23:47] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Tracking was not designed with enhanced in mind.
[08:24:46] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: enhanced has gotten kinda weird in 1.5 anyway
[08:25:09] <arschmitz> its scope has changed quite a bit
[08:25:20] <gabrielschulhof> How do you mean?
[08:26:07] <arschmitz> well that it still adds classes
[08:26:09] <arschmitz> regardless
[08:26:33] <arschmitz> and we decided to still apply non layout things like aria either way
[08:26:52] <arschmitz> so now its really only about adding actual markup
[08:28:12] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, I guess since modifying attributes such that they don't actually change has become cheap, there's no real distinction between enhanced and non-enhanced, except the establishment of the markup structure.
[08:29:12] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i could really use your help debugging a test when you have time
[08:29:21] <arschmitz> i got the multiple enhancer all passing execpt one test
[08:29:25] <arschmitz> im totally lost on
[08:29:31] <arschmitz> it seems completely unrelated
[08:29:36] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: OK. Lay it on me.
[08:29:48] <arschmitz> its the selectmenu chached test
[08:29:59] <arschmitz> just a sec let me push what i have
[08:30:04] <gabrielschulhof> OK.
[08:31:44] <arschmitz> crap my local repo is having issues
[08:32:03] <arschmitz> it will take a few minutes for me to fix it
[08:32:16] <arschmitz> why did i ever think it was ok to keep my repos in my dropbox?
[08:33:13] <gabrielschulhof> Isn't that a bit redundant? I mean, github /is/ the cloud for git ...
[08:33:28] <arschmitz> only once you commit an push
[08:33:56] <gabrielschulhof> Well, yeah ... that's true ...
[08:34:05] <arschmitz> so for example
[08:34:16] <arschmitz> if my laptop died right now before i push my local changes
[08:34:22] <arschmitz> id lose all changes
[08:34:30] <gabrielschulhof> True.
[08:34:40] <arschmitz> problem is sometimes dropbox flakes out and makes hundreds of conflicted copy files
[08:34:55] <arschmitz> so right now my repo contains hundreds of new files
[08:35:00] <gabrielschulhof> Ugh ...
[08:35:04] <arschmitz> and the new ones are the right ones
[08:35:10] <arschmitz> and the normal named ones are old
[08:35:18] <arschmitz> including stuff int the .git directory
[08:35:32] <gabrielschulhof> How often does dropbox sync?
[08:35:57] <arschmitz> well that might be the issue
[08:36:05] <arschmitz> iv been out of space for liek a year lol
[08:36:27] <arschmitz> i had syncing turned off
[08:36:31] <arschmitz> but it got turned on some how
[08:38:01] <arschmitz> but normally it watches your file system
[08:38:06] <arschmitz> and syncs any time it sees a change
[08:38:33] <arschmitz> i need to write a bash script for this
[08:38:35] <arschmitz> lol
[08:39:40] <gabrielschulhof> Hmmm ... yeah ... the semantics of git are a bit different ...
[08:40:31] <gabrielschulhof> I mean, you could do the same with git, and end up with a branch that has a million little commits, but ... meh ...

[09:06:40] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I've pulled your branch and I'm running the tests.
[09:06:51] <arschmitz> cool
[09:07:35] <gabrielschulhof> How come your branch touches the UI widgets?
[09:07:53] <arschmitz> huh?
[09:33:30] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: enhancer-multiple~1: "Build: Fix dev dependency on jQuery and update dependencies"
[09:33:46] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: That commit touches a bunch of files in external.
[09:34:14] <arschmitz> well its a grunt-bowercopy
[09:34:41] <arschmitz> to update the dependencies
[09:34:48] <gabrielschulhof> Right, but shouldn't that be on 1.5-dev?
[09:35:00] <arschmitz> it will be once this lands
[09:35:07] <arschmitz> but those updates were needed to test this
[09:35:17] <arschmitz> and i had no one around to review
[09:35:38] <gabrielschulhof> OK. Gotcha.
[09:36:10] <arschmitz> all the update dependencies will be squashed into one in the end anyway
[09:36:22] <arschmitz> since they are all branch pulls
[09:36:22] <gabrielschulhof> Well, FWIW, I've reproduced the test failure.
[09:36:35] <arschmitz> yeah thats the easy part lol
[09:36:41] <arschmitz> the hard part is the why?
[09:37:00] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. I have a few ideas, but I'll have to dig into it.
[09:37:11] <gabrielschulhof> ... and the test doesn't fail when it runs by itself, which is bad.
[09:37:38] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:37:40] <arschmitz> if you re run
[09:37:46] <arschmitz> you can get different tests to fail lol
[09:37:55] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah. Terrible.
[09:37:57] <arschmitz> you can get 2 tests to fail in the 4th set
[09:38:01] <arschmitz> or 1 in the 3rd
[09:38:05] <arschmitz> depending 
[09:38:28] <gabrielschulhof> ... on the phase of the moon no doubt, or on the rate of cosmic ray incidence ...
[09:39:06] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh* ... I love our tests ...
[09:39:55] <gabrielschulhof> There's a problem in the DOM of that test page. Two pages with identical ID :/
[09:39:55] <arschmitz> right
[09:40:00] <arschmitz> eah
[09:40:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:40:05] <arschmitz> i tried fixing that
[09:40:09] <arschmitz> it didnt do anything
[09:40:19] <arschmitz> i ran it through a validator and fixed everything
[09:40:21] <arschmitz> and tried 
[09:40:47] <arschmitz> i noticed something bad in a bunch of our tests like this
[09:40:54] <arschmitz> its the entire demo pages from some point copied
[09:41:03] <arschmitz> and we dont use 90% of the markup
[09:41:17] <gabrielschulhof> Ugh ...
[09:41:40] <gabrielschulhof> I'm not surprised though ... it's easy to just remove a test without removing the corresponding markup.
[09:41:51] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: i dont think thats the case
[09:42:01] <arschmitz> i think its the case of not wanting to write markup when writing tests
[09:42:08] <arschmitz> so they just coppied the entire demo page into the tesr
[09:42:30] <arschmitz> including things like headings
[09:42:32] <arschmitz> and explinations
[09:42:35] <gabrielschulhof> OK. This is getting me more and more depressed ...
[09:43:02] <arschmitz> Yeah no idea who did it or when
[09:43:07] <arschmitz> but i know its not recent
[09:43:19] <gabrielschulhof> I think I'll take a break for dinner and I'll dig in after my daughter's asleep ...
[09:43:24] <arschmitz> none of us would have done that or would have let it through the review process
[09:43:31] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: awesome thanks

[16:25:44] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Woah! Why is it that on master, cached-tests.html is, like, 1000x faster ... ?
[16:26:03] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no idea
[16:26:20] <arschmitz> i dont think anything should really have even changed with that
[16:26:20] <gabrielschulhof> "Disquieting..." -- Linus Torvalds
[16:26:49] <gabrielschulhof> Not wrt. enhancer, but just in general ... *gulp*
[16:27:13] <arschmitz> i cant think of anything in 1.5 dev that should make much difference
[16:30:21] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: quick guess based on the test failure and the test name
[16:30:26] <arschmitz> its not caching lol
[16:30:49] <arschmitz> which may be an issue with the enhancer 
[16:34:41] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah ... it's not caching. It's reloading the page, resulting in a dupe, instead of finding that the page is already there and switching to it.
[16:35:23] <gabrielschulhof> The question is this: is the issue with the enhancer a bug that the new enhancer has exposed in another component, or is it a bug in the enhancer.
[16:35:29] <gabrielschulhof> ?
[16:37:31] <arschmitz> yeah
[16:37:36] <arschmitz> i could not find the cause
[16:38:28] <gabrielschulhof> Well, I'll check why it's failing to find the cached page. enhancer or not, that's a problem.
[16:38:36] <arschmitz> yup
[16:39:19] <gabrielschulhof> At the very least I'll be able to construct a test case that exposes this problem without the modified enhancer.
[16:41:24] <gabrielschulhof> OK, this is going to have to be tomorrow's struggle ... I need to go to bed ...
