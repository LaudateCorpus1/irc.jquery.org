[12:26:52] <rxaviers> I can squash the last four bba2b1c, 6e4de14, 43467fc, 9c2fefd into a single one.
[12:26:57] <rxaviers> Does it help?
[12:27:33] <rxaviers> Although each one is pretty big and well scoped for its own, we can create one single review fix commit
[12:32:11] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ^
[12:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldnt' squash those together.
[12:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> Why would we keep 2 file renames that just cancel each other out?
[12:33:26] <rxaviers> Dropping the first one conflicts all subsequent commits.
[12:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:34:00] <rxaviers> It's doable, but kinda pain :(
[12:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like this should be relatively easy to script, but I don't feel like figuring out what would actually need to be scripted.
[12:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> Go ahead and leave it.
[12:38:59] <rxaviers> ok

[12:48:48] <arschmitz> not the whole contents 
[12:48:52] <arschmitz> just the demos part
[12:48:53] <gseguin> that's not going to work well
[12:49:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: why?
[12:49:24] <gseguin> because the demos on the website have been altered manually to display the right version in the banner if I remember correctly
[12:49:36] <gseguin> until a certain version at least
[12:50:05] <arschmitz> ahh ok was not aware of that
[12:50:21] <gseguin> I think that might have been before your time
[12:50:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: why dont you do a PR for it so we can make sure it looks all set
[12:50:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: probably
[12:51:05] <gseguin> ok, wanna check in a README.md to init the repo?
[12:51:27] <arschmitz> sure
[12:51:32] <gseguin> I'll clean up the rest of the dir and prepare a PR
[12:51:45] <gseguin> want one big commit?

[13:05:07] <arschmitz> lol
[13:05:33] <arschmitz> i wasent intending it to be copy and past but you are 100% correct
[13:06:12] <arschmitz> gseguin: we will also want to add to the release script to update this file and upload the demos to this repo
[13:06:17] <arschmitz> similar to the cdn repo
[13:13:00] <gseguin> arschmitz: the way it works right now is it takes the latest stable version
[13:13:13] <gseguin> no real need to update it on release
[13:14:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: you still need to push the new demos on release and this means no need for any type of logic in the repo
[13:14:17] <arschmitz> just static files
[13:14:41] <gseguin> but if you have a php file you can have a minimum of logic
[13:15:07] <gseguin> with semver it's quite easy to pick up the latest stable release
[13:16:12] <gseguin> we have a 1.0a4.1, how does that translate in semver? 1.0.0-alpha.5 ?
[13:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> Just do the simple thing and update index.php from the release script.
[13:16:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: we shouldnt change the names
[13:16:59] <gseguin> they're not semver
[13:17:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: thats not what they were called when they were released so no one would look for that
[13:17:21] <arschmitz> its too late we all ready did it wrong we cant change it now
[13:17:34] <gseguin> arschmitz: I don't agree, these are just directory names
[13:17:52] <gseguin> the version itself is somewhat semver compliant
[13:18:26] <gseguin> the 1.4a4.1 is the only one that is causing trouble
[13:18:37] <gseguin> because we already have a 1.0a4
[13:18:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/04/07/jquery-alpha-4-1-maintenance-release/
[13:19:29] <arschmitz> it was announced and named as 1.4a4.1 so thats what it should be
[13:19:40] <gseguin> hmm, I see there are already links to them
[13:19:45] <gseguin> ok, fair enough
[13:19:50] <arschmitz> and if you just do the simple thing and update the index from the release this does not matter
[13:19:59] <gseguin> here we go again... rsync ;)
[13:20:04] <arschmitz> because it just write to it on release of a stable version
[13:20:54] <gseguin> so I'll just remove the tests directories and push a PR

[13:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> So why are they going into demos.jquerymobile.com?
[13:42:04] <gseguin> sorry I wasn't clear
[13:42:23] <gseguin> that PR contains everything that is currently on jquerymobile.com
[13:42:32] <gseguin> + 1.3.1 & 1.3.2
[13:42:43] <gseguin> which for some reason weren't on the website
[13:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> Why? Is this not a demo site?
[13:43:31] <gseguin> Why what? 
[13:43:36] <gseguin> not sure I'm following
[13:43:52] <gseguin> why weren't 1.3.1 & 1.3.2 on there?
[13:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> Why are we copying non-demos to demos.jquerymobile.com?
[13:44:13] <gseguin> these are only demos
[13:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll ask my initial question again.
[13:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> m I missing something or do the early versions not actually have demos?
[13:44:49] <gseguin> I rsynced jquerymobile.com:/var/www/jquerymobile.com/htdocs/demos/ into the repo
[13:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> Did you look at the content?
[13:45:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: we need to make sure this are all actually working demos
[13:45:18] <gseguin> yes
[13:45:23] <gseguin> not all of them
[13:45:26] <gseguin> but a sample
[13:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> All I see is a set of docs for early versions.
[13:45:50] <gseguin> docs were demos
[13:45:59] <gseguin> as well
[13:46:20] <arschmitz> yeah until 1.3 there was no difference
[13:46:47] <gseguin> does it make more sense?
[13:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't call those demos, but ok.
[13:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> They look like pure documentation to me.
[13:47:56] <gseguin> but they showcase the framework at the same time
[13:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> In a pretry terrible way, honestly.
[13:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't a showcase of how you can build an API site using jQuery Mobile.
[13:48:48] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah but these are all we have and should probably live somewhere
[13:49:08] <arschmitz> and unless we want to make an olddocs.jquerymobile.com lol this seems like the best place
[13:49:17] <arschmitz> unless we just leave them to view
[13:49:29] <arschmitz> and start this only with 1.3 and newer?
[13:49:39] <gseguin> but then you have to change the links in the old blog posts
[13:50:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: thats not any different then with demos.jquerymobile.com
[13:50:03] <gseguin> I'm going to remove the pre versions as they don't seem to work
[13:50:37] <gseguin> aren't we going to proxy jquerymobile/demos to demos.jquerymobile.com ?
[13:50:45] <gseguin> I thought that was the plan
[13:51:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: you can direct some to one place and some to another
[13:52:01] <arschmitz> not sure we want to do that
[13:52:05] <arschmitz> but its possible
