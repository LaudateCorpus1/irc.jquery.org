[06:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nice "new relative fields such as "last Sunday", and "now";"
[06:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> JSON. improved support, including new structure and data.
[06:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, new structure :-P
[06:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> That should be interesting, if they keep changing structure.

[09:50:16] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: sounds like you should report the issues you have to their mailing list, even if you end up with our own "resolver" for a lack of an official solution
[09:50:35] <jzaefferer> it would certainly be a good thing if our usage and feedback feeds back into improvements on the CLDR side
[10:03:53] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, sorry for the delay went get a coffee. Yeap, absolutely. Will do
[10:53:20] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez fnagel1 If either of you have a minute I'm wondering if you could explain to me why you have to give the select a width for selectmenu. I read the Wiki comments and I still don't get it.
[10:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> So that it doesn't grow/shrink as you change the selected option.
[10:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> Native selects are always as wide as the widest option.
[10:56:26] <tj_vantoll> Couldn't we build the menu, detect its width, then use that as the width for the button?
[11:05:17] <tj_vantoll> Users wouldn't be able to set a width in CSS, but they could set a max-width.
[11:26:42] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: could you take a look at this? The description got better, it should be easy now to see the issue (in case you've looked at the ticket before): https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6490
[11:26:42] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Issue #6490 by PangbornIdentity (5d 19h ago): Keeping Panel Wrapper in Tact when removing panels
[11:27:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i actually reviewed his PR yesterday
[11:28:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: I asked him to make some changes but that i agreed with what he was trying to do
[11:28:15] <jzaefferer> yeah well, the PR was probably crap, but the issue is there
[11:29:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i never disagreed with the issue
[11:29:18] <arschmitz> i actually had not realized there was an issue for it i saw the PR first
[11:29:19] <jzaefferer> he updated the issue, before I had trouble actually seeing what was going on
[11:29:53] <jzaefferer> "// Destroy the wrapper even if there are still other panels, because we don't know if they use a wrapper" - that seems odd
[11:30:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i was giving him a chance to update his PR based on my comments
[11:30:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah i agree that makes no sense
[11:30:40] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: if he does not update soon ill just do it myself before the RC
[11:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi agcolom: Can I get confirmation that the new jquerymobile.com will be live for 1.4 final?
[11:32:37] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: I don't understand how a property or attribute on the wrapper helps at all. The wrapper can't be removed if there are still panels, right? 
[11:32:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: actually i was just adding a comment about that
[11:33:08] <gseguin> uGoMobi: re-attempting to upload the demos on jquerymobile.com
[11:33:11] <arschmitz> that after reading the issue this should not be an option
[11:33:36] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: it should always check if other panels are using the wrapper and proceed based on that
[11:33:46] <jzaefferer> yeah, that makes more sense
[11:34:15] <jzaefferer> you're going to comment that on the issue?
[11:34:20] <arschmitz> yes
[11:34:29] <arschmitz> i was already typing it
[11:34:44] <jzaefferer> cool
[11:34:45] <jzaefferer> thanks
[11:34:51] <arschmitz> no problem
[11:35:22] <gseguin> uGoMobi: don't get it, it's working locally but not on the server
[11:35:52] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'll dig into it when I have time, in the meantime users can use view.jquerymobile.com
[11:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What versions of jQuery core does Mobile 1.3 support?
[11:38:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: 1.7.0 to 1.9.0
[11:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> What about Mobile 1.4
[11:39:44] <arschmitz> 1.8.0 to 2..0
[11:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> 1.3 doesn't work with 1.10?
[11:40:14] <arschmitz> it was not out yet
[11:40:22] <arschmitz> so it might but it was not tested
[11:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> or 1.9.1?
[11:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just going to write 1.7 and newer
[11:40:46] <arschmitz> it should work with with 1.9.x
[11:41:00] <scott_gonzalez> If we get reports that it doesn't work with 1.10, we can adjust the text.
[11:41:01] <arschmitz> but what we actually documented was 1.9.0
[11:41:15] <arschmitz> but yes it should be fine
[11:41:46] <fnagel1> tj_vantoll: Anything more on selectmenu width?
[11:44:26] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #6514: Icon not clickable in buttons with data-mini="true"  02http://git.io/9C90QQ
[11:44:33] <tj_vantoll> fnagel1: Was wondering the widget could build the menu, detect its width, then use that as the width for the button?
[11:45:51] <fnagel1> I would like to avoid different width of native select and the widget button. Most CSS frameworks have predefined width (classes) for all native form elements, so we need to make sure user are able to use these.
[11:46:42] <arschmitz> fnagel1: i completely agree
[11:46:47] <tj_vantoll> ok
[11:46:55] <tj_vantoll> That makes sense.
[11:47:03] <fnagel1> But using the menu width does not work that way
[11:47:45] <fnagel1> We encourage poeple to use the native select for almost everything: set indey, set value, set disbaled states, ... but not for button width?
[12:03:49] <arschmitz> fnagel1: do you mean have them set the width in their css on the native element and then use that width to set the width of the generate button?
[12:05:18] <fnagel1> Basically yes. Perhaps along with some option, but this is one of the most important usecase in my opinion
[12:05:51] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: That's how it works now http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/Tm3my/
[12:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that we can't detect `width: auto`
[12:07:18] <arschmitz> fnagel1: for sure this is eventually going to be adopted by mobile and we generally do everything 100% width by default
[12:08:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: also in mobile things tend to be hidden when initialization occurs so calculating width is buggy 
[12:08:27] <arschmitz> not really buggy just does not work
[12:08:57] <fnagel1> scott_gonzalez: thats the problem, right. If we use native select width people will complain they need to set width and it wont work for via auto magic
[12:09:23] <fnagel1> But I agree native select and selectmenu styling could be different. 
[12:09:42] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, it surprised me when I first used the widget. I had to dig into how the demos worked.
[12:09:43] <fnagel1> arschmitz: +1
[12:09:50] <tj_vantoll> But I think if it's documented we'll be fine.
[12:10:09] <fnagel1> How to catch the "different styling" issue?
[12:10:27] <fnagel1> or is it no real issue as JS should be supported most of the time?
[12:10:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think that is the plan but I don't know who is moving the blog and the custom builder
[12:11:21] <agcolom> (sorry deep into geography homework for a part of the evening...)
[12:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The blog isn't moving.
[12:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it is eventually, but not for the 1.4 release.
[12:11:49] <agcolom> ok
[12:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure who's working on the builder. uGoMobi?
[12:12:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: gseguin is the man for the builder 
[12:13:28] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I can confirm we change to new web site when we release 1.4 final
[12:14:15] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck is working on new web site
[12:14:31] <RWhitbeck> THAT'S ME!!!!
[12:14:43] <RWhitbeck> builder I am not though
[12:14:44] <uGoMobi> hey RWhitbeck, how goes?
[12:14:54] <RWhitbeck> I think that is gseguin
[12:14:56] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:15:45] <RWhitbeck> ah sorry I scanned the back channel quickly.   Jumped to conclusions
[12:15:57] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I am (or have been). 'sup?
[12:17:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: maybe arschmitz or someone from the infra team can help with getting the demos up
[12:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Just wanted to confirm that jquerymobile.com would be running on jquery-wp-content when 1.4 is released.
[12:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> And the builder came up since it's integrated, but separate.
[12:18:40] <gseguin> As long as we maintain the proxy it should continue to work
[12:19:10] <gseguin> uGoMobi: something is going on with paths
[12:19:21] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: how about the ThemeRoller?
[12:19:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: anything i can help with
[12:19:35] <arschmitz> ?
[12:19:36] <gseguin> uGoMobi: when you click on a link it goes back one too many directory
[12:19:43] <uGoMobi> :/
[12:19:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: I can re-upload it and you can take a look if you want
[12:20:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: what the directory they are going in ?
[12:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: I don't know how any of this stuff is set up on jquerymobile.com right now.
[12:20:49] <uGoMobi> the plan is to have all demos on jquerymobile.com/demos/ instead of view.*
[12:20:54] <gseguin> arschmitz: /var/www/jquerymobile.com/htdocs/demos/1.4.0-beta.1
[12:21:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: its because your using demos in the url
[12:21:18] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll re-upload them
[12:21:24] <arschmitz> there is a script that rewrites urls in the menus
[12:21:45] <arschmitz> so they work regardless of directory depth and they look for demos in the path
[12:22:09] <arschmitz> so by placing it in a demos folder then demos appears twice in the url 
[12:22:10] <gseguin> oh that's why
[12:22:20] <gseguin> demos is already in the path
[12:22:34] <gseguin> DAMMIT WILTO!
[12:22:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: hes not even here to yell at anymore!
[12:23:01] <gseguin> I know :)
[12:23:11] <arschmitz> toddparker isnt either
[12:23:44] <arschmitz> i guess you can yell at scottjehl__ to yell at Wilto
[12:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Don't they live in opposite sides of the country?
[12:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't Wilto all the way north and Scott all the way south?
[12:24:44] <arschmitz> yeah but they talk all day every day
[12:24:47] <gseguin> yup
[12:25:15] <gseguin> arschmitz: so I re-uploaded the files
[12:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> Amazing. What kind of crazy science is that?!?
[12:25:46] <gseguin> it's probably facilitated by the jqueries
[12:26:36] <gseguin> arschmitz: we're going to have to change that script to look for the last "demos" in the path
[12:26:44] <gseguin> that shouldn't be too hard
[12:26:51] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup 
[12:27:17] <arschmitz> but wont really work for beta because we already tagged
[12:27:24] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: will you be around during Mobile meeting tomorrow?
[12:27:35] <uGoMobi> might be good to discuss these infrastructure things
[12:27:41] <uGoMobi> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1061R4ogg1OHKEpfmNWtXKqgoDY4MubiQbVVs-ENPA9I/edit#
[12:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> I should be, but someone from Joyent is supposed to call around that time.
[12:28:16] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:28:36] <uGoMobi> we can pick another moment to discuss this
[12:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll make sure to be in the meeting, but if I'm on the phone, I'll be slow to respond.
[12:29:03] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:29:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill log in to the server at some point before then to see how themeroller is working right now too since it seems no one knows :)
[12:29:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[12:31:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you thought about using the same document for a running meeting notes like we do for devleads?
[12:31:17] <arschmitz> that way it can be bookmarked
[12:31:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I did
[12:31:45] <uGoMobi> was actually thinking about using a spread with tabs
[12:32:06] <arschmitz> yeah however just think it would be nice to have a single document
[12:32:14] <uGoMobi> I totally agree
[12:32:18] <arschmitz> then if we think of something on monday we can add it before we forget :)
[12:32:37] <uGoMobi> yup
[12:32:55] <fnagel1> As we started to discuss this: any conclusion about selectmenu width?
[12:32:56] <arschmitz> cool was just throwing that out there
[12:32:58] <uGoMobi> and the community will have one doc in their Google drive
[12:34:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Pong!
[12:35:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I can't sign the CAA on behalf of Intel. The lawyers on both sides are chewing on the matter AFAIK.
[12:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, umm...that's fine actually.
[12:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> BUT THANKS FOR MAKING MY LIFE HARDER
[12:36:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will set up new meeting doc when we are done with 1.4
[12:36:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Sorry :/
[12:37:09] <arschmitz> fnagel1: i like your idea in your comment about an option to make it the width of the widest option ( like mobile inline ) or not setting and allowing it to be done with just css
[12:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's not your fault :-)
[12:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> I just need to build in support for corporate CLA/CAA in the copyright audit.
[12:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> I knew I'd need to do it eventually.
[12:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% sure Intel has already signed one.
[12:40:39] <fnagel1> arschmitz: talking about which comment? 
[12:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...apparently Intel hasn't signed yet, they're dragging it out.
[12:41:54] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah ... I ask about it once in a while, and the answer is always the same ... 
[12:42:06] <arschmitz> fnagel1: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#cr1379364438
[12:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, at least for UI it's just one commit from you :-P
[12:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> We're down to 358 commits by 77 authors that aren't accounted for in UI.
[12:45:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: getting there
[12:45:46] <arschmitz> slowly
[12:45:56] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I gotcha by the balls now ... hardy har har! :)
[12:46:38] * _|Nix|_ digresses
[12:47:46] <fnagel1> arschmitz: I think you misiterpreted my intention. Comment about mobile was just for information. Mobile uses the width of current selected item, not the longest. See Scotts comment for more info: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu#comment1379343169
[12:48:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was looking at panel destroy https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L429
[12:48:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree the logic is a bit wrong
[12:48:27] <arschmitz> fnagel1: i was just saying it was similar not exactly the same
[12:48:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we shouldn't check if display mode is overlay, but just if there is a wrapper and no other panels
[12:49:32] <arschmitz> fnagel1: we are flexible with implementation still i simply meant one that is a set width versus a css width
[12:49:56] <fnagel1> arschmitz: Perhaps I don't understand your point but having the widest option as a default button width as its not possible. 
[12:50:36] <fnagel1> arschmitz: Agree. +1 for width option (int) and backfall to CSS width (!= "auto")
[12:54:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i think we need to check if there are other panels that actually use an overlay
[12:55:17] <arschmitz> nnot overlay but wrapper
[12:55:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: dont want to keep a wrapper if no other panel needs it
[12:55:49] <arschmitz> even if panels still exist
[12:58:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was in doubt about that
[12:59:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im really confused though maybe you changed this
[12:59:25] <arschmitz> it looks like a wrapper is being generated even if the panel is outside the page?
[12:59:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:59:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why?
[12:59:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because transitioning the page didn't work, remember
[13:00:01] <uGoMobi> that's what we tried first
[13:00:23] <uGoMobi> but because it didn't work we switched back to using a wrapper
[13:01:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok we went in so many circles with that
[13:01:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but now I think of it again you are right that we should check if those other panels (if any) need a wrapper
[13:01:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[13:02:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see his comment he added like ten minutes ago?
[13:02:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, just saw it
[13:03:30] <arschmitz> i think he has the right idea im going to ask him to update his PR based on that
[13:03:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you have a panel outside page, do we never call the detroy method right?
[13:03:49] <arschmitz> we should be if we are not!
[13:04:12] <uGoMobi> but when?
[13:04:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no destroy runs regardless
[13:04:35] <arschmitz> there is logic in there to check about internal vs external i helped you write it
[13:05:50] <uGoMobi> when I have an internal panel it is destroyed together with the page
[13:06:02] <uGoMobi> the widget factory takes care of that, correct?
[13:07:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6347 ... you can reproduce it without anything at all. All you need to do is grab window coordinates/dimensions and then scroll the page, and it'll trigger resize events: http://jsbin.com/eDOqAGu/1
[13:07:22] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6347 by doomsy (1mon 1w ago): Scrolling vertically on panel fails after first scroll on ios device (1.4.0a2)
[13:11:13] <uGoMobi> did the OP just say he changed all his anchors to input buttons? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6514#issuecomment-25120196 :/
[13:11:13] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6514 by Loupi (6h 10m ago): Icon not clickable in buttons with data-mini="true"
[13:15:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think he misunderstood what i was suggesting or maybe just lazy
[13:16:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah so i think best we can do is minimize use 
[13:16:30] <arschmitz> and maybe someday remove the workaround
[13:16:45] <arschmitz> problem is 2.3 needs that workaround :(
[13:17:10] <arschmitz> for ios its fixed in 6.0
[13:17:24] <arschmitz> wait i could adjust the scope of the workaround
[13:17:35] <arschmitz> to not include 6.0
[13:17:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think that we should do that
[13:21:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: only think that scares me a little about that is i swear it was originally like that and changed to include 6 for some reason
[13:21:17] <arschmitz> but there is nothing in comments and its pretty thoroughly commented lol
[13:37:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not fixed in 6. My iPod is 6.0.1
[13:37:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no the reason for the workaround is fixed in ios6
[13:37:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait ... you must've meant 7.0.
[13:37:41] <arschmitz> and the workaround is whats causing this
[13:37:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, nice!
[13:37:48] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, absolutely!
[13:38:09] <arschmitz> we will need to test that to be sure because it originally excluded ios6 but not it does not so i think that change was made for a reason
[13:38:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, would it be possible to call this._workarounds() from _makeFixed instead of _create()?
[13:38:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i saw your question about that earlier give me just a second
[13:39:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm not sure how well the toolbar handles toggling the position option to/from fixed.
[13:39:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes it should be called from makefixed
[13:39:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[13:40:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i looked at your PR for demo
[13:40:40] <arschmitz> the flat lists did not work for me
[13:41:20] <arschmitz> they were still inset
[13:41:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... only the lists of the sublist are supposed to be flat.
[13:42:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok i guess im confused by the demo
[13:43:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only "A sub-sub-sublist Item" is indented in the first two demos, but not in the third.
[13:43:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont see any difference
[13:44:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the first two, in the last section, there's a single list item indented further than any of the others. In the last example it is not.
[13:44:42] <arschmitz> no in the last example it is too
[13:45:05] <arschmitz> either way i think the demo is unclear
[13:45:18] <arschmitz> for flat lists
[13:45:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/demos/listview-collapsible-item/
[13:45:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I painted the item in question red.
[13:46:13] <arschmitz> ok i see now but i still think this is really confusing
[13:46:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the lists are too long.
[13:46:25] <arschmitz> flat collapsible list should be exactly flat
[13:46:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but the flatness need not start at the root.
[13:46:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes which is fine
[13:47:07] <arschmitz> but the demo does not show this clearly
[13:47:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're right. The list is waaay too long.
[13:47:24] <arschmitz> and does not demonstrate the flat lists clearly
[13:47:40] <arschmitz> you should start out with a list that only has one level of nesting 
[13:47:43] <arschmitz> and show it flat
[13:48:02] <arschmitz> then make a second one where the first level is indented but the second is flat
[13:48:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. I used this list to address all the corner cases, so it's pretty complex. I can simplify it.
[13:48:15] <arschmitz> they only need to have like 3 items each
[13:48:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll start simplifying it.
[13:48:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool thanks
[13:49:28] <arschmitz> it looks good just the flat lists were confusing
[13:53:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We shoul eventually add a listview extension for creating these collapsibles automagically. I mean, to turn <ul><li><ul><li> into <ul><li class="ui-collapsible"><h2></h2><ul><li>
[13:54:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, if we even wanna take that on (again).
[13:54:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no i dont think we should
[13:54:57] <arschmitz> automagicly means adding the data role
[13:55:04] <arschmitz> which they can do
[13:55:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, we wouldn't actually add the data role. We'd go straight for .collapsible()
[13:55:25] <arschmitz> maybe add in classes to the structure for it but thats about it
[13:55:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right i dont think we should
[13:56:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what if you just want a plain old list in your list
[13:56:09] <arschmitz> like bulleted
[13:56:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, actually, that's a good point. We could simply absorb the CSS into the lib so that, if somebody, somewhere, decides to turn a list item into a collapsible, it'll look OK.
[13:56:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also true.
[13:56:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good! Less work for us *wipe hands*
[13:58:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think sometimes mobile trys to make to many things "just work" with out writing any JS
[13:59:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: anyway im heading home for right now ill talk to you in the moring
[13:59:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... that ever-present balance between abstracting for the sake of abstraction and actually simplifying things that are not simple.
[13:59:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm gone all day tomorrow - so, maybe around this time again.
[14:00:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: will you be around for meeting?
[14:00:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Unfortunately that's looking very unlikely.
[14:00:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no problem was just wondering
[14:00:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll be sitting on the bus from another city :/
[14:01:09] <arschmitz> yeah thats cool enjoy whatever your doing !
[14:01:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can try to ssh -t ... screen -dr freenode, but we'll see.
[14:01:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
