[08:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, now I'm just leaving words out instead of misspelling them...
[08:31:43] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: in comments or wiki?
[08:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> comments
[08:32:00] <kborchers> ok, i am working again tonight so i will look
[08:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[08:32:20] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: did you see my comments in here from last night?
[08:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, been busy with client work, just switched back to jQuery.
[08:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> That widget page is new, I just created it this week.
[08:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to document the base widget there if you want.
[08:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> Just create another section for it.
[08:33:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, just wanted to be sure
[08:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> If there's anything confusing, just ask me.
[08:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's entirely possible that there are some cryptic parts of widget.
[08:35:21] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i was just reading through making sure i understood everything last night. there are some interesting pieces but i'll let you know if i don't get something
[08:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
