[00:24:36] <ShamanIotasTook> using google apis to access the jquery and jquery-ui and associated css
[00:24:43] <ShamanIotasTook> but status bar isn't working (everything else is)
[00:25:58] <ShamanIotasTook> tabs, nested tabs, dropdown, buttons (even speech prompts) working perfectly, but cannot seem to get this damn statusbar to initialize and display...anyone have any suggestions?

[04:59:14] <ngsilverman> scott_gonzalez: regarding Globalize, some languages appear to have different names for, say, days or months, depending on whether you're using them in a complete date or alone
[04:59:56] <ngsilverman> looking at Globalize's doc it seems to only deal with formatted dates, which would leave out the standalone translations
[05:00:11] <ngsilverman> is that how we want to proceed?
[05:02:38] <ngsilverman> thinking about datepicker the standalone translations would probably be useful
[11:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman: We probably want both.
[11:26:45] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Certain tests are failing in jqui due to element.on not existing
[11:26:53] <Krinkle> I suppose that's because it was added in 1.7
[11:27:14] <Krinkle> should ui still test against 1.6? It is just the test using it or is it "relied" upon in the lib as well?
[11:27:31] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/5463
[11:27:37] <Krinkle> 2 failes across the board
[11:27:56] <Krinkle> bbl
[12:05:12] <ngsilverman> scott_gonzalez: ok, then we definitely want to rethink the culture files format
[12:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: What's using .on()?
[12:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> UI is never supposed to use that.
[12:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: Thanks, I'll get that fixed.
