[05:28:09] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[05:28:20] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:56:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we already knew responsive panel css didnt work with 1.4 right?
[05:57:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not with external panels
[05:58:00] <arschmitz> no just regular panels
[05:58:09] <arschmitz> internal
[05:58:13] <uGoMobi> should work
[05:58:47] <arschmitz> hm ok someone brought it up to me ill have to have them look closer thought i remembered it being broken
[05:59:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah it was, but I fixed it for alpha 2
[06:12:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok thanks
[06:56:28] <gseguin> mornin'
[06:58:57] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[07:09:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: Do you think we're going to do beta?
[07:10:06] <gseguin> uGoMobi: if so, when?
[07:10:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[07:10:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think Monday
[07:11:39] <gseguin> ok, I don't know if I'll have had time to rewrite the release script by then. That's ok the manual steps are not too painful
[07:12:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: do you have time to do release on Monday?
[07:12:30] <gseguin> yep
[07:12:35] <uGoMobi> ok great
[07:18:14] <gseguin> BTW, I don't know if my commit message was clear but I've modified the git cdn build so the sourcemap should work
[07:18:21] <gseguin> just FYI
[07:19:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: awesome good to know
[07:20:18] <gseguin> haven't tested it though
[07:20:27] * gseguin is not very proud of that
[07:20:41] <gseguin> so let me know if it doesn't work
[07:28:49] <arschmitz> gseguin: will do maybe ill try it out in a bit here im working on some grunt stuff anyway
[07:29:16] <gseguin> oh yeah? what?
[07:36:35] <uGoMobi> gseguin: nice, thanks for fixing sourcemap
[07:36:51] <gseguin> you're very welcome
[07:37:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: what are you working on?
[07:37:18] <arschmitz> changelog
[07:37:21] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we can offer the CSS files to use Grunticon loader with 1.4 beta
[07:37:23] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6167
[07:37:23] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6167 by uGoMobi (1mon 5d ago): New icons: build four CSS files instead of one
[07:37:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: writing a grunt task to generate it 
[07:37:44] <gseguin> oh ok
[07:38:12] <uGoMobi> I can write some documentation about how to use the loader
[07:38:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: do you have time to look at the build script?
[07:40:14] <gseguin> for Grunticon ?
[07:40:49] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ^
[07:40:57] <uGoMobi> gseguin: our build script
[07:41:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we need 4 CSS files
[07:41:22] <uGoMobi> than you can use the loader script from Grunticon
[07:42:00] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I can try but I'm only night and weekends right now which equates to not much time when you have 2 young kids ;)
[07:42:19] <uGoMobi> I understand
[07:43:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we can have a look at the script later this week
[07:43:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[07:43:37] <uGoMobi> if we can't figure it out we bother gseguin  :)
[07:43:48] <gseguin> heh :)
[07:45:24] <uGoMobi> it's not a blocker if we can't make it before beta but would be nice if we can
[07:45:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you think about beta on Monday?
[07:46:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im fine with that unless we get a ticket rush before then
[07:46:31] <uGoMobi> yeah of course
[07:46:31] <arschmitz> which so far everything is real slow
[07:46:56] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:47:21] <uGoMobi> I wish we had some more insights in the number of people testing alpha
[07:47:37] <uGoMobi> now we don't really know what it means
[07:47:49] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:48:13] <arschmitz> i talked to one person on #jquery that i help a lot and they started testing yesterday they just have not found anything
[07:48:33] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: also commented yesterday he upgraded app hes working on but just has not found any bugs
[07:48:54] <RWhitbeck> IT'S A BURNING WRECK!!!!
[07:48:56] <uGoMobi> yes I saw that
[07:48:59] <RWhitbeck> j/k
[07:49:02] <uGoMobi> :/
[07:49:04] <uGoMobi> lool
[07:49:27] <RWhitbeck> my biggest issue with the alpha is poor docs. 
[07:49:45] <arschmitz> RWhitbeck: yeah we know we are working on that
[07:49:56] <RWhitbeck> I find I go to the source code more then usual to understand something. 
[07:49:58] <arschmitz> the other person i talked to said exact same thing
[07:50:03] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: feel free to commit updates :)
[07:50:25] <RWhitbeck> yeahâ€¦I think that'll probably what I'll work on during the UI/Mobile meeting. 
[08:39:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got changelog working for commits
[08:39:05] <arschmitz> need to add issues
[08:39:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[08:39:20] <uGoMobi> didn't crash on 1500 commits? :)
[08:39:30] <arschmitz> nah only took about 10 seconds
[08:39:38] <uGoMobi> nice
[08:41:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it writes them out in markdown already too so much easier for agcolom
[08:44:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/6283211
[08:45:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's great
[08:46:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can just link to it from the blog post
[08:46:16] <arschmitz> will need manual cleaup for sure but the way its all grouped should make it pretty easy
[08:48:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill work on getting issues added now
[08:48:44] <arschmitz> it adds issue links for commits already but not for closed issues with no commit
[08:48:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have a sublime text add-on to preview markdown?
[08:49:13] <arschmitz> i dont im sure there must be one though
[08:49:34] <uGoMobi> yeah think so too
[08:49:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview
[08:50:16] <uGoMobi> we use slightly adjusted github flavoured markdown on our websites
[08:50:26] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:50:34] <uGoMobi> ok thanks, gonna try that package
[08:54:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: updated to show formated text https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/6283211
[08:54:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the ones that say TICKETREF are ones that do not actually refrence an issue in commit
[08:59:47] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:00:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: might be good to take notes the first time we cleanup manually
[09:00:19] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:00:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we can improve our commit messages and adjust script to it
[09:00:39] <arschmitz> yup for sure
[09:00:59] <arschmitz> the way this outputs right now is identical to ui
[09:01:37] <arschmitz> the issues will be a bit more complicated though
[09:02:18] <arschmitz> because with trac they just request a TSV of all tickets and append at the end. we will use gitub api to pull them in 100 at a time and format them and add them
[09:03:50] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds bit more complicated
[09:04:24] <arschmitz> yeah but should not be bad its just json
[09:05:06] <uGoMobi> this output looks already pretty good
[09:05:23] <arschmitz> yeah mostly need to delete chunks
[09:05:32] <arschmitz> like anything whitespace: or linting:
[09:05:37] <arschmitz> or merg
[09:05:49] <uGoMobi> the ruby script removed the part before the : and added it as heading to the group
[09:05:57] <uGoMobi> but I prefer this
[09:06:09] <uGoMobi> just leave it in place
[09:07:05] <uGoMobi> easier to remove chunks this way
[09:07:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the idea of this is you manually group after so you end up with something like http://jqueryui.com/changelog/1.10.0/
[09:07:54] <uGoMobi> hmm
[09:08:00] <arschmitz> but we need to work on our commit messages before its that simple
[09:10:56] <uGoMobi> yeah that's for sure
[09:11:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they remove the first half of the commit messsage to just leave a ticket fixed or like Added: ....
[09:12:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but thats all manual not part of generation
[09:12:39] <uGoMobi> yeah, the result looks pretty neat
[09:13:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but if we are good with our commit messages i could automate some of that
[13:14:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[13:14:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I am here
[13:15:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got issues working in changelog
[13:15:08] <arschmitz> https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/6283211
[13:15:26] <uGoMobi> was reading the long bower thread 
[13:15:41] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah thats been getting heated today
[13:16:09] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:16:29] <uGoMobi> awesome that you got issues working
[13:17:03] <arschmitz> yeah it still needs some work to turn tags into milestones
[13:17:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think we should keep both the issue and the commit that closed it in the log?
[13:17:38] <arschmitz> because to github api the 1.4.0 issue milestone is actually 20 
[13:17:49] <arschmitz> so just to get it working i hardcoded 20
[13:17:57] <arschmitz> obviously that needs to be fixed
[13:17:58] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that
[13:18:20] <uGoMobi> it's more like an milestone ID
[13:18:26] <arschmitz> yup
[13:18:47] <arschmitz> so i need to write someting to request the milestones and then match the tag with the milestone
[13:19:16] <arschmitz> not a big deal just have not done it yet
[13:19:28] <arschmitz> and as far as issue vs commit
[13:19:29] <uGoMobi> I understand
[13:19:42] <arschmitz> thats something that will have to be manual
[13:19:56] <arschmitz> for now anyway because they are coming from 2 different sources
[13:20:02] <uGoMobi> right
[13:20:14] <uGoMobi> if we want to do that
[13:20:44] <arschmitz> yeah and i can continue working on this once we are past 1.4 and can implement standards for commits 
[13:20:59] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:21:09] <arschmitz> i just want something to start to get us going for 1.4
[13:21:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: like this leaves out a ton of tickets right now
[13:21:53] <arschmitz> because if it was closed without a milestone it wont show up here
[13:22:13] <uGoMobi> of course
[13:22:32] <uGoMobi> I can do a quick check
[13:22:52] <arschmitz> i think at some point this week we should talk about what exactly we want to do for 1.4
[13:22:59] <arschmitz> and ill adapt this for that
[13:23:03] <uGoMobi> you can select issues without milestone
[13:23:10] <arschmitz> yes
[13:23:17] <uGoMobi> then sort on last updated
[13:23:27] <arschmitz> and use a date rather then a milestone for where to start
[13:25:10] <arschmitz> gotta find the day we released 1.3 final lol
[13:25:50] <uGoMobi> you can look for the tag
[13:25:53] <arschmitz> feb 20
[13:26:01] <uGoMobi> right
[13:26:05] <uGoMobi> long time ago :/
[13:26:34] <arschmitz> yeah like 6 months
[13:28:43] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/jg51sg
[13:28:43] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14db6c423 15Gabriel Schulhof: Collapsible: Factor in inherited options for current options as well.
[13:28:43] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 145b42bcc 15Gabriel Schulhof: Integration tests: Collapsible: Make sure that setting the option expandedIcon while the collapsible is expanded removes the old expandedIcon class.
[13:34:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: holy cow adding closed non milestone issues REALLY adds to the issues
[13:35:03] <arschmitz> by like 500
[13:35:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah but that includes all non issues, duplicates, etc.
[13:36:14] <arschmitz> yup
[13:36:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/6283211
[13:36:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was thinking to go through the tickets and add the missing milestone
[13:37:05] <uGoMobi> but just quick scan
[13:37:11] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:38:14] <uGoMobi> can even do a search for the fixed because in most cases we say something like closing as fixed in the last comment
[13:38:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if someone took the time to go through and set milestones and mark fixed or not it would clean this up a TON!
[13:38:29] <uGoMobi> the word fixed*
[13:38:29] <arschmitz> yup
[13:39:04] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:39:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: because i can easily filter based on labels
[13:40:43] <uGoMobi> ok let's try to add that label
[13:41:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we have at least a few weeks before final to try and get through them
[13:41:21] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:41:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: not that she isnt busy already but im sure if it means less work on the changelog agcolom will be happy to help too
[13:42:25] <uGoMobi> i can work on this too
[13:42:44] <arschmitz> yeah i think if all of us can plug away at it it wont be too bad
[13:42:58] <uGoMobi> maybe we won't find all but i am sure we can get far
[13:43:19] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:43:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and we can use 1.4.0 milestone to make sure we dont look at the same ones
[13:43:52] <arschmitz> even if its not fixed set milestone to 1.4.0 and then we can only look at ones with no milestone
[13:43:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, add milestone and label
[13:44:08] <arschmitz> and in changelog ill only pull ones with label
[13:44:10] <uGoMobi> hmm not sure if that's a good idea
[13:44:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: or we could make a custom one to set for now
[13:44:27] <uGoMobi> i think only close as fixed should have milestone
[13:44:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and remove it after
[13:44:34] <uGoMobi> yeah that's better
[13:44:55] <arschmitz> just so that when we are going through we wont be looking at same tickets 3 times
[13:45:06] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:45:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: something iv thought we have been missing for a long time too is a wont fix label
[13:45:21] <arschmitz> and a browser bug label
[13:45:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, I agree
[13:46:15] <arschmitz> cool we should bring it up in metting thursday then we can all get started
[13:46:29] <uGoMobi> had added that already to my notes for "the way we work" meeting
[13:46:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i more meant just going through the old ones
[13:46:51] <arschmitz> but yes for that also
[13:46:57] <uGoMobi> commit messages, labels, branch rebasing etc
[13:47:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[13:47:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, when we have new labels we can also apply them to the 6000+ closed tickets :)
[13:47:51] <arschmitz> lol or maybe just the closed ones without milestones since feb lol
[13:47:58] <uGoMobi> not sure if we need the low medium high etc labels
[13:48:05] <uGoMobi> maybe only high and blocker
[13:48:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats a carry over from trac
[13:48:24] <arschmitz> ui and core both use them on trac
[13:48:40] <uGoMobi> I understand
[13:48:58] <uGoMobi> but we don't really use them, or not consistent
[13:49:10] <uGoMobi> anyway, things to brainstorm about
[13:49:12] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:49:14] <uGoMobi> what works best
[13:49:21] <arschmitz> yup
[13:49:36] <arschmitz> if we keep them we need to use them on every confirmed issue
[13:49:55] <arschmitz> but like you said something to discuss
[13:50:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: at least we have a working changelog for final even if it still needs work
[13:51:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: exactly and thats great, thanks!
[13:51:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: really was not too bad
[13:51:49] <uGoMobi> still nice :)
[13:51:53] <arschmitz> yup
[13:52:11] <arschmitz> and ill keep tweaking it to make it as simple as possible to get the desired final product
[13:52:21] <uGoMobi> great
[13:52:35] <uGoMobi> ok I am off
[13:52:38] <uGoMobi> good night!
[13:52:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one thing
[13:52:47] <uGoMobi> sure
[13:52:47] <arschmitz> ok not important talk to you tomorrow
[13:52:57] <uGoMobi> it's ok
[13:53:10] <arschmitz> ok ui does not do pre-release changelogs at all
[13:53:28] <uGoMobi> and you tell me that now ;)
[13:53:29] <arschmitz> only final
[13:53:56] <arschmitz> :) yeah their script actually aborts with an error saying it does not do pre releases 
[13:54:05] <uGoMobi> something we can reconsider
[13:54:20] <arschmitz> yeah not a biggy either way just thought id mention
[13:54:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have a good night
[13:55:02] <uGoMobi> difference is that they already provide an upgrade guide
[13:55:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[13:55:20] <uGoMobi> so with mobile you kinda needed the changelog to figure out what you need to update
[13:55:26] <arschmitz> something to considder in the future
[13:55:43] <uGoMobi> so if we do that better for next version (have it ready for alpa)
[13:55:45] <uGoMobi> exactly
[13:55:50] <uGoMobi> ok see you tomorrow
