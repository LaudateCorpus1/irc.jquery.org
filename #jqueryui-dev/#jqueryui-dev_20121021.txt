[05:39:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: One more question... do we accept pull requests without tests?
[05:52:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #70: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/70/
[05:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: No, all sites need to be tagged in order to deploy.
[05:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> The stage site is deployed on every commit.
[05:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> We generally want tests for PRs, but if it's a plugin that already has a horrible test suite, we don't worry about it.
[07:41:58] <Wanted1900> It seems like the minified version of the 1.9.0 download isn't properly updated, if you search for (++listId) in the normal version, it finds a result and if you search for the same string in the minified version, there are no results. Is this intended or is it a bug?
[07:44:09] <Wanted1900> I was having the same issue as http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5576 and it should be fixed but it isn't.
[07:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> Wanted1900: You can't expect unminified and minified code to be the same.
[07:48:45] <Wanted1900> I know, I can find where it goes wrong, the minified version has ++t and the normal has (++listId)
[07:49:49] <scott_gonzalez> a+ ++b is perfectly valid code.
[07:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> a+++b is something different, which is what JSMin is talking about.
[07:51:29] <Wanted1900> Yes, I think it was fixed by changing it to (++listId), I'm not sure
[07:51:37] <Wanted1900> The minified version however still has this.cookie=this.options.cookie.name||"ui-tabs-"+ ++t)
[07:52:27] <Wanted1900> So it seems the issue got fixed in the "unminified" version and the issue still exists in the minified version. I just redownloaded the package from the jquery website the problem still exists
[07:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> As I said, "a+ ++b" is valid and does what we want.
[07:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> We cannot produce errors in any browser.
[07:56:45] <Wanted1900> I understand, therefore I didn't create a ticket cause it isn't really a bug (it stills works). But I don't really understand why the normal version uses (++listId) on this line, and the minified version has ++t on that same line. Im talking about line #14270
[07:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because parens are a waste of bytes.
[07:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why you'd expect anything to be the same in the two versions.
[07:58:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi! in the api docs, should all files have an empty line at the end? (or just some of them)
[07:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: All files.
[07:58:25] <agcolom> ok, thanks
[07:58:36] <agcolom> will get that changed...
[07:58:50] <agcolom> (well fixed I mean :-) )
[07:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:01:28] <Wanted1900> My issue here is, I use JSMin for php, it changes a+ ++b to a+++b so it isn't valid anymore. It could be fixed by using parens a+ (++b). That will be minified to a+(++b) and that is still valid. But I also think the issue is a bit on my end as I am minifying an minified script.
[08:03:40] <Wanted1900> Oh let me correct myself: a+++b is interpreted as a++ +b according to their website http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html (See Caution)
[08:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> JSMin is broken.
[08:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> Very clearly.
[08:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, it doesn't make sense for you to minify a minified file.
[08:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> This is a non-issue.
[08:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Use the unminified file and JSMin won't break.
[08:12:52] <Wanted1900> Yes I was already thinking that. I should change my stuff around. But thanks for the help anyway, I learned something :)
[08:23:49] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: in mobile, we have widgets that were created in version 1.0 but some options only came in version 1.2. Do we want to add that in the api doc or we don't worry about it?
[08:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you can do <option name="..." added="1.2">
[08:24:30] <agcolom> oh, thanks!
[08:25:03] <agcolom> missing DC and the much nicer weather!
[08:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> The weather is about the same here :-P
[08:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> Sunny and mid-to-high 70s this week.

[11:43:40] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[11:44:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I think I fixed the 404 on the search for autocomplete
[11:44:39] <gnarf> but now there is another 404 on those demos
[11:44:41] <gnarf> thoughts?
[11:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is that change live?
[11:55:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yes
[11:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still getting 404, plus other 404s that didn't exist before.
[11:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> This actually seems way worse.
[11:57:03] <gnarf> so "source.php" works
[11:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not for me.
[11:57:21] <gnarf> like, whats a 404 that shouldn't be 404'n?
[11:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2X2F3u2m1b3d
[11:58:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/2L3U2B0O1v2e
[11:59:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: this is strange...
[12:06:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just fixed the .css / etc 404's i think
[12:06:42] <gnarf> waiting for it to go live
[12:07:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems good now
[12:07:47] <gnarf> search still 404 for you?
[12:07:50] <gnarf> i'm able to use the demo
[12:07:59] <gnarf> and the "other 404's" died
[12:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> The other 404s are gone, but I'm still getting a 404 on searcch.php
[12:09:07] <gnarf> wtf
[12:09:51] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/2I0q0O0J1Q2X
[12:10:09] <gnarf> i assume the double c was a typo in IRC :)
[12:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:10:34] <gnarf> like, i'm using the demo just fine
[12:10:36] <gnarf> (on live)
[12:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's working for me in Firefox, but not Chrome.
[12:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't make any sense.
[12:10:58] <gnarf> chrome for me
[12:11:09] <gnarf> obvs
[12:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea why it's broken in Chrome for me. It doens't make any sense.
[12:15:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: agree
[12:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> I guess just consider it fixed?
[12:15:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: clear some caches?
[12:15:53] <gnarf> try from browserstack chrome to confirm?
[12:16:20] <jzaefferer> gnarf: its working for me as well

[12:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> 3/4 if you count me on Firefox as a different person :-P
[12:43:20] <ryanneufeld> if seeing json counts as 'fixed' then it seems fixed here

[12:45:56] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8005 seems this is still broken
[12:46:35] <gnarf> re-broken
[12:47:56] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[12:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: It's not still broken. It's a completely new issue.
[12:48:59] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[12:49:17] <ryanneufeld> anything I can do to help?
[12:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's fixable today.
[12:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need to do a new release and add more files to the CDN.

[12:56:47] <gnarf> added the lang to your fiddle

[12:57:17] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: so it seems that the demos don't include those files
[13:52:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: need to remove tabs from the grunt-qunit exclude
[13:59:24] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: FWIW, I think that all pulls should have tests regardless of the state of the rest of the tests. It's even more important for the modules that are getting rewrites soon.
[13:59:44] <mikesherov> But that's just my 2 cents.
[14:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: We're not going to guarantee back compat on the plugins that get rewritten.
[14:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> We're only doing back compat for the plugins that we can salvage existing code from.
[14:01:22] <mikesherov> That's fine. Still would be good to have tests for things that are clearly bugs, no?
[14:01:56] <mikesherov> I was thinking about writing a test suite for datepicker ahead of the rewrite
[14:02:49] <mikesherov> I just feel like a good barrage of tests is an important precursor to a rewrite.
[14:03:01] <mikesherov> Again, just something to think about.
[14:39:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: why is lint so FUBAR on jquery-ui?
[14:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> Are you using the latest grunt?
[14:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> I think that introduced all kinds of issues.
[14:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Correct, the demos don't include the files, and we don't have a good way to include them.

[16:30:33] <mikesherov> gnarf: scott_gonzalez: newest grunt has awesome new JSHint. We need to lock in the latest version and just update defaults
[16:30:40] <mikesherov> I can do that tonight
[16:32:40] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ben_alman cut a new version at the summit. I did the upgrade for core. I can do UI tonigh
[17:14:48] <jzaefferer> ?tell nacin scott_gonzalez: found my grunt-wordpress issue. Turns out nginx has a client_max_body_size setting, limiting uploads to 1mb. Removed that limit locally, now its all good again. Debugging that was pretty annoying with the way the xml-rpc module doesn't handle invalid responses

[18:46:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: oh hi!
[18:46:41] <kborchers> jzaefferer: i responded on the PR
[18:46:52] <jzaefferer> ah, good
[18:46:53] <jzaefferer> looking
[18:47:17] <jzaefferer> kborchers: what's this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/738/files#L0R16
[18:48:15] <kborchers> jzaefferer: hmmm, thought i killed that … i think i removed code that used that option and forgot to remove the option. i'll fix it tonight
[18:48:36] <kborchers> oh that's just the demo … i
[18:48:37] <kborchers> ll fix it
[18:48:42] <jzaefferer> kborchers: other then that, I'm for just using the animated gif; the two people that want something better can just use their own gif
[18:49:03] <kborchers> jzaefferer: sounds good … i can knock all of that out tonight
[18:50:33] <jzaefferer> kborchers: alright. I talked to Scott about it, he wants to take another look at the code.
[18:51:00] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok … i'll kill the option from the demo and wait until i hear from scott then
[18:51:21] <jzaefferer> kborchers: btw. you're acid green in Scott's IRC client, dunno what says about your relationship :p
[18:52:00] <kborchers> heh … it's his way of easily filtering out msgs from me i suppose :)
[18:52:28] <kborchers> jzaefferer: why are you up right now? u still in the US?
[18:52:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers: sitting next to Scott at his house
[18:52:48] <kborchers> ah nice

[18:55:52] <jzaefferer> kborchers: we'll hack on the dialog redesign till Thursday night, flying back home on Friday
[18:57:34] <kborchers> jzaefferer: cool, feel so behind and out of the loop after being off the grid for a week
[18:57:54] <kborchers> it was nice but now so much catching up to do on lots of stuff
[18:59:58] <jzaefferer> kborchers: missed you at the summit. But also looking forward to getting 1.10 real soon
[19:01:20] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, really wished i could have been there but had a good time in disney with the family. how soon are we looking at for 1.10? sooner than dialog by dec 1 and release jan 1?
[19:02:43] <jzaefferer> That's still the goal, though I really want to get dialog as done as possible this week; my schedule isn't looking great for UI beyond that, and Scott will probably get bogged down into all the thousand little issues we're dealing with each day
[19:03:20] <jzaefferer> Selectmenu is really close, Menubar and Effects can wait for 1.11...
[19:05:21] <kborchers> jzaefferer: sounds good … are we going to discuss moving things around in this week's meeting possibly? i'm writing my what's new and what's coming in UI talk for jqcon asia so would like to be as accurate as possible on what is coming when
[19:07:08] <jzaefferer> kborchers: yeah, we can do that

[19:07:26] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] CSS: Apply opacity to absolutely positioned ui icons in IE8.  Fixed #6059 - Button: Primary icon "enabled" when button is disabled. - TJ VanToll
[19:07:30] <kborchers> jzaefferer: cool, thanks
[19:07:53] <jzaefferer> for now, 1.10 will include dialog and whatever else gets done in time. Felix is quite invested in getting Selectmenu done, so that should happen.
[19:08:31] <jzaefferer> The rest of the roadmap is likely to change. I really don't think we should include more new components before we cleaned up everything that's already in a stable release, including datepicker and the interactions.
[19:09:12] <kborchers> jzaefferer: that sounds reasonable though you know people prefer to hear about new over improved :)
[19:10:30] <kborchers> kind of like "Oh cool, a new menu widget. Wait! You fixed accordion and now i have to change my code? WTF?!?!" :D
[19:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: True, but this will just get us closer to "OH SHIT NEW INTERACTIONS THAT WORK ON TOUCH!!!!1111"
[19:11:32] <kborchers> "a mysterious scott_gonzalez appears"
[19:11:34] <kborchers> :)
[19:11:45] <kborchers> but yeah, for sure!
[19:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[19:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> We're one ticket away from being down to 700...
[19:12:00] <jzaefferer> kborchers: right… I guess we should do more stuff like bright orange background colors. Give them something obvious to complain about. Set up a trough, and the pigs will come...
[19:12:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: nice!
[19:12:58] <kborchers> jzaefferer: heh
[19:13:45] <jzaefferer> only DaveMethvin puts "very" in front of "ancient"...
[19:13:57] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/17#issuecomment-9650795
[19:14:47] <kborchers> as opposed to a little ancient
[19:15:06] <jzaefferer> kborchers: so Scott is on vacation next week, then moving, there's thanksgiving… we really need to get 1.10 done THIS WEEK
[19:15:39] <kborchers> wow
[19:16:02] <kborchers> i'll be on my trip to korea for almost a week too

[20:03:59] <azbyin> hi all.. is there a page where I can download a customised jqueryui 1.8.24? the current custom download is for jqui-1.9
[20:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> azbyin: old.jqueryui.com/download, but why?
[20:06:40] <azbyin> oh, thank you scott_gonzalez
[20:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> azbyin: Why are you downloading 1.8.24 instead of 1.9.0?
[20:09:27] <azbyin> i believe we already had this discussion a few days back.. accordion supporting non-standard layout :)
[20:12:25] <azbyin> and while i'm here.. how do you access the index of the panel that was activated?  previously with 1.8.x i had this:  $("#myacc").bind("accordionchange",function(ui,event){ console.log(ui.options.active); });
[20:13:26] <azbyin> and there is no ui.options with 1.9.x and i actually had to do console.log($(this).accordion("option", "active"));  within the callback
[20:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[20:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> ui.options doesn't make sense to expose, since it's always exposed via the widget.
[20:14:12] <azbyin> is that the preferred way? I kind of liked the old way because you don;t need make another jquery selector call
[20:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's the preferred way.
[20:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> `$( this )` is super fast, if that's your concern.
[20:16:18] <azbyin> ok, thanks. just wanted to verify that.
[20:16:23] <azbyin> indeed, that was my concern
[20:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> You can also just do:
[20:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> accordion = $( "#myacc" )...
[20:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> and then use `accordion` instead of `$( this )`
[20:17:31] <azbyin> yes, thats what i was planning to do and then i hit that accordion layout strangeness
[20:18:45] <azbyin> also, is there a way to do some automated analysis to find out which bits of jquery and jquery-ui are actually being used? because right now i'm trying to trim as many bytes as possible from my site
[20:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> CCAO?
[20:19:26] <azbyin> what is CCAO? i'm unaware of this abbreviation
[20:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> Closure Compiler Advanced Optimizations
[20:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3
[20:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> But jQuery and jQuery UI don't have the necessary info to run through CCAO.
[20:21:05] <azbyin> ah, i thought it would be a generic tool
[20:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> That is the best way to get just the code you use though.
[20:21:25] <azbyin> i'm using openlayers, and the openlayers.js file is 957KB !
[20:21:50] <azbyin> so i want to trim off *all* files that i'm serving on the page
[20:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, I have no idea what happens when you run without an externs list.
[20:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think if you want to just throw everything into a single file at the end, you'll be fine.
[20:23:18] <scott_gonzalez> And you'll probably savea ton of bytes.
[20:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're relying on creating any globals at all, you'll get in trouble.
[20:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> See https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3#export
[20:27:23] <azbyin> right, i'll give it a go. thanks again scott_gonzalez
[20:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
