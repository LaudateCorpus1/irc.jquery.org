[08:53:50] <kborchers> jzaefferer: thanks for the input on those commits/PR's. Any thoughts on following those anchors with keyboard nav without focusing the anchor? I can get it working just fine but I would like to honor target="_blank" in the anchors but to open a new window with JS will trip popup blockers
[08:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> just landed 1.6.2 in master :-)
[08:54:29] <kborchers> yay!!!
[08:57:03] <gnarf> nice!
[08:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> ran unit tests for everything except interactions in latest Chrome, Firefox, Opera and IE 6
[08:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> than ran all interaction demos in Chrome and IE 6
[08:58:18] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you around?
[09:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? http://jsfiddle.net/r6zFU/1/ dies in IE 7
[09:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> it has to be two calls to .removeAttr()
[09:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> and that .find() call has to come first
[09:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> so odd
[12:33:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you lurkin?
[12:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:34:06] <gnarf> where did you suggest trying to hook in that hide/show test?
[12:34:35] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer suggested the tooltip test suite
[12:34:47] * gnarf apologizes 
[12:34:50] <gnarf> got wrong person
[12:34:53] <gnarf> but thanks for remembering
[12:34:54] <gnarf> :)
[12:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be fine with the test suite for any widget that's calling those methods
[12:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> no problem :-)
[12:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> I had written that line item with accordion animations in mind (which don't use show/hide)
[12:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> since that's the only thing missing from the accordion test suite
[12:35:59] <gnarf> heh
[12:36:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: _core or _methods?
[12:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> for tooltip, probably core
[12:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think it'll end up being widget dependent
[12:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> like in dialog it would go in methods
[12:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> since you have to go through the open/close methods to get the animations
[12:38:07] <gnarf> i'm prolly gonna leverage open/close on tooltip too
[12:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> so put it in methods then :-P
[12:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> actually....
[12:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> put it in options
[12:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> since we're testing the option, not the method
[12:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> and amazingly, when it's in the right place, it'll be consistent across all widgets
[12:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> because I never feel like dealing with Firefox and it's unholy fractional pixels, does anyone object to me just sticking a +1 between these parens? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L438
[12:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> sometimes we end up 1px too small and words end up wrapping in Firefox
[12:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm assuming we're actually <1px off
[12:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have any proof that this is a sub-pixel issue, but it's only Firefox and 1px fixes it
[13:37:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: +1
[13:37:53] <jzaefferer> gnarf, now I'm here, for a bit
[13:46:04] <Argorok> http://www.wancorarh.com.br/spa_admin/ -> Can anyone help me with this? In the second tab: clientes, my accordion is very small, I wanna that every accordion display all content when expanded, like occurs in first tab, laborat躁ios.

[20:08:47] <gnarf> I'm sure there is more api than just that to test tho
[20:09:10] <gnarf> im done for the night, leave me a message if you have an opinion on those tests :)
[20:09:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ read that in the mornin (or later ;) )
