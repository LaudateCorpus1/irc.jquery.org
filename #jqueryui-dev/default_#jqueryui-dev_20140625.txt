[06:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I assume it was a concious decision to use <pre> instead of fences for http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.11/#simplified-custom-and-quick-downloads (presumably to avoid the background color)?
[06:13:17] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: correct
[06:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Do you think this really belongs in the upgrade guide? http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.11/#only-remove-hover-and-focus-class-names-when-disabling-not-enabling
[06:36:29] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: nah
[06:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> Can you review https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/86

[06:44:22] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I'm reviewing it now.
[07:00:47] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I'm all set with the upgrade guide. The changes look good.
[07:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> I've made all the edits already.
[07:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll squash and push.

[07:57:27] <jperrault> with respect to http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7841, does the jQuery Foundation have access to (free) copies of JAWS for testing purposes?
[08:17:30] <tj_vantoll> jperrault: Not that I know of. But JAWS has a demo mode you can run for free for 45 minutes. (Then you have to reboot the machine and you can do it again.)
[08:19:12] <jperrault> tj_vantoll thanks.  that's a bit of a pain, especially for those of us with whole-disk encryption.  no wonder 7841 is three years old... :-)
[08:20:49] <jperrault> has anyone from the jQuery foundation considered approach them (Freedom Scientific) about getting a limited dev license?
[08:32:12] <tj_vantoll> jperrault: Not that I'm aware of.
[08:32:36] <tj_vantoll> fyi the button widget is in the process of being rewritten.
[08:32:47] <tj_vantoll> Which is the main reason why that ticket has not been addressed.
[08:32:50] <arschmitz> jperrault: that is actually fixed in the re-write
[08:33:43] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: ^^
[08:33:55] <tj_vantoll> Ah cool.
[08:35:27] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: checkboxes no longer use role button 
[08:35:35] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: jperrault: since they are not buttons
[08:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> jperrault: As far as I know, they don't give out testing licenses to anyone.
[08:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> Freedom Scientific doesn't like anyone using anything but a paid version.
[08:44:51] <jperrault> thanks.  was just looking through the list of 1.12 issues.
[09:14:52] <CAmato> Does anyone know how to set the default configuration for Jquery Mobile to not use rounded corners on everything? 
[09:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> CAmato: Support is in #jquery
[09:16:28] <CAmato> thx

[09:45:24] <arschmitz> gschulhof: gseguin: jasperdegroot: Ping!
[09:45:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: pong
[09:46:28] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: can you delete your dist folder locally and run grunt test and tell me if you get a css folder inside dist/demos/
[09:46:37] <gseguin> yo
[09:46:53] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: sure, will do that now
[09:48:14] <arschmitz> gseguin: unless im missing something or crazy the css has not been getting copied and things were only working because it already existed in all our clones and the casper tests were not actually checking the dist demos 
[09:48:33] * gseguin is flabbergasted by http://goo.gl/chXzM3
[09:49:01] <arschmitz> gseguin: just realized because i deleted my dist folder and things went very bad lol
[09:49:06] <gseguin> arschmitz: I can't look at it now
[09:49:15] <arschmitz> gseguin: no need i just pinged everyone
[09:49:27] <arschmitz> to get someone else to verify that the folder is not being created
[09:49:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: jasperdegroot is doing it now
[09:53:09] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: tests are still running, but I suppose it should have been created already by now
[09:53:24] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes if its to unit tests it would be done
[09:53:50] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: do you mean dist/demos/css/ ?
[09:53:56] <arschmitz> yes
[09:54:10] <jasperdegroot> don't see it
[09:55:07] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: do you see any css files in dist at all?
[09:55:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: nope, only the JS
[09:56:01] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: ok thanks
[09:56:12] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: when I open a demo page I get an unstyled page
[09:56:16] <arschmitz> wow its a good thing i started looking at demos
[09:56:26] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah for sure
[09:56:37] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah this has been working on demos and local because dist is never cleaned
[09:56:43] <arschmitz> so it worked at a point 
[09:56:46] <arschmitz> and was broken
[09:56:54] <arschmitz> but we never realized
[09:57:05] <jasperdegroot> :(
[09:57:55] <arschmitz> yeah we need to make the tests delete the dist folder at the beginning of every run to make sure this does not happen
