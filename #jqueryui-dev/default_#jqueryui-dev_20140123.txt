[00:11:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: /window 3
[00:11:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry :)
[00:17:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Autogrow with a large textarea is unusable on Android 2.3.5 native browser ... the very act of trying to place the caret causes it to scroll.
[00:19:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: What scrolls exactly?
[00:20:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Do you get a scrollbar inside the textarea or does the page with the textarea on it scroll to top?
[00:20:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The whole page.
[00:21:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The sizing works, but it keeps scrolling
[00:21:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll check to see if there's a scroll event I can eat.
[00:24:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: So you see the same problem as on desktop browsers except that you don't actually need to type something, but just placing the caret already triggers the jump?
[00:24:53] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[00:25:18] <_|Nix|_> ... and preventing default on the scroll event doesn't help ...
[00:26:28] <_|Nix|_> The only way that works is to save the scrollTop and restore it, but that's an ugly jump every time you type a character.
[00:47:10] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... adding a div next to the textarea works perfectly, but on Android 2.3.5 you can't type anymore. It doesn't jump, but the typed character is not added to the textarea. It's as if it was read-only. WTF?!
[00:47:47] <_|Nix|_> ... and it's not like I'm creating a new div every time. No. I add the div during create, and I change its height every time, before setting the height of the textarea to 0.
[00:51:08] <_|Nix|_> OK. Woah ... you can't type into the textarea at all. Not even if I don't make any changes.
[00:54:19] <_|Nix|_> OK. This is super-weird ...
[00:56:57] <_|Nix|_> Wow! OK. So, On Android 2.3.5 native browser you can't type into the textarea from http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/65/ even if you turn off jQuery Mobile and everything. It's like, if there's too much text, it won't let you type anymore.
[00:57:17] <_|Nix|_> So, I think that's an Android bug.
[00:59:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6898.html - no more jumping when there's a div next to the textarea that is in-flow and has the same height as the textarea.
[01:00:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's no jumping on Android 2.3.5 either, but, of course, on Android 2.3.5 you can only press backspace. You can't type any new text - but that's Android's fault, I think.
[01:03:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice
[01:04:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I still wanna test on iOS and WP, but it's not bad ... and if the textarea is out of flow, well, then the height doesn't much matter ...
[01:04:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's test http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/65 on Android 2.3.5 without the listview and wrapped in a form
[01:04:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[01:05:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6898-2.html
[01:06:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope. Can't type.
[01:06:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Turning off all libraries and stylesheets ...
[01:07:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still can't type.
[01:07:29] <_|Nix|_> Turned libraries and stylesheets back on.
[01:08:12] <_|Nix|_> Dang nab it ... it still scrolls ...
[01:08:21] <_|Nix|_> ... whenever you touch the textarea.
[01:09:02] <_|Nix|_> Works fine in Chrome/desktop though.
[01:09:29] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'm going to grab some lunch. BBIAB.

[04:15:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think the adding-a-div thing works fine everywhere else, and is no worse on Android 2.3.5 than not doing the adding-a-div thing.
[04:16:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, but we have to do a lot of testing to avoid new regressions
[04:17:44] <uGoMobi> things like textarea inside a collapsible and inside a popup
[04:18:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NM :( WP7.5 scrolls :(
[04:18:28] <_|Nix|_> I don't get it. It wasn't doing it before.
[04:18:39] <uGoMobi> I never saw an issue about textarea not working at all on Android 2.3.5
[04:19:04] <uGoMobi> makes me wonder if it did work before
[04:19:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing about not being able to type into a textarea is not jQM related.
[04:19:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I tried it with just a simple textarea, and no joy.
[04:20:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know, but I am sure that users would have reported it anyway
[04:21:59] <uGoMobi> I am charging Android 2.3 devices now
[04:24:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sounds ominous - like there's an impending onslaught of Android testing rumbling at the horizon.
[04:25:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well, only 2 devices ;-)
[04:25:36] <uGoMobi> not really a big army
[04:27:05] <_|Nix|_> I'm a bit perplexed ... http://jsbin.com/aSUBOsEp/2 produces a really tiny textarea ...
[04:28:51] <_|Nix|_> I'm an idiot ... cols="40" rows="8" ...
[04:30:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think the default for cols is 20
[04:31:24] <_|Nix|_> OK. I don't get it. I'm never working from the office again ... seriously ... all my devices behave differently in the office than at home ...
[04:31:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: jsbin.com/aSUBOsEp/2/ you can type text just fine.
[04:34:45] <_|Nix|_> OK ... FML ... WTF is the difference between http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/112/ and jsbin.com/aSUBOsEp/2/
[04:37:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: besides the label, I only see a difference in meta charset
[04:38:18] <_|Nix|_> Right. In one the meta tag is not closed, whereas in the other it's self-closed.
[04:38:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and missing ""
[04:38:40] <_|Nix|_> Right, true.
[04:57:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The inability to type in new text seems to be related to the length of the text. If I paste in 12 paragraphs of lorem ipsum, you can still type. If I paste in 15 paragraphs, you can no longer type.
[04:59:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The bug report contains 15 paragraphs, so that's why you can no longer type.
[05:02:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh ok, then let's just test with 12 paragraphs
[05:03:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[05:04:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what I'm doing. Without the <ul><li>, it seems to be OK on WP7.5 and WP8, and it's no worse that no change at all on Android 2.3.5.
[05:04:24] <_|Nix|_> Testing iOS 6.0.1 now, but I suspect it'll be OK.
[05:06:44] <_|Nix|_> iOS 6.0.1 is OK.
[05:07:13] <_|Nix|_> When I mean "is OK", I mean it doesn't scroll away when you're trying to type.
[05:07:38] <_|Nix|_> Gah ... When I /say/ "is OK" ...
[05:09:12] <_|Nix|_> FF and Chrome/desktop don't scroll either ...

[05:58:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... interesting. I'm trying to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6700 while I'm at it, and I'm noticing that the textarea initially shrinks! That is, we compute a height for the text area that is less than the height it gets by default.
[05:58:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've slowed down the transition so you can really see the effect.
[05:58:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/6700.html
[06:01:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, that was a downside from making it work
[06:01:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's first decide if it's a bug
[06:01:41] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6700#issuecomment-28813285
[06:01:53] <uGoMobi> right now it's a closed ticket
[06:02:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think its a bug we chose to do that annoying or not
[06:02:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^
[06:02:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I can decide to short-circuit if the computed height is smaller than the original height.
[06:02:40] <arschmitz> may have been a bad choice granted
[06:03:06] <uGoMobi> right, we can reconsider but then it's something for 1.5 or later
[06:07:02] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that also reflects the code changes involved.
[06:07:35] <_|Nix|_> If you want to animate from non-zero, you cannot just tack on the animation class. You need to first restore the size from 0 to whatever it was without animation, and then you need to animate the rest of the way.
[06:08:10] <_|Nix|_> So, the size goes like this: initial -> 0 -> initial --animate--> desired
[06:08:40] <_|Nix|_> And I'll add the never-ever-shrink code.
[06:10:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: never shrink code?
[06:11:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If ( calculatedHeight < currentHeight ) { return }
[06:12:08] <arschmitz> why would you do that?
[06:12:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So it doesn't shrink.
[06:12:21] <arschmitz> its supposed to shrink??
[06:12:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, it's not.
[06:12:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's autogrow, not autoresize.
[06:12:37] <arschmitz> yes it is its not just autogrow any more
[06:12:38] <_|Nix|_> AFAIK
[06:12:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it is
[06:12:45] <arschmitz> no that was 1.3
[06:12:46] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK.
[06:12:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we added autoshrink as feature in 1.4
[06:12:59] <_|Nix|_> Name is confusing.
[06:13:00] <arschmitz> this entire seperation and rewirte was to make it shrink
[06:13:11] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:13:12] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:13:16] <_|Nix|_> NM. Code's gone.
[06:13:54] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, now it's no longer animating from 0.
[06:13:55] <uGoMobi> I really think we should stick to bug fixes and not try to slightly improve autogrow
[06:13:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: autogrow is just what we always called it and we didnt change name
[06:14:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're right. I'm not going to submit this change.
[06:14:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm gonna keep it for after 1.4.1.
[06:14:33] <uGoMobi> we can look into it again for new version
[06:14:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But it's built on top of the scroll fix.
[06:15:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or rather, I noticed it because I was working on the scroll fix and you or arschmitz pointed me to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6700
[06:15:24] <uGoMobi> but then we first after make a document that describes exactly how it suppose to work, known issues we need to avoid, etc.
[06:15:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[06:15:50] <uGoMobi> huh, why did I type "after"? :/
[06:15:58] <uGoMobi> ... first have to ...
[06:16:00] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:16:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I understood nevertheless.
[06:16:56] <_|Nix|_> I'll keep the commit around ...

[06:25:40] <_|Nix|_> Holy cow - we're going through both code climate and travis now ... wow!
[06:27:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do we wanna fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6898 for 1.4.1? I sent the PR, but maybe it's not something we wanna fix after all.
[06:27:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: i.e., should I milestone it for 1.4.1?
[06:28:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: It is unintended behaviour, so it is a bug
[06:29:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: however, "We should test this change extensively."
[06:29:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to be extra careful with tricky changes in maintenance releases
[06:30:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[06:30:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, AFAICT it's no worse than before.
[06:30:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it's better in a lot of places.
[06:30:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if we tested various use cases and don't see problems I am fine with landing this in 1.4.1
[06:32:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I'll milestone it.
[06:32:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've added a functional test: tests/functional/large-autogrow-textarea.html
[06:33:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wonder if that shows up on view.
[06:33:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - I don't know what others think but I prefer explanations and warnings in GitHub comments instead of in the commit message
[06:33:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that should become available in the branche preview

[06:34:33] <uGoMobi> great
[06:34:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I'd argue the opposite, because git is much more searchable than github.

[08:06:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[08:06:55] <gseguin> mornin' all
[08:07:01] <arschmitz> morning
[08:35:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[08:36:06] <arschmitz> trying to figure out how to fix a test thought you might have an idea
[08:36:22] <arschmitz> to test swipe we use the mockabs
[08:36:38] <arschmitz> so when we check offset it gives us adjusted cords
[08:36:54] <_|Nix|_> Right ...
[08:37:22] <arschmitz> but if i change swipe vertical offset to be smaller then what is needed to trigger
[08:37:25] <arschmitz> or the same
[08:37:43] <arschmitz> it fails to work because you can only set one change no seperate ones
[08:38:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you mean that the mocked version of abs returns the same value no matter the input?
[08:38:21] <arschmitz> because the horizontal and vertical offset will always be the same
[08:38:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what its meant to do
[08:38:54] <arschmitz> but that assumption breaks when we change swipe defaults
[08:39:18] <arschmitz> because to sucessfully trigger a swipe vertical offset must be less then horizontal one
[08:39:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see it.
[08:39:38] <arschmitz> and using mockabs they are allways equal
[08:40:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, what we need to do is to modify mockAbs to accept an array of values, and return successive array members upon each successive call.
[08:40:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way we can mock a sequence of calls to abs().
[08:40:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and in handleSwipe() there are two.
[08:40:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or
[08:41:00] <arschmitz> do things the right way
[08:41:09] <arschmitz> you should never modify something in a test and not reset it
[08:41:18] <arschmitz> thats why there are module setup and teardown methods
[08:42:41] <_|Nix|_> Yes, of course, I was not suggesting we change the way we use mockAbs. I was suggesting we modify the implementation of the mocked abs() function.
[08:42:52] <_|Nix|_> Although event_core.js does things the wrong way.
[08:43:04] <arschmitz> right we need to fix that first
[08:43:05] <_|Nix|_> It unmocks the abs in setup() and then re-mocks it some other way.
[08:43:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There are many things to fix in event_core.js. One of them is that it uses .bind() in a lot of places where it should use .one()
[08:43:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have a commit about that.
[08:43:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can push it to a branch.
[08:43:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but this is breaking something right now those arnt :)
[08:44:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's right.
[08:44:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so let's mock in setup and unmock in teardown.
[08:45:06] <arschmitz> next issue is how to get that test to work still
[08:45:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: And, independently of that, we can extend mockAbs to also accept an array, in which case it returns successive values upon successive calls.
[08:45:20] <arschmitz> will have to mock the event object or something
[08:45:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why are we mocking abs at all though why dont we just trigger the event with an event object we make with proper values
[08:46:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I know why.
[08:46:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's because the event handlers are not accessible, and you don't want to pass the event all the way through the dispatch/bubble system.
[08:47:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Mocking abs is a sure-fire way of getting it to behave the way you would expect.
[08:47:36] <arschmitz> good enough i guess
[08:47:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... I guess you're right though, because the tests themselves .trigger( "touchmove" ), etc.
[08:48:14] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:48:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could instead .trigger( touchMoveEvent ) where you create the event object yourself ...
[08:48:29] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:48:34] <arschmitz> that was my thought
[08:48:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But I think for the time being this would be a less invasive change.
[08:48:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We can worry about doing things differently when we fix everything else that's wrong with event_core.js
[08:49:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was thinking just use the events in the crazy swipe function test thing
[08:49:22] <arschmitz> instead of mock
[08:49:32] <arschmitz> but to do that mock needs to be back to normal
[08:49:51] <arschmitz> leave all the other tests for now
[08:50:58] <arschmitz> make swipeTimedTest accept instead of just opts.coordChange to accept an x and y change
[08:51:06] <arschmitz> and use these on the trigger
[08:51:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we could do that.
[08:52:26] <arschmitz> anyway we can discuss more letter gotta run for a few minutes
[08:52:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Me too :) Let's talk after the meeting.

[12:10:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : I have to go now but we can talk about page events vs. pagecontainer events tomorrow
[12:10:31] <uGoMobi> maybe we need to add some demos
[12:12:14] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #232: Pagecontainer events: Clarify that they are emitted on the pagecontainer, not the page 02http://git.io/4MQnkA
[12:12:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oops ... I jumped the gun :)
[12:12:38] <_|Nix|_> Well, we can always close that issue if it proves inaccurate.
[12:12:47] <_|Nix|_> I also have to go. L8R!
[12:42:42] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz: _|Nix|_: in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-FEBk1RkeWjsuwVztwYiqfdFN_993iwOrdHvgbI0Oc/edit is the idea to document the structure?
[12:43:42] <agcolom> so for api docs, we have the xml entries in entries and assets/examples in resources?
[12:46:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: No, this not about the structure that grunt-wordpress expects.
[12:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's a list of components.
[12:46:37] <agcolom> oh
[12:46:53] <agcolom> and what is the purpose of this doc?
[12:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> For sites, the component usually matches the filename without the extension.
[12:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> They were trying to list out the components because there was confusion about what to use in commit messages.
[12:47:37] <agcolom> oh, ok, thx
[12:48:12] <agcolom> so that was so that the changelog gets the correct info?
[12:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but it also applies to projects that don't get changelogs, like sites.
[12:50:50] <agcolom> yes, sure, so should I complete the api doc section?
[12:51:04] <scott_gonzalez> It'd end up essentially be a duplicate of what's above.
[12:51:23] <agcolom> yes
[12:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what they're doing with the document at this point.
[12:52:05] <agcolom> right, ok. I don't think I'll have time today anyway (still in the middle of helping with science homework!)
[13:01:07] <arschmitz> agcolom: the doc was really just to formalize it and make issues in github from it 
[13:01:16] <arschmitz> dont worry about it for other sites there is no need
[13:03:07] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, thx :-)
