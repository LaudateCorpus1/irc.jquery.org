[04:02:29] <skdsuraj1> I was having some nickname clash :( couldn't fix it so added 1 to my nickname 
[04:21:27] <kumarrishav_> hey arschmitz 
[04:22:09] <kumarrishav_> hey arschmitz :
[04:22:11] <kumarrishav_> hey arschmitz:
[04:32:10] <kumarrishav_> kumarrishav_: 
[04:34:01] <arthurvr> Hi kumarrishav_! Do you have any questions? arschmitz isnâ€™t around atm, but somebody else might be able to help.
[04:35:36] <skdsuraj1> Hi arthurvr !  jzaefferer didn't reply
[04:35:36] <kumarrishav_> thanks arthurvr . I wanted to discuss this issue https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96
[04:36:42] <arthurvr> kumarrishav_: Do you have any questions in specific? If you didnâ€™t do that yet, you might be interested in reading https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students as well.
[04:38:03] <kumarrishav_> ok arthurvr will got through this.  thanks
[04:38:18] <arthurvr> Youâ€™re welcome, kumarrishav_!
[04:39:04] <arthurvr> skdsuraj1: He will just come back later. You might have said it already, but did you have any questions in specific?
[04:44:03] <skdsuraj1> How do i get started on the slider re-write project ?
[04:46:01] <arthurvr> skdsuraj1: Youâ€™ve read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students yet? Also, itâ€™s a good idea to start familiarizing yourself with the codebase and the current implementation of the slider.
[04:49:34] <skdsuraj1> yup I have read it arthurvr
[04:50:06] <skdsuraj1> I have also learnt jquery from learn.jquery.com
[04:51:26] <arthurvr> Good to hear! Maybe, just to get familiar with jQuery UI and its codebase, you should try to take an easy ticket? Or did you do that already? (I probably canâ€™t help you any further, you will need the coach)
[04:53:00] <arthurvr> skdsuraj1: ^
[04:53:31] <skdsuraj1> I will fix a small bug now
[04:53:44] <skdsuraj1> thanks arthurvr and sorry to keep bugging you
[04:54:09] <arthurvr> Great!
[04:54:20] <arthurvr> Youâ€™re welcome skdsuraj1!
[04:55:17] <skdsuraj1> what do you mean by the coach ?
[04:55:28] <arthurvr> menter, misworded it

[10:10:19] <sambuddhabasu1> can someone help me get started with QUnit?
[10:16:47] <sambuddhabasu1> i want to participate in GSoC and the QUnit projects look pretty interesting
[10:16:52] <sambuddhabasu1> can someone help me get started?
[10:25:51] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: Start with reading https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students :))
[10:26:20] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: then go take a look at contribute.jquery.org. It contains many useful information regarding contributing.
[10:26:50] <sambuddhabasu1> thanks arthurvr ,will have a look them
[11:24:30] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: are you looking after the jquery UI projects?
[11:32:15] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: I also saw, 'jQuery UI - new demo system' project which lacks in the site
[11:39:02] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: You might need to talk to the mentor about this. Iâ€™m not that envolved with jQuery UI, so canâ€™t give much more information about this.
[11:39:29] <sambuddhabasu1> alright arthurvr , will do that
[11:40:25] <sambuddhabasu1> jzaefferer: arschmitz ping
[11:41:07] <arschmitz> sambuddhabasu1: Hi not all of that issue can be worked on yet
[11:41:29] <arschmitz> but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more
[11:42:50] <sambuddhabasu1> arschmitz: what do you mean by not all of that issue can be worked on yet?
[11:43:18] <sambuddhabasu1> I read jzaefferer comment on the https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96, that it is not important right now
[11:43:59] <arschmitz> sambuddhabasu1: the jsbin integration cannot be worked on yet
[11:45:20] <sambuddhabasu1> arschmitz: does that mean that it wont be one of the GSoC project?
[11:46:43] <sambuddhabasu1> scott_gonzalez: hello, I read your comment
[12:15:11] <sambuddhabasu1> arschmitz: I have been following these steps https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/README.md
[12:15:19] <sambuddhabasu1> and im stuck at vagrant up step
[12:15:26] <sambuddhabasu1> can you help me out?
[12:15:29] <sambuddhabasu1> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:15:30] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: whatâ€™s going wrong?
[12:15:39] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: is it throwing any error?
[12:16:18] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: no, it shows that Virtualbox VM is already running
[12:16:23] <sambuddhabasu1> but i can access it through my browser
[12:19:18] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: alright, its working now, I had to kill the process and start it again
[12:26:26] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: can you help me get a local copy of jqueryui.com ?
[12:26:55] <sambuddhabasu1> i tried the steps mentioned by using vagrant, and now when I go to vagrant.jquery.com
[12:27:11] <arthurvr> Sure I can. You just need a jquery-wp-content instance and a clone of https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com
[12:27:36] <sambuddhabasu1> yes I did clone both the repos
[12:28:12] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: Is the wordpress setup already working?
[12:28:23] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: yes the wordpress setup is already working
[12:28:27] <arthurvr> Sure.
[12:28:58] <sambuddhabasu1> now, when i go to the jqueryui.com repo, i made the config.json file
[12:29:02] <arthurvr> Now go in the jqueryui.com folder and copy config-sample.json to config.json
[12:29:16] <arthurvr> okay. Now go fill it out with your wordpress login data
[12:29:44] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: did that too, on grunt deploy, I get this error, 'npm ERR! missing: download.jqueryui.com@2.0.23, required by jqueryui.com@1.11.16'
[12:30:09] <arthurvr> you ran â€˜npm installâ€™ before running grunt deploy?
[12:30:41] <sambuddhabasu1> I missed that step sorry
[12:31:08] <arthurvr> okay. So if you run `npm install` and then `grunt deploy` again?
[12:36:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Ping!
[12:37:09] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: is your issue fixed?
[12:38:33] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: trying it
[12:44:05] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: I get this error, 'npm WARN package.json download.jqueryui.com@2.0.23 No repository field.'
[12:44:11] <sambuddhabasu1> on running npm install
[12:44:19] <arthurvr> yeah but donâ€™t care about that :)
[12:44:29] <arthurvr> just go forward and run grunt deploy.
[12:45:34] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: on running grunt deploy, i get this error now, http://pastebin.com/ayBnXGDV
[12:46:59] <arthurvr> Hmmmâ€¦ did npm install totally completed?
[12:47:39] <sambuddhabasu1> this is the output of my npm install, http://pastebin.com/RWqqu53P
[12:48:25] <arthurvr> oh that makes sense. You will need to update grunt.
[12:51:50] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: updating grunt is possible by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`
[13:10:37] <sambuddhabasu1> arthurvr: even after updating grunt, the same issue continues
[13:11:08] <arthurvr> Thatâ€™s weird. Could we try with `npm install grunt-cli@latest`?
[13:11:29] <arthurvr> Whoops, should be `npm install -g grunt-cli@latest`
[13:14:27] <saurabhmishra> Hello everyone, My name is Saurabh Mishra and I am a 3rd year graduate student pursuing Information Technology(B.Tech.)  in IIIT-Allahabad , India.
[13:14:42] <saurabhmishra> I am highly interested  in project "new demo system"  of jquery-UI , and would be highly obliged to work with this organisation through GSoC 2015 and  contribute .
[13:15:46] <arthurvr> sambuddhabasu1: Good to hear that! You read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List already?
[13:16:27] <saurabhmishra> sir , sorry
[13:16:39] <arthurvr> saurabhmishra: No need to sorry!
[13:17:21] <saurabhmishra> sir was that msg for me ?
[13:18:02] <arthurvr> Yes, :))
[13:18:13] <arthurvr> Pinged the wrong person :)
[13:18:47] <arschmitz> saurabhmishra: Hi not all of that issue can be worked on yet
[13:18:52] <arschmitz> but if you want to start looking at getting involved you can try to look at out current demos and improve one or more
[13:19:25] <arschmitz> saurabhmishra: also please read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[13:21:05] <saurabhmishra> sir , am little confused .
[13:21:33] <saurabhmishra> I have gone through the wiki page you mentioned
[13:41:43] <saurabhmishra> Can you please guide me further ?
[13:42:28] <arthurvr> As arschmitz said, you canâ€™t get started with all of that issue.
[13:43:24] <arthurvr> But of course you can get involved in other ways. You can try to look at out current demos and improve those, for example.
[13:46:57] <saurabhmishra> Does it mean I should look forward to other  topics ? 
[13:48:50] <saurabhmishra> I got it ,  I need to see other repos , and start working on them . 
[14:23:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jaspermdegroot closed issue #7974: float:right on footer not working 02http://git.io/AgbQ
[14:37:03] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: are you around?
[14:37:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah
[14:37:24] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: hey
[14:37:35] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I was looking into updating button CSS
[14:38:14] <jasperdegroot> if we just use display inline-block for icons, how we do that with fullwidth button?
[14:38:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened pull request #7988: Panel: Stretch external panel to document height (06master...067983-external-panel-vertical-stretch) 02http://git.io/psvf
[14:38:41] <jasperdegroot> the text has to be centered while the icon has to be at the beginning or the end
[14:43:03] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Still around?
[14:43:32] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes
[14:43:49] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: looks like in foundation they just center the icon with the text
[14:44:07] <arschmitz> and they are pretty much the only other framework that does full width buttons
[14:45:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, crap ... I'm going to ask you to do another round of review for the widget backcompat PR, because I need to extend the backcompat for the popup arrow, because the popup arrow applies ui-overlay-shadow to the arrow div, which is ui-popup-arrow.
[14:46:01] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: that would quite a big change
[14:46:28] <gabriel_schulhof> So, in that case, ui-overlay-shadow needs to be added to the right hand side of both ui-popup and ui-popup-arrow, and the backcompat is not configured to deal with a situation where classProp is actually two keys.
[14:46:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'm not going to ask you just yet though, because I seem to have misplaced the commits that address your review comments.
[14:46:56] <arschmitz> ok
[14:46:58] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't get it. I was sure I'd fixed everything.
[14:47:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i would probably handle the non standard stuff in the widget itself
[14:47:41] <arschmitz> rather then add to the backcompat directly
[14:48:16] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, that's what I'm planning, but in the backcompat there's currently a typo: _getInitalOptions: function()
[14:48:18] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: actually kendoui mobile does too and they do the same center the icon with the text
[14:48:33] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and I don't want to override that in the popup arrow backcompat.
[14:48:44] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I'm going to fix the PR post-haste.
[14:48:51] <arschmitz> ok
[14:48:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and then ask you to do another review.
[14:49:13] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: I am trying to find Foundation example of fullwidth button in their docs
[14:49:16] <arschmitz> sure just let me know
[14:49:38] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: they call it "expanded"
[14:49:49] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh! I'm such an idiot. It's about that hadMobile stuff ... I deleted it from one module but not both! *facepalm*
[14:50:23] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: basicly they dont do anythign special they just make the button full width and text-align:center
[14:50:29] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, just can't find example with icon
[14:50:37] <arschmitz> oh good luck
[14:50:53] <arschmitz> i had to google and look up on stackoverflow to find how to add icons to buttons in foundation lol
[14:50:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yes, that's simple
[14:51:24] <arschmitz> i dont know why there are not examples in there docs it seems like a basic thing
[14:51:35] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7975 - whenever you have time, please, thanks!
[14:51:50] <gabriel_schulhof> I really hope I nailed it this time.
[14:52:26] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: but how about things like our checkboxes where we align text left but also icon position right
[14:52:55] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: well thats a special case and a different widget its easy enough to have checkbox position it
[14:52:58] <jasperdegroot> having both icon and text left is simple, but aligning the text left and the icon right can't be done
[14:53:36] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah true, we can use specific CSS there
[14:54:26] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: you can also place the text in a div and do text-align center on that
[14:54:40] <arschmitz> and float it beside the icon
[14:55:07] <jasperdegroot> well if it's floated it won't be fullwidth anymore
[14:56:36] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: but I guess your point is that with bit markup and custom CSS you can get same style as 1.4 which is true
[14:57:19] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: ok, I will make both text and icon centered in buttons
[15:03:34] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: http://jsbin.com/bosohu/1/edit?html,css,output
[15:04:47] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: that JS Bin is using class "left" ... our icons don't have position classes anymore
[15:05:44] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: or did you mean it as example of how you can do it with custom markup and css?
[15:05:49] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: they still have a class so with with css thats simple
[15:05:57] <arschmitz> custom
[15:06:05] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[15:07:31] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: also with classes option you can add classes
[15:07:57] <arschmitz> so overall its very simple to document how to do that positioning we just wont do it by default
[15:08:55] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: yeah, I am not saying it's difficult to get same result as in 1.4. Just saying we can't give fullwidth buttons with icons same look as 1.4 out of the box
[15:11:51] <jasperdegroot> unless we keep same css and target the icon spans with span:first-child and span:last-child
[15:19:14] <jasperdegroot> with same CSS I mean we keep using position absolute and don't switch to inline-block
[15:19:30] <jasperdegroot> problem will be :last-child and IE8
