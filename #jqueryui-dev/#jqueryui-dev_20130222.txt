[05:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, I was sleeping for part of that time :-P
[05:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> The sad thing is this seems like it was trying to be addressed already.
[05:56:09] <petersendidit> Yea
[05:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> We were using border-bottom: 0 not border-bottom: none
[05:56:30] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that kills all the properties though.
[05:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9112 is awesome
[06:00:09] <petersendidit> thats great!
[06:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nice. This is a one line fix.
[06:03:19] <petersendidit> Can you add a test case for this?
[06:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what's gonna take the most time :-)
[06:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Damn, this test is gonna take a while to run.

[11:48:54] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: on it
[11:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Thanks.
[11:49:06] <mikesherov> I'm going to want that guy to write tests :-)
[11:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> The change seems small, and I trust this guy.
[11:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> But there were no unit tests.
[11:49:47] <mikesherov> Yeah, I trust him too. Tests aren't about proving he's right, it's about the next guy :-)
[11:49:53] <mikesherov> Namely, Dave_Stein
[11:50:12] <mikesherov> If he can't write tests, I'll convert his regression tests
[11:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: He already signed the CLA. He fixed a few other bugs.
[11:59:03] <mikesherov> OK, great
[11:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> It was his fix that caused the regressions :-P
[11:59:08] <mikesherov> OH, LOL
[11:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why I pinged him about fixing these.
[11:59:49] <mikesherov> Oh
[11:59:53] <mikesherov> Well then
[12:00:07] <mikesherov> so, catch me up if you don't mind
[12:00:15] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein and the interactions stuff
[12:00:35] <mikesherov> I see ngsilverman is contributing PR's to that now too?
[12:00:42] <mikesherov> who is that?
[12:00:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> ngsilverman fixed some bugs in sortable, then asked about the rewrites.
[12:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> So he's now working on the sortable rewrite.
[12:01:34] <mikesherov> oh, awesome
[12:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> He joined the API redesign call earlier this week.
[12:01:45] <mikesherov> and where is Dave_Stein at?
[12:02:14] <scott_gonzalez> He did some updates for droppable and is now supposed to be looking into writing more tests.
[12:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> I also asked him to look into what it would take to make the base interaction layer support multi-touch.
[12:03:23] <mikesherov> so he's done with draggable and draggable's tests, and is now onto droppable?
[12:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> He kept saying "I'm waiting on mikesherov to write tests" so I reminded him that it's important for him to be writing tests too ;-)
[12:03:37] <mikesherov> and ngsilverman is attacking sortable
[12:03:41] <mikesherov> all of which needs test
[12:03:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think there are still tests that need to be written for draggable.
[12:03:45] <mikesherov> OK
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> I still haven't gotten a chance to review.
[12:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not until after the conf.
[12:04:01] <mikesherov> yup
[12:04:29] <mikesherov> yeah, we also started a master_tests branch
[12:05:02] <mikesherov> that was going to fill out the missing interactions tests for current master
[12:05:20] <mikesherov> and Dave_Stein was crying because we found several bugs with current master just by writing the tests
[12:05:27] <mikesherov> I can't wait to the conference
[12:05:34] <mikesherov> I need 3 days to just focus on this
[12:05:44] <mikesherov> and the effects rewrite too
[12:05:48] <mikesherov> SO MANY THINGS
[12:06:56] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: should we move forward with the grunt 0.4 effort too now that it's released?
[12:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get that in for 1.10.2
[12:08:44] <mikesherov> K, do you have any other specific goals for 1.10.2 that you want me to focus on?
[12:08:54] <kborchers> mikesherov: and there is this ;) http://www.screenr.com/LSc7

[12:10:19] <mikesherov> although, there's some good momentum now for a variant of elem.getStyle()
[12:10:44] <mikesherov> I have FF support, and hopefully mkwst can get us a webkit implementor to light a fire under the CSSWG's ass
[12:13:56] <mikesherov> ugh, iframes
