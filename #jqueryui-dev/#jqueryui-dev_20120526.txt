[06:43:32] <rxaviers> kborchers, jzaefferer, hey guys, I have a PR of Popup for your consideration  :) , any doubts plz just let me know
[19:10:48] <atrigent> hey guys, is there a way this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/544 pull request could get some attention?
[19:10:49] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by atrigent (5m, 3w ago): A small iframeFix refinement
[19:13:31] <Krinkle-away> atrigent: As you suggest in the pr comment. The proces is usually bug report > confirmation/test (if needed) -> pull request > review > merge
[19:13:49] <atrigent> alright, thanks
[19:14:16] <Krinkle-away> but the PR queue is also looked at a lot, so this should work too (if it is a simple fix)
[19:14:42] <Krinkle-away> but there is 44 PRs at the moment, so if you need priority, then a bug report would help
[19:22:55] <atrigent> Krinkle-away: well I submitted that pull request 5 months ago so it's probably not going to get looked at unless I do something
[19:23:18] <Krinkle-away> Hm.. that doesn't sound good.
[19:23:32] <Krinkle-away> Honestly though, I only idle here for unit testing. I'm not very much into jQuery UI.
[19:23:44] <Krinkle-away> I wouldn't know.. sorry :/
[19:23:47] <atrigent> haha alright
[19:23:59] <Krinkle-away> I thought it was for jquery core
