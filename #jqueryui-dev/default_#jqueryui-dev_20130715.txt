[05:12:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around
[05:13:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:13:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey
[05:14:08] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[05:14:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you happen to notice we have 100% build failure since you merged grunticon stuff?
[05:14:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[05:15:06] <arschmitz> any idea why?
[05:15:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not yet, but I am looking into it right now
[05:15:27] <arschmitz> ok
[05:15:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i had that fixed in a different test i was writing and then didn't for that one â€¦ that whole file is a mess. most of that test is copied from one above :/
[05:15:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: first it was because I forgot to update a test
[05:16:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: after that it's the same nav sequence test every time
[05:16:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it passes local though
[05:16:20] <arschmitz> i looked at it last night but didnt see anything obvious
[05:16:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'll go through and clean up all of the menu test formatting tonight, not just that one
[05:16:51] <arschmitz> its a file not found error but the file is there and infact 3 tests on that same file pass before the failure
[05:16:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the grunticon merge didn't go smooth
[05:17:11] <uGoMobi> but I think I solved that
[05:17:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: jhogervorst mentioned same error for his PR
[05:17:57] <uGoMobi> his branch shouldn't be affected by the grunticon merge
[05:18:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm sequence-dialog-hash-key-tests.html was the culprit last night..... this morning its sequence-push-state-disabled-dialog-hash-key-tests.html
[05:19:11] <arschmitz> its not a test failure its a file not found error though is the thing
[05:19:32] <uGoMobi> yeah.. not able to load
[05:19:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe the paths are all wrong ... base tag?
[05:19:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, if the file is not found, yet there it is ...
[05:20:09] <_|Nix|_> AzaToth: Just off the top of my head ...
[05:20:22] <_|Nix|_> AzaToth: Sorry - I meant arschmitz 
[05:20:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: execpt that the uri of the file not found and the uri of the file running the test are the same lol
[05:20:44] <_|Nix|_> *floor = jaw;
[05:20:53] <arschmitz> yeah its really weird
[05:21:50] <arschmitz> i need to look at that support test i think
[05:22:00] <arschmitz> i wonder if its causing some sort of weirdness
[05:23:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, in the spirit of git bisect, is there a specific commit that precipitated this weirdness?
[05:23:21] <AzaToth> _|Nix|_: no probs
[05:23:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe I found something
[05:24:00] <uGoMobi> looks like it's a linting issue
[05:24:53] <arschmitz> hmmm odd that would cause that but iv seen weirder things lol
[05:27:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the linter actually catches some simple bugs too, like undefined variables, etc. I've had code that would access event.* without a var event = whatever; and it would work, because window.event happens to be within scope. Of course, the consequences were unintended, but really hard to notice.
[05:27:59] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[05:28:27] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[05:29:35] <frequent> I'm still sitting over the filter demos. Will finish tonight my time. 
[05:29:52] <frequent> still ok?
[05:30:04] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah, more than ok
[05:30:13] <frequent> ok. cool. 
[05:30:39] <frequent> then I'm back out.... 
[05:30:49] <uGoMobi> frequent: I don't think we will be update everything in the demos before alpha release
[05:30:54] <frequent> (meeting)
[05:30:58] <frequent> ok. good
[05:31:11] <frequent> talk tonight
[05:31:15] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok later
[05:33:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can  you run grunt test and look at the error?
[05:33:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. On master, right?
[05:33:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, master
[05:35:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, jussec ...
[05:37:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Tests are running ...
[05:37:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, then I probably need to update something
[05:37:49] <uGoMobi> I got error right away
[05:37:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, you mean there's some linting error on your side?
[05:38:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm at 9f70f064fc26bfbe3c7feded5a737064bb961a38 (Core CSS: Overflow-x hidden for page because navbars are wider than the page. Fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5566.)
[05:38:22] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5566 by cricto (5mon 1w ago): Navbar width issue when in header or footer and has >= 3 buttons
[05:38:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's last commit
[05:38:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So far, so green.
[05:38:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I get a linting error right away
[05:39:11] <uGoMobi> running npm update
[05:40:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh yeah, I didn't do that ... 
[05:40:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll interrupt the tests and run with the latest and greatest.
[05:41:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's complaining about unescaped chars in js/navigation/path.js
[05:42:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh no - not that!
[05:42:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's the id-to-selector regex ...
[05:43:05] <uGoMobi> right
[05:43:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Didn't we switch to the git version of jshint for that?
[05:43:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's perfectly valid, but the linter can't cope with it.
[05:44:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm I see
[05:44:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if so, it's probably not the cause of our failing tests
[05:44:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if it gets past the linting then it's not the cause.
[05:45:13] <uGoMobi> exactly
[05:45:36] <_|Nix|_> Well, it got past the linting.
[05:45:43] <_|Nix|_> It's running test now ...
[05:45:54] <_|Nix|_> I'll let it run, what with the new npm lineup 'n all.
[05:46:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks
[05:54:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... two popup tests are failing ...
[05:54:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but navigation passes?
[05:55:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not there yet.
[05:55:11] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:55:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's doing nav now.
[06:01:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird ... the popup tests pass in Chrome.
[06:01:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you get the same errors as here https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/9093055 ?
[06:01:56] <uGoMobi> (for popup)
[06:02:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[06:03:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, that might be something about the new core or the new phantomjs or something.
[06:04:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, those two assertions consistently fail.
[06:04:46] <_|Nix|_> I'll fix it.
[06:05:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah probably an issue with offset()
[06:17:50] <_|Nix|_> K, that's totally weird. The popup is at (124,-9749) :/
[07:43:36] <_|Nix|_> Wow! http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/

[08:08:58] <gseguin> agcolom: are you speaking?
[08:09:06] <agcolom> I'm hoping so ;-)
[08:09:27] <agcolom> Submitted an abstract.... Journey to the center of jQuery!
[08:09:56] <agcolom> (in ref to Journey to the Center of the Earth)
[10:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> "Tabs at bottom: The concept of this implementation, where the dynamic content appears before the triggering elements in the DOM element flow, causes a reading order accessibility issue for screen reader users, who will not know that the content that is being rendered is being inserted before the elements that currently have focus. As a general practice, dynamic content should not be inserted before the triggering 
[10:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to deleting the tabs at bottom demo from jQuery UI?
[10:06:35] <arschmitz> hmm unrelated to tabs this make me think of a general issue with mobile ui design
[10:06:47] <arschmitz> that a bottom nav bar is SUPER common
[10:07:06] <arschmitz> that changes page content that immediately proceeds it 
[10:07:30] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[10:07:31] <arschmitz> precedes 
[10:26:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when we work on navbar widget review we could look into supporting position fixed
[10:27:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so you can have it before the content in your markup but position it at the bottom
[10:27:10] <uGoMobi> without using footer
[11:48:31] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15frequent synchronize pull request #6145: filter widget - first commit (06master...06filter_widget)  02http://git.io/Pm0lNQ
[12:07:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: very interesting idea
[12:07:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually theres no need to do anything a footer can go before content in source order
[12:07:59] <arschmitz> if its fixed
[12:08:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, but semantically that doesn't seem correct
[12:08:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah it seems weird but we dont use a footer element
[12:08:35] <arschmitz> we use a div so really there is nothing wrong with it
[12:08:39] <uGoMobi> we do add ARIA role though
[12:08:58] <uGoMobi> role=contentinfo"
[12:08:59] <arschmitz> true but we could just make that configurable
[12:09:09] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[12:09:19] <uGoMobi> that's something we wanted to do anyway
[12:09:38] <uGoMobi> okay, we can show this in a demo then
[12:09:50] <arschmitz> but basicly the solution is just encourage people to place footers containing a navbar before content
[12:10:08] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:10:24] <uGoMobi> you might want to use nav element
[12:10:35] <arschmitz> hmm there is another question here though that someone who knows more about aria would need to answer
[12:10:43] <uGoMobi> well, that could go on the ul of the navbar
[12:11:02] <arschmitz> this is a matter of persepective in mobile
[12:11:37] <arschmitz> because are you looking at pages like the panes of tabs because the content swaps out but its truly always the same document 
[12:11:41] <arschmitz> (ajax)
[12:12:03] <arschmitz> or ... because of our page model to you look at it as navigation 
[12:12:11] <uGoMobi> right
[12:12:38] <arschmitz> meaning it does not change preceding content but navigates
[12:17:05] <uGoMobi> i think I would still look at it as navigation
[12:19:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I found the problem with popup. For some reason, setting .attr( "tabindex", "0" ) on the container causes the offset to be reset O_o
[12:19:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ahh
[12:20:25] <uGoMobi> nice find
[12:20:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Really st00pid! What does tabindex have to do with offset?
[12:21:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's probably a bug in phantomjs ...
[12:21:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not one I'd care to report, because I have to write a test case for it, and ain't nobody got time fo' that!
[12:21:44] <uGoMobi> well it affects what element get focus
[12:21:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but that shouldn't cause the element to be moved!
[12:22:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what was the test again? position of the popup itself?
[12:22:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Popup opens and closes"
[12:23:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The test checks many things, including that the placement constraints are observed.
[12:24:18] <uGoMobi> I see, yeah it's weird that focus causes a reposition
[12:24:39] <_|Nix|_> I suspect that, for some reason, it causes the style attribute to be erased.
[12:25:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 
[12:25:01] <_|Nix|_> 		offset = this._ui.container.offset();
[12:25:01] <_|Nix|_> 		this._ui.container.attr( "tabindex", "0" ).focus();
[12:25:01] <_|Nix|_> 		this._ui.container.offset( offset );
[12:25:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^ fixes it :/
[12:25:22] <_|Nix|_> This is terribe!
[12:25:28] <_|Nix|_> s/be/ble/
[12:25:58] <_|Nix|_> It's, like, WTF?!
[12:26:36] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:28:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wish I could show this to the phantomjs developers.
[12:28:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's phantomjs-1.9.1, BTW.
[12:29:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can't think of anything that explains it
[12:29:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! I have no idea how to go about this ... all I can do is cut out that test ..
[12:30:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:it returned an offset like 200-something, 9000-something right?
[12:30:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: -99xx
[12:31:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, the value of ui-popup-hidden + the width of the popup, I think.
[12:31:10] <uGoMobi> ah yeah, minus
[12:31:38] <arschmitz> hmmm im still wanting to know why we are getting the file not found error
[12:31:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Ping!
[12:33:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Interestingly, it does not get rid of the style.
[12:33:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess the computed value changes for some reason ...
[12:35:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can yank that test and make a separate unit test that ensures that constraints and position are calculated sanely.
[12:35:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you added or change this test when reviewing popup?
[12:36:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That test has been there for a long time.
[12:36:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: During the popup review, I basically parameterized it so I can perform the test on many different popups.
[12:37:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can check out the pre-popup-review code and check if the test passes.
[12:38:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: RE: highcontrast mode there is an actual standard for checking this 
[12:38:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/ check out #12
[12:42:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so it actually passes with old tests. I'm doing a bisect to find the culprit.
[12:42:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks, will check that out
[12:43:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, curious what caused it
[12:43:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did it fail with all core versions we test against?
[12:43:53] <uGoMobi> haven't checked that
[12:44:17] <uGoMobi> anyways, have to run an errand... brb
[12:55:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "Core CSS: Overflow-x hidden for page because navbars are wider than the page. Fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5566." (9f70f064fc26bfbe3c7feded5a737064bb961a38)
[12:55:52] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5566 by cricto (5mon 1w ago): Navbar width issue when in header or footer and has >= 3 buttons
[12:56:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what breaks it.
[12:56:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... on phantomjs. It works on Chrome ...
[13:03:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: speaking of popup
[13:03:12] <arschmitz> i have somone complaining of slow to open popups
[13:03:31] <arschmitz> but that using $("#popup").popup("open");
[13:03:38] <arschmitz> makes it much faster
[13:07:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Really? Interesting. Well, kinda makes sense ... if you use a link it has to go through pagebeforechange.
[13:07:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It ends up calling open, of course, but it does so after the whole click handler and the beginning of changePage.
[13:08:02] <arschmitz> yeah skips the whole nav stack and linkbinding
[13:08:22] <arschmitz> wouldnt think that it would make a huge noticable difference though
[13:08:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: data-rel="popup" was always a convenience.
[13:08:35] <arschmitz> of course
[13:08:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you know you have to open a popup, the best way is to ... open a popup.
[13:09:02] <arschmitz> something to keep in mind as a optimization to suggest to people though
[13:09:13] <arschmitz> (i proposed a talk for austin about optimizing JQM)
[13:09:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool! I wish I could go ...
[13:09:41] <arschmitz> intel wont let you or family?
[13:09:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Family ...
[13:10:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But I'm almost certainly gonna try for Amsterdam, if it materializes.
[13:10:23] <arschmitz> yeah its pretty soon after portland plus you submitted for html5 conf right?
[13:10:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[13:11:05] <arschmitz> cool ill be in austin for sure not sure if im talking yet though
[13:11:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[13:11:54] <arschmitz> the amsterdam one im a little unclear about if thats like europeans only or what lol
[13:12:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nah! That'd be a st00pid limitation.
[13:12:24] <arschmitz> lol
[13:12:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I added that overflow-x this morning. I thought I saw the popup test failing last night already but I am not sure
[13:12:46] <arschmitz> id like to make it if it happens as well but got to wait and see 
[13:13:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's more convenient for us over on this side, but for Oleg it's probably almost, if not just as far as it would be for you.
[13:14:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'd be curious if it failed on any real browser.
[13:14:10] * _|Nix|_ is grabbing his test devices ...
[13:14:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I tested on a few before submitting
[13:14:36] <uGoMobi> because I know overflow is tricky stuff
[13:14:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: popup passed last night
[13:14:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[13:15:19] <arschmitz> last night it was linting then the file not found issue
[13:15:50] <uGoMobi> yeah, I was responsible for the first failures
[13:16:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The question is, is there any other browser where the offset is affected by the tabindex?
[13:16:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i might comment out the svg support test on my next commit to see if it fixes the file not found issue then put it back on next commit
[13:17:09] <arschmitz> it seems like its somehow causing the issue
[13:17:15] <arschmitz> but not local
[13:17:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: okay, but that would be really weird
[13:17:44] <uGoMobi> let's try it
[13:17:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah but the thing is the file DOES exist
[13:17:57] <uGoMobi> I know
[13:18:02] <arschmitz> and its not always the same file even
[13:18:57] <arschmitz> i hate test issues i cant reproduce locally
[13:19:07] <arschmitz> oh and i have a theory about our random failures
[13:19:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, iOS 6.0.1 seems OK ...
[13:19:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Please, do tell!
[13:19:39] <arschmitz> they are always on async nav tests
[13:19:45] <arschmitz> and started when we moved to travis
[13:20:00] <arschmitz> and never happen local
[13:20:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, IINM they were happening on jenkins as well ...
[13:20:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on Android I ested custom select only
[13:20:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will test popup on 4.2 now
[13:20:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How nice then that I just fired up the 2.3.5 ...
[13:20:31] <uGoMobi> s/ested/tested
[13:20:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hm ok hard to go no server moved but could still be same cause anyway
[13:20:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, for sure.
[13:20:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think its a plain old race condition 
[13:21:11] <arschmitz> i think on our nice fast not overloaded machines its fine
[13:21:24] <arschmitz> but get on to travis where it is shared and who knows how slim resources are
[13:21:29] <arschmitz> and nav just takes longer
[13:21:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think so too ... if the load gets high, the failsafe timeout strikes.
[13:22:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know, it'd be interesting to see if setting a ridiculously long failsafe timeout will produce failures.
[13:22:22] <arschmitz> and we cant just disable them as has been suggested before becuase iv seen it happen on at least a dozen separate tests 
[13:22:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was thinking about upping it
[13:22:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and actually, on my machine, if I let the tests run and start surfing or whatever, I do sometimes see failures.
[13:23:05] <arschmitz> really? hmm didnt know anyone had reporduced local
[13:23:12] <arschmitz> but that actually supports my theory anyway
[13:23:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that's because I'm also running BOINC so my memory usage is high and swap sometimes kicks in, etc.
[13:23:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "Reproduced" :)
[13:23:49] <arschmitz> yeah was not paying attenion and reading something else while typing lol
[13:23:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think so - and there's no fsck-ing way I'm sitting through a test run doing nothing else :)
[13:24:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah dont blame you lol
[13:24:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I get failures in nav tests too if I open other tabs on Chrome
[13:24:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when running in chrome or phantom?
[13:24:58] <uGoMobi> chrome
[13:25:06] <arschmitz> ok
[13:25:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: phantom here.
[13:25:11] <arschmitz> i never run tests in chrome lol
[13:25:13] <uGoMobi> so I shouldn't touch the browser when running tests
[13:25:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I do grunt test then switch over to FF.
[13:25:34] <arschmitz> yeah but anyway this all supports my theory 
[13:25:44] <arschmitz> that we just need to up the timeouts
[13:26:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see a popup issue on Android 4.2 native and chrome
[13:26:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[13:26:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: problem with that popup test though is regardless of if its a real problem we need to get it to pass in phantom or we will just always fail
[13:26:42] <uGoMobi> annoying that it affects offset() though
[13:26:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Problem is, if we do, tests will take forever, because there are places where a signal is intentionally waited for and the test is that the signal must not arrive - i.e., the failsafe timeout must fire.
[13:26:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, weird.
[13:27:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[13:27:14] <arschmitz> but its that or random failure which is better?
[13:27:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "that".
[13:27:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: IMO.
[13:27:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: As for the popup offset, I think I can yank that test and replace it with a unit test.
[13:27:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i agree tests take so long already whats another few minutes lol
[13:28:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After all, I just have to check the correctness of the calculations.
[13:28:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was just saying we need to find a fix that works in phantom
[13:28:35] <arschmitz> whether through modifying tests or whatever
[13:28:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I'd hate to modify DOM manip just to please phantom. No way!
[13:29:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What is the market share of phantom? :)
[13:29:07] <arschmitz> for sure
[13:29:22] <arschmitz> really high among screen shot generators :)
[13:29:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, really?
[13:29:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know, I was always wondering: How do you tell phantom what size screen it should have?
[13:29:50] <arschmitz> yeah for sure its the easiest way to automate website screen shots
[13:29:56] <arschmitz> its a config
[13:30:08] <arschmitz> its also popular for task automation
[13:30:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I figured, but what is screen rez set to for our tests?
[13:30:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think we set it anywhere ...
[13:30:52] <arschmitz> yeah not sure the default
[13:31:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv actually used phantom a lot for both of those uses
[13:31:33] <arschmitz> you can do awesome stuff with it
[13:32:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, do you think it might be worth fixing in phantom then? After all, if you open a popup in phantom, it won't show up :/
[13:32:30] <arschmitz> hmmmmm probably not
[13:32:37] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec ...
[13:32:46] <arschmitz> most screenshots are going to be like front page no interaction type stuff
[13:32:55] <arschmitz> and for task automation it does not matter
[13:33:19] <_|Nix|_> We have a workaround for some Android bugs in popup. It adds ui-popup-open to the page.
[13:33:44] <_|Nix|_> ... in response to a browser sniff ...
[13:33:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thumbnail generator for websites
[13:34:21] <arschmitz> http://uglymongrel.com/#thumbnail
[13:34:52] <arschmitz> hmmm nevermind guess i need to update that
[13:35:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L658
[13:35:23] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:36:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Would it help if we added a class of "ui-popup-active" to the page as done for the workaround at that link?
[13:37:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is, would it help with avoiding that weird popup offset issue?
[13:37:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was a super old demo i did for someone guess i should not have used latest and didnt even know ichanged to jquery 1.9 ugh lol i should look at my own website more often
[13:38:09] <arschmitz> oh damn it does work still its just going crazy slow with the generation
[13:38:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you could try it, really know idea if it would fix phantomjs as well
[13:40:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can't really harm if I remember that fix well
[13:41:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If I add that class, can you associate some CSS with it to also work around this issue?
[13:42:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess that's what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking that the previous workaround would also fix this.
[13:42:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: You mean override for overflow-x hidden?
[13:43:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. Dunno if there's anything that can be done in CSS.
[13:43:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If there is, then that class would definitely be the handle by which to do it.
[13:47:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we should only add the override for those 2 tests
[13:48:14] <uGoMobi> so before running the test add some class to the page and afterwards remove it
[13:48:20] <uGoMobi> could be any class, right?
[13:49:30] <uGoMobi> .ui-page.ui-page-overflow-override { overflow: visible; }
[13:50:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nah. I'd rather not do that. I'll get rid of the test and implement a unit test to check the correctness of the coordinate calculator.
[13:50:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's better to have unit tested code anyway.
[13:51:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok

[14:00:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Will we support core 1.7.2 in 1.4.0?
[14:01:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no
[14:01:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 1.8-1.10 + 2.0
[14:01:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Excellent! Then I can get rid of the document.height workaround ...
[14:01:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, right
[14:04:14] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay progress!
[14:04:21] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:04:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: IE7 will become C-grade
[14:04:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so if you run into any workaround for that... you can remove it
[14:05:21] <uGoMobi> IE8 will still be A-grade though
[14:05:47] <uGoMobi> unless you use core 2.0 but that's a different story
[14:12:32] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#490 (master - 2a14641 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[14:14:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : 1.8 and 1.10 are failing on a different test than 2.0 and git
[14:15:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Repeatedly?
[14:15:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: checking that now but history loads slow
[14:17:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, so I think 1.8 and 1.10 had the random failure that we noticed before
[14:30:21] <uGoMobi> I got rid of the linting errors and can reproduce the test failure on phantomjs locally now
[14:35:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^ I am running the tests again without the inlineSVG support test code

[21:23:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok found the issue
[21:24:35] <arschmitz> its an issue with phantom it does not support the data uri api 
[21:27:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: apparently from what i can find anything with a data uri will not render and will break qunit
[21:27:43] <arschmitz> other people have reported same same issue
[21:29:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: commenting out the img.src line fixes everything
[21:31:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im thinking we need to disable this in the phantom tests
[21:44:39] <JamesMGreene> Heeeeey smart JS people
[21:44:48] <JamesMGreene> Is there any Object property that CANNOT be overridden/hidden by adding an "own" property by the same name?

[21:50:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: $.support.inlineSVG = $.noop; 
[21:51:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have a fix for the test working
