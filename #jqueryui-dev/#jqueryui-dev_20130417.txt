[04:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: nice alias :-)
[04:54:23] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! I need your brain!
[04:54:32] <scott_gonzalez> So do I!
[04:54:36] <agcolom>  ;-)
[04:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> What's up?
[04:54:53] <agcolom> I think this is a quick one...
[04:56:09] <agcolom> I have started updating one of the event to use the new template. but I have a mismatch in the versions
[04:56:10] <agcolom> >> Error: Mismatching versions. grunt-wordpress: 1.0.7; XML-RPC version: 1.0.5
[04:56:38] <agcolom> so I guess there's something else I need to update but I'm not sure what
[04:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> You need to update jquery-wp-content
[04:57:41] <agcolom> I tried to do that but I think I may have done it wrong... 
[04:58:23] <agcolom> do I go into the folder and do git pull?
[04:58:36] <agcolom> (the jquery-wp-content folder)
[05:00:32] <agcolom> all fixed!
[05:01:14] <agcolom> I think I did update in the jquery folder instead of jquery-wp-content before!
[05:01:17] <agcolom> Thank you!
[06:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I definitely don't want to get into this conversation: https://twitter.com/mindrudan/status/324514807581650944
[06:29:49] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @mindrudan: @scott_gonzalez you are right, maybe comparison is not the word, it's more of an analogy. #javascript cannot really be compared with #php
[06:31:55] <tj_vantoll> It's like a really bad SAT question.
[06:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:39:40] <tj_vantoll> 1) jQuery is to jQuery UI as PHP is to...
[06:39:40] <tj_vantoll> A) Zend
[06:39:40] <tj_vantoll> B) Zepto
[06:39:40] <tj_vantoll> C) Ruby

[08:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> The modified date should be updated, but the creation date shouldn't change.
[08:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> And new plugins should be based on creation date.
[08:44:17] <gnarf> it is
[08:44:18] <scott_gonzalez> I just haven't had a chance to dig into it yet.
[08:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:44:32] <gnarf> the sql query is correct

[09:57:49] <rxaviers> hehe
[09:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> We should try to have a call with jzaefferer again.
[09:57:58] <rxaviers> ok
[09:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> Probably easier to actually talk through it.
[09:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's just some confusion here.
[09:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like we're mostly on the same page.
[09:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> We have stuff in jquery-ui that we don't care about.
[09:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> And the fact that it's there is probably making you think it's important for us to have it there.
[09:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> Or at least have it accessible from there.
[09:59:25] <rxaviers> ok
[09:59:29] <rxaviers> anytime, just let me know what time works best
[09:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Let us know when you're around.
[09:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> Even if that isn't till tomorrow morning.
[10:02:45] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: heres
[10:04:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I'm starting to change the event entries. Quick question: I am not sure what the signature should be for the swipe event (no rush... whenever you have time) thanks!
[10:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Ping me in an hour (on a call).
[10:04:48] <agcolom> ok, thanks. Will do.
[10:05:19] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I think this has been fixed for a while: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7406 if you agree, close.
[10:12:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I just read your reply... We definitely are on the same page. Great. To accomplish that is why Im proposing a slight different approach, instead of moving stuff to DB, it makes sense to actually move things to jquery-ui. We'll talk about it and let's see if you also think it makes sense.
[10:15:59] <rxaviers> jzaefferer,  just let us know when you have some time to talk about duplicate cutoff (ui vs db) with me and scott_gonzalez

[12:12:25] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It doesn't look like it has any extra properties.
[12:12:37] <agcolom> no I don't think it has.
[12:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://api.jquerymobile.com/swipe/
[12:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> Should we have public APIs that are buried under $.event.special?
[12:13:37] <DaveMethvin> no
[12:13:45] <DaveMethvin> that's a hook point
[12:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so those four properties should be exposed somewhere else.
[12:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that people should even be customizing them.
[12:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: So if there are no custom properties, then the <signature> would be empty.
[12:16:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, great. Thanks.
[12:16:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: question number 2: do you know where the entry is for http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ ?
[12:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, it seems really bad to be using the Touch Event API in the docs.
[12:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> categories.xml
[12:17:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/categories.xml#L89
[12:18:37] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: what do you think we should do about the touch events? (remove from the docs)
[12:18:39] <agcolom> ?
[12:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> The event should become useful.
[12:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> There's no reason that pageX, pageY, etc. shouldn't be on the swipe event.
[12:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> If you have to dig into original event, then there's something very wrong.
[12:26:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Are you saying there's something wrong with the way the jQuery Mobile swipe event is implemented? (just trying to be 100% sure of what the issue is)?
[12:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: If you need to go down to the original event to get pageX, then yes.
[12:26:46] <agcolom> ok, should I ask the dev people to have a look?
[12:27:18] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Oh, I see...
[12:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> This may just be the docs.
[12:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> Like 90% of this page should go away.
[12:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> We shouldn't document implementations.
[12:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> And users shouldn't be changing how the swipe event works.
[12:27:58] <agcolom> I just ported what we had. 
[12:28:07] <agcolom> Ok, I get it (I think ;-) )
[12:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> At first, I didn't realize that the code blocks were "this is how the event is implemented"
[12:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> We definitely shouldn't be encouraging users to change how the event works.
[12:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> Or what data is returned from the helpers.
[12:28:55] <agcolom> so we shouldn't say The swipe event can also be extend to add your own logic or functionality. The following methods can be extended:
[12:30:12] <scott_gonzalez> right
[12:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> The swipe event should just be the swipe event.
[12:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> And it should use value that work everywhere.
[12:30:52] <agcolom> looks like it may not have been me who added that bit, as I can't find it in the original docs 
[12:30:59] <agcolom> let me check.

[12:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> If it's indented, it wasn't cherry-picked.
[12:36:11] <agcolom> Seriously I don't remember at all why I did that!!!??? or even where that came from!!!
[12:36:42] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: I am speechless ;-)
[12:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> 15 tickets for 1.10.3 :-) http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/21?V=1.10.3
[12:37:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so should all the additions in  https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/0d7cb5e55253f281e61ac441258761cac9e0b147 be removed?
[12:37:17] <b-ot> agcolom: Anne-Gaelle Colom (3mon 15h ago): added swipe extension
[12:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: yeah
[12:38:13] <agcolom> ok, that's easy enough ;-) But now I want to know why on Earth I did this! 
[12:40:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I did this because it was added in the docs for 1.3 rc1 http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/api/events.html
[12:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's a really bad idea to expose that.
[12:43:03] <agcolom> here it is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b671eafe918e70df7bdd0f02564bd080a5f766f9#docs/api/events.html
[12:43:03] <b-ot> agcolom: Alexander Schmitz (3mon 1d ago): Docs: update swipe event documentation to include extensibility and warning about iOS.
[12:43:41] <agcolom> I'll check with the devs to find out why that was documented.
[12:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, it's also a bad idea to create special events with simple names if they're not from a standard.
[12:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> If a native swipe event gets standardized, Mobile will have a problem.
[12:47:15] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, so the touch events should be renamed?
[12:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be a good idea.
[12:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Something like gesture:swipe or mobile:swipe
[12:47:51] <agcolom> Is there already a naming standard for this?
[12:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> Widget events are all going to change to use a colon in the name.
[12:48:06] <agcolom> ok, great. 
[12:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile is the only jQuery project that has custom standalone events.
[12:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> Core has special event implementations, but they're all standard events.
[12:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> UI has lots of events, but they're all from widgets.
[12:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> And the naming convention will becomes <widget-name>:<event-name>
[12:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> The colon is the important part.
[12:49:05] <agcolom> ok. yes, that makes sense
[12:49:51] <agcolom> so I suppose we need to add that to the roadmap
[12:50:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: now I have a super easy question for you... on http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[12:51:09] <agcolom> I would like to align the first comment properly (like the others)
[12:51:32] <agcolom> Should I do that using a PR or can I just do it in the github editor?
[12:51:52] <agcolom> (or should I check with kswedberg ?
[12:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> Generally you should do it locally so you can test.
[12:53:01] <agcolom> ok, and while you're here, a question arose yesterday... will we have banches of the api docs per version?
[12:53:57] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That's up to you.
[12:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> I would highly recommend it.
[12:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> Core doesn't, and I think it's a bit strange.
[12:54:20] <agcolom> ok... how about UI?
[12:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> UI has a branch for each major version.
[12:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> Which allows us to have http://api.jqueryui.com/1.9/ and http://api.jqueryui.com/1.8/
[12:54:50] <agcolom> ok. So I think I'll follow what you do. 
[12:55:01] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: still around?
[12:55:08] <rxaviers> yesp
[12:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's fairly simple.
[12:55:10] <agcolom> (I'll probably have to borrow your brain again for that '-) )
[12:55:11] <rxaviers> yeap*
[12:55:28] <jzaefferer> still wanna talk about deduplication?
[12:55:38] <rxaviers> sure, gimme a sec
[12:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just creat a branch named x-y which represents versions x.y.*
[12:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> Once you have a branch, gnarf and I can get everything setup for deployment.
[12:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Do you plan on creating a 1-2 branch or just starting with 1-3 when 1.4.0 comes out?
[12:57:11] <agcolom> 1.2 is covered by the old docs so I would sonly start with 1-3 when 1.4.0 comes out
[12:57:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so just let me know when you're ready to start on 1.4 docs.
[12:57:40] <agcolom> Ok, I will. 
[12:58:00] <agcolom> Thanks again ;-) 
[12:58:11] <rxaviers> ok im all set
[12:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: regarding the theme files, it's a bit strange.
[12:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember why I cared about this.
[12:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> And I didn't explain it in the ticket.
[12:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> And the base theme is no longer on CDNs.
[12:59:38] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, is scott_gonzalez joining?
[13:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can just get rid of jquery.ui.base.css and the problem will naturally go away :-)
[13:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: jzaefferer: I can join now.
[14:24:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/37 I agree! (I was wondering whether it was intentional)
