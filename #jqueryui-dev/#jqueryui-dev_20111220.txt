[11:27:11] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: maybe i'm missing something but it looks like the changes work just fine for the autocomplete sync change event
[11:27:34] <kborchers> i pulled those changes into my local repo and created a test based on that jsbin and it seems to work
[11:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> you merged it with master and it worked?
[11:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...maybe menu changed again
[11:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test it later and see if I can find any problems
[11:28:29] <kborchers> ok, let me know. glad to look into that piece more if you need me ot
