[23:39:00] <yogesh_> Hi
[23:39:03] <yogesh_> there
[23:39:16] <yogesh_> When accessing my website on an iPad, the dialogs function fine in both orientations. But if the dialog is open and I rotate the iPad in landscape mode, the dialogs lose their positions.
[23:39:23] <yogesh_> I am using jquery dialog
[23:40:04] <yogesh_> I tried with setting the position of dialog using media query like this eg. @media screen and (max-width : 736px) and (orientation:landscape) { .ui-dialog { top: -852px !important; margin: 0 auto !important; } } but it has problem,  can any one suggest me the better solution
[23:40:23] <yogesh_> can anyone help me out
[23:40:59] <yogesh_> Hi
[23:42:10] <yogesh_> this problem is when we switch iPhone portrait mode to landscape
