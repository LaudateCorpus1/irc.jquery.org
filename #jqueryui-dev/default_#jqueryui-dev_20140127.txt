[02:08:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! Hey! We should be wrapping up 1.4.1 Real Soon Nowâ„¢, eh?
[02:08:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey
[02:09:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we can do a release end of this week or beginning next week
[02:10:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If so, we should really concentrate on autogrow. Both arschmitz and I have a pile of outstanding PRs on it. We really need to merge those carefully, and we have to do a ton of device testing ...
[02:11:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, would be nice if that pile of PR's land in one branch so we can test that branch before merging in master
[02:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... not a bad idea.
[02:12:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, arschmitz's PR touches autogrow, but also touches a pile of other things because it fixes animationComplete.
[02:12:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, that probably isn't well-placed on a branch.
[02:12:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then we just use the branch for testing
[02:12:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I have two different fixes for the jump-to-top issue. One is to add a div, and the other is to save/restore scrollTop.
[02:13:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we should decide which one is less invasive/more stable/more cross-browser, etc.
[02:13:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then we need two different branches for testing :)
[02:13:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah :/ Lotsa moving parts.

[05:57:06] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, Hi! Current Globalize description on https://github.com/jquery/globalize/ is:
[05:57:10] <rxaviers> JavaScript globalization and localization. Formats and parses strings, dates and numbers in over 350 cultures. http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Globalize
[05:57:19] <rxaviers> I was wondering if we could change that to:
[05:57:24] <rxaviers> JavaScript globalization and localization that leverage the official Unicode CLDR JSON data. Run in browsers and node.js.
[05:57:27] <rxaviers> Any thoughts?
[05:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine.
[05:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> perhaps keep the number reference though.
[05:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> "...CLDR JSON data, supporting over 350 cultures."
[05:59:16] <rxaviers> CLDR contains data for 238 languages and 259 territoriesâ€”740 locales in all.
[05:59:20] <rxaviers> Should we include that instead then?
[06:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just say "over 700 locales"
[06:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> Wouldn't want to include specifics as that will get out of sync easily.
[06:13:37] <tj_vantoll> Can someone on Windows try to recreate this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9769 I've tried on my Windows 8 machine and a Windows 7 VM and I can't.
[06:14:02] <rxaviers> ok
[06:17:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, I guess you would have to make such change please, or grant me some more access to the repo in order for me to do that.
[06:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the actual description, not the readme.
[06:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> What if we just reduce that to "JavaScript globalization and localization"
[06:26:02] <rxaviers> ok for me
[06:26:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi, I need to cherry-pick a commit into the 1-3 branch and then tag and redeploy the updated 1-3 docs... 
[06:26:56] <agcolom> I've prepared a gist: https://gist.github.com/agcolom/8649413
[06:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/agcolom/8649413#file-cherry-pick-and-deploy-and-old-branch-L14 is wrong
[06:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> That slash should be a space.
[06:27:50] <agcolom> changed
[06:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/agcolom/8649413#file-cherry-pick-and-deploy-and-old-branch-L15 shouldn't ever need to happen.
[06:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/agcolom/8649413#file-cherry-pick-and-deploy-and-old-branch-L25 is pushing the wrong branch. You just updated 1-3 not master.
[06:28:38] <agcolom> removed
[06:29:09] <agcolom> so git push --tags upstream 1-3 
[06:29:11] <agcolom> ?
[06:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[06:29:41] <agcolom> ok, I've updated it...
[06:29:48] <agcolom> Does that look ok now?
[06:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[06:30:15] <agcolom> Thanks!
[06:30:22] <agcolom> Is there anything missing?
[06:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, if you're writing markdown in a gist, you need to name the file appropriately or pick the file type for it to actually get parsed.
[06:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> no
[06:31:12] <agcolom> oh... good idea... I didn't know
[06:31:20] <agcolom> Thank you!

[08:46:04] <kborchers> is anyone working on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9769 tj_vantoll scott_gonzalez or just waiting on more info? got a similar report from jenn schiffer just now and asked her to comment on the bug so it seems legit
[08:46:21] <kborchers> if no one is working on it i can try to dig in tonight
[08:46:57] <tj_vantoll> kborchers: I can't recreate the problem.
[08:47:32] <kborchers> tj_vantoll: jenn says she sees that exact issue on win 7/64 on chrome 32
[08:47:54] <kborchers> she said everywhere else works fine
[08:48:27] <tj_vantoll> I tried on my Windows 8 machine and on a Windows 7 VM and I can't recreate it. If you can it'd be great if you could comment and try to figure out what's going on :)
[08:49:13] <kborchers> ok, i'll see what i can do tonight
[09:13:14] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, kborchers, I guess you have already thought about this. But, saying anyway... Isn't it something that browserstack could help with? They have win7 OS, and chrome 32. (although, they don't mention any other info about their win7, and I couldn't find out)
[09:14:50] <rxaviers> (about 32 vs 64)
[09:16:56] <tj_vantoll> rxaviers: I tried BrowserStack. I couldn't recreate it there.

[12:45:46] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#1272 (master - 3a22e02 : Scott GonzÃ¡lez): The build was broken.

[13:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> Grunt should have a concept of fail vs. error.
[13:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> So that Travis can properly report that as a build error not a failure.

[13:23:23] <gseguin> arschmitz: what's up?
[13:23:30] <arschmitz> gseguin: just wondering if you had looked at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7006 
[13:23:36] <arschmitz> or given it any thought
[13:23:43] <gseguin> I didn't. 
[13:23:47] <gseguin> now I have
[13:24:07] <gseguin> yeah there isn't much I can do besides submitting a PR to have an option "force"
[13:24:14] <gseguin> I can do that
[13:25:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah id be inclined to remove coveralls if we can work around
[13:25:39] <gseguin> what do you mean, remove?
[13:25:42] <arschmitz> gseguin: its failed 4 of the last 6 builds
[13:25:46] <gseguin> hmm
[13:25:56] <gseguin> sorry I wasn't monitoring it
[13:26:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem
[13:27:01] <arschmitz> but if it fails all the time for no reason its doing more harm then good for out testing
[13:28:14] <gseguin> agreed
[13:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> Is there more detailed data than https://coveralls.io/r/jquery/jquery-mobile?

[13:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, something actually useful.
[13:30:36] <scott_gonzalez> Or is it purely a percent of total coverage?
[13:30:46] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: there is per file
[13:30:56] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: https://coveralls.io/builds/470285
[13:31:01] <gseguin> at the bottom
[13:31:22] <gseguin> then click on the filename
[13:31:50] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[13:31:51] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> What is the color scheme?
[13:33:11] <gseguin> it's based on their own thresholds
[13:33:21] <gseguin> it may be documented somewhere
[13:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://coveralls.io/files/124849741#L147
[13:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> How is line 152 not green?
[13:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://coveralls.io/files/124849741#L161 Why is there a mixture of red and white?
[13:34:25] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: that probably is due to istanbul more than coveralls
[13:34:54] <gseguin> oh I guess red is when it's not been hit and green otherwise
[13:35:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: what about white?
[13:35:28] <gseguin> no metrics (pure guess)
[13:36:44] <gseguin> I believe coveralls just reads the istanbul metrics so I would blame istanbul
[13:37:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: also https://coveralls.io/files/124849741#L161 you can possibly run this line and not the line below it
[13:37:46] <arschmitz> cant*
[13:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yes you can.
[13:38:22] <gseguin> arschmitz: not true. The variable assignment happen
[13:38:26] <gseguin> not the execution
[13:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> 161 runs on parse.
[13:38:37] <arschmitz> oh yeah your right now
[13:38:49] <arschmitz> sory
[13:39:07] <arschmitz> was not thinking about parsing 
[13:43:43] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez, arschmitz: when running tests locally you can see the results in build/report/coverage
[13:44:27] <gseguin> these should match the ones on coveralls.io
[13:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: My concern isn't coveralls-specific.
[13:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone looked at this data since coverage reports were added?
[13:45:24] <gseguin> I wonder if there is a way to tell istanbul to report lines with commas in them
[13:45:59] <gseguin> I personally haven't because I haven't written tests but the next time I do, I will
[13:47:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[13:49:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wanted to talk more about events tests
[13:49:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure ... go ahead!
[13:50:26] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7000/files#diff-1d31fec459e96661cca3121b65db9969R452
[13:50:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right now i have this test commented out because changing the defaults breaks its assumption like we talked about
[13:51:25] <arschmitz> iv looked at fixing it a few ways and it really seems to do it right at all the whole file needs TONS of work
[13:52:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we modify prototypes like its going out of style
[13:53:02] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[13:53:03] <arschmitz> and never revert these changes
[13:53:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so my thinking is rather then just try to get this fixed 
[13:54:07] <arschmitz> just comment out the one test and make an issue to fix these tests for 1.5
[13:54:45] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's a good plan.
[13:55:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and for the one commented out test i add 3 new ones
[13:55:39] <_|Nix|_> I can make the issue and start a branch with that spare commit of mine. Then I can make a PR towards which we can contribute to fix that issue.
[13:55:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure
[13:56:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What exactly shall be the scope of the issue? I want it to be more specific than just "Fix event tests".
[13:56:39] <arschmitz> to fix that specific file
[13:56:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we want to eliminate prototype overrides entirely?
[13:56:50] <arschmitz> to not perminitly modify prototypes
[13:57:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no but any that are done need to be reverted after
[13:57:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so we wanna modify protos, but we wanna make sure the modifications are bracketed between setup and teardown, right?
[13:57:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[13:58:00] <_|Nix|_> ... and I would add to that the removal of unnecessary event listeners.
[13:58:04] <arschmitz> in many of these cases we probably should be using trigger data rather then protos at all 
[13:58:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've run the tests with my commit applied (which turns a bunch of .bind()s into .one()s) and the tests all passed.
[13:58:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I agree.
[13:58:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool 
[13:58:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what i wanted to do for this test
[13:59:20] <arschmitz> but it was a nightmare of previousy modified changes messing up the data
[13:59:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TBH, this is exactly why I created detailedEventSequence ...
[13:59:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[14:00:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv been writing tests like crazy
[14:00:39] <_|Nix|_> But anyway ... I think the best way forward is to merge your coord fix PR, then branch off for the cleanup PR.
[14:01:36] <arschmitz> i just finished fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6885
[14:01:49] <arschmitz> that once change i ended up adding 20 tests
