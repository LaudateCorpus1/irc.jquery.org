[11:02:29] <gnarf> happy bday jzaefferer
[23:02:03] <gnarf> ajpiano: yt?
[23:04:17] <gnarf> i dunno if anyone is actually awake in here
[23:04:35] <gnarf> friday nights are usually pretty slow in -dev ;)
[23:04:46] <gnarf> we have our meetings wednesday noon ET
[23:05:00] <jonathansampson> No problem. I'll be there for the meeting. I was this last week.
[23:06:16] <gnarf> right now I'm just looking at like the autocomplete docs
[23:06:59] <jonathansampson> Where are you?
[23:07:06] <jonathansampson> Github?
[23:07:09] <gnarf> and trying to model "blind.xml"
[23:07:25] <gnarf> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-docs/blob/master/jquery-ui/accordion/accordion.xml
[23:07:35] <gnarf> there is also the xml dump from api
[23:07:37] <gnarf> have you seen that?
[23:08:48] <jonathansampson> Looking now.
[23:08:50] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/api/
[23:09:00] <gnarf> thats like all the standard jquery methods
[23:11:27] <jonathansampson> This is awesome. I had no idea you guys were this detailed with the docs :)
[23:11:45] <jonathansampson> awesome++;
[23:12:54] <gnarf> jonathansampson: the current docs for jquery ui are on a completely different system
[23:13:07] <gnarf> but we are working (with the 1.9 rewrite) to bring them all into the same system
[23:13:31] <jonathansampson> And you said they reside in WordPress?
[23:14:09] <gnarf> jonathansampson: the current api for core does
[23:14:13] <gnarf> i'm not sure about UI
[23:15:52] <jonathansampson> Cool; I'll have to catch up with you later to see if I can help out a bit. You on Skype?
