[07:53:21] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, updates https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1335#issuecomment-63083896
[07:53:30] <rxaviers> please, just let me know if you want me to change anything
[07:53:49] <rxaviers> I'm updating the tests for other components
[07:53:51] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, ^
[07:53:53] <rxaviers> arschmitz, ^
[07:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Just FYI: I'm avoiding these discussions as much as possible.
[07:54:55] <scott_gonzalez> I honestly don't want to involve myself is module loading discussions anymore.
[07:58:22] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok np, just wanted to broadcast that
[09:31:55] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: here now: anyway, there were effects that were supposed to effect layout: blind and fold
[09:32:09] <mikesherov> old makes sense, because you can't configure it so that it's revealing from the bottom up
[09:32:13] <mikesherov> fold*
[09:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, blind right with layout is strange.
[09:32:45] <mikesherov> owever, blinding up OR right is super weird if it effects layout during the animation
[09:32:45] <mikesherov> right, both of those are super weird
[09:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess it would have the same layout effect as left, it just depends which side is visually disappearing.
[09:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> Basically, does it looke like the element is sliding into the top/right/bottom/left.
[09:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure it's weird to see though.
[09:34:14] <mikesherov> blind up, if it has a relative element floating underneath it
[09:34:31] <mikesherov> basically, that element immediately goes to the top and animates downward
[09:34:54] <mikesherov> like the blind itself looks great
[09:34:54] <mikesherov> it's other elements that go bonkers
[09:35:13] <mikesherov> although, same problem exists if I float right with fold :-\
[09:35:33] <mikesherov> the more I think about it, the more it seems like placeholder should never animate
[09:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> Why does the relative positioning affect it? Does it not use clip and a placeholder?
[09:35:52] <mikesherov> it does use a placeholder
[09:36:01] <mikesherov> so, all animations now use palceholder
[09:36:06] <mikesherov> and so none effect layout
[09:36:26] <mikesherov> then, when you reviewed it, you were like "see, it's supposed to effect layout for fold and blind"
[09:36:34] <mikesherov> so now I'm doing that last piece
[09:36:55] <mikesherov> animating the placeholder for fold and blind
[09:37:06] <mikesherov> all animations have the placeholder immediately set to the final dimensions as soon as the animation start
[09:37:19] <mikesherov> but changing that for fold and blind has led to some weird situations
[09:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we had the placeholder set to the original (start) size.
[09:39:43] <mikesherov> yes
[09:39:56] <mikesherov> that's true
[09:39:57] <mikesherov> in the case of "show", it's the final
[09:40:26] <mikesherov> but yeah, the original start size
[09:40:47] <mikesherov> the point is, it was considering a bug by you that the new implementation of "fold" and "blind" didn't effect layout
[09:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't undersand why relative elements under the animated element would jump.
[09:40:56] <mikesherov> they don't currently
[09:41:05] <mikesherov> unless I actually try to animate the placeholder too
[09:41:21] <mikesherov> which you seemed to wanted when you first reviewed this all those months ago
[09:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> But what's causing them to jump by animating the placeholder?
[09:41:48] <mikesherov> for fold, nothing
[09:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't the placeholder still taking up space (not floated, not absolute)
[09:42:17] <mikesherov> in the current master implementation, blinding up or blinding right does weird stuff too
[09:42:20] <mikesherov> let me fiddle you
[09:42:30] <mikesherov> yes, it takes up space
[09:42:34] <mikesherov> let me show you
[09:47:24] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/zL0xodke/1/
[09:47:30] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: that's current master
[09:47:37] <mikesherov> just hit run
[09:47:39] <mikesherov> blind up
[09:48:13] <mikesherov> the element underneath gets killed
[09:48:59] <mikesherov> it jumps to the bottom and animates up
[09:49:09] <mikesherov> blind down and blind right are great
[09:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> I see the blue line moving down.
[09:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> But animating floated element seems odd anyway.
[09:51:16] <mikesherov> ok, so then the question is, do you want fold and blind to animate the placeholder or not?
[09:51:16] <mikesherov> current master does, current rewrite does not
[09:51:27] <mikesherov> but I'm working on getting it to animate now
[09:52:06] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[09:52:33] <mikesherov> I have fold done, but blind seemed weird, so I stopped to ask you :-)
[09:53:14] <mikesherov> remember, effecting layout ONLY is important for things effected by layout, so the float case isn't a moot point
[09:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can have blind not animate the placeholder and see if we get bug reports.
[09:55:23] <mikesherov> I can do it either way...
[09:55:41] <mikesherov> maybe it's best not to break backcompat?
[09:56:11] <mikesherov> there doesn't seem to be any reports about current blind and fold behavior, is there?
[09:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[09:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's hard to say what we should do here. I think I'm fine with either.
[10:00:45] <mikesherov> ok, so then, I'll do it
[10:01:04] <mikesherov> I'll make it match the weird up and right case from blind
[10:01:10] <mikesherov> for consistency sake
