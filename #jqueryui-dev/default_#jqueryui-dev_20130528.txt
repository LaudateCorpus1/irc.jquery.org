[06:03:44] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez So only use -x when going into a release (e.g. 1-10-stable) branch?
[06:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> Now the commit in master has a reference to a commit that's only in your branch.
[06:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> So most people won't be able to resolve that SHA to a commit.
[06:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> It will, however, live indefinitely on GitHub since you sent a pull request.
[06:04:48] <tj_vantoll> I see. But if's it in master the SHA1 will refer to a commit in the master branch.
[06:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> right
[06:05:26] <tj_vantoll> Ok, makes sense. Wow I put the "'s" on "if" instead of "it", might be a long day.
[06:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:30:03] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez you going to jsconf?
[07:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[07:32:55] <Dave_Stein> booooo  
[07:33:00] <Dave_Stein> ;)

[08:12:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ping
[08:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[08:15:26] <rxaviers> Do you need release script to place/generate the release (or pre-release) files inside __release/repo? I understood it's used in a later step, manually. If so, could I place those files in a different path, like __release/xx.zip?
[08:15:49] <rxaviers> (instead of __release/repo/dist/xx.zip)
[08:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> It can be anywhere, as long as it's inside __release
[08:16:57] <rxaviers> ok. You take that .zip manually to upload to cdns, right?
[08:17:06] <rxaviers> (currently)
[08:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> At some point, we'll automate the update of our CDN, but that happens from the unzipped files.
[08:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> The zip gets manually sent to Google and Microsoft.
[08:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> Right now everything that happens with the built files is manual, so moving it can't break anything :-)
[08:18:34] <rxaviers> excellent, thanks
[08:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> Regarding your question about docs, we can't move the API docs.
[08:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> We'll just have the manifest expose a list of additional docs files to include.
[10:03:07] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok just let me know how manifest will look like. Another option is to leave manifest as it is, I could add an if-exception on DB.
[10:03:15] <rxaviers> we are not getting rid of them anyway...
[10:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> We are getting rid of them.
[10:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> The goal is to not hit any of the conditions with 1.11.
[10:18:38] <_zoggy_> http://cdnjs.com/
[10:19:30] <_zoggy_> noticed that they are hosting jquery there too now
[10:21:21] <rxaviers> ok. just let me know how you want manifest to be. I remeber we cant change docs to become an array. Are we using a new field?
[10:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, I'm hoping to not actually have it go into the manifest files though.
[10:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to just have jquery-ui expose the raw data via a script.
[10:49:27] <rxaviers> ok
[10:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll be able to require() a file in jquery-ui and get back what's basically an enhanced manifest file.
[10:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> So it'd be everything in the generated files + some additional info.
[11:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> Did Adobe really just release a gray on gray CSS framework? http://topcoat.io/topcoat/doc/desktop.html
[11:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> What's up with designers that hate contrast?
[11:46:09] <tj_vantoll> Surprisingly it's actually pretty good contrast: http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#%23DFE2E2-on-%233a3f42
[11:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> It must be all the disabled coloring on that page.
[11:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> Plus the super tiny font size.
[11:50:40] <tj_vantoll> Themeroller's form is a bit gray on gray with small font sizes :) http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[11:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> You've never heard me say that I like the TR interface ;-)
[11:51:53] <tj_vantoll> :)
[11:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> I actually find it frustrating and would love to sit down and redesign it if we weren't also trying to figure out how the hell to merge theming with Mobile.
[11:55:13] <tj_vantoll> Heh, mobile's uses gray on gray with small text as well...
[11:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> Go figure.
[11:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> FG built UI's so....
[11:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> Theirs is better than ours though.
[11:56:36] <tj_vantoll> Yeah for sure.
[11:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't like the medium gray on light gray, but at least the settings and preview scroll independently.
[11:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's one thing that drives me nutes.
[11:57:20] <tj_vantoll> Being able to use the full width of the page helps.
[11:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> s/nutes/nuts/
[11:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> We could just make that one small change though.
[11:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...at a certain width, our TR gets messed up.
[11:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> The preview section drops below the controls.
[11:58:58] <tj_vantoll> Yeah was just playing with that.
[11:59:29] <tj_vantoll> If they scrolled independently that should take care of that though too.
[12:40:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Do we need to open an issue for the way code looks on the meeting site or the issue you showed me covers that?
[12:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> The issue covers it.
[12:41:39] <agcolom> ok, great!
[12:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually working on it right now.
[12:41:53] <agcolom> btw that grey on great looks totally depressing!
[12:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> So many designers like gray on gray. I hate it.
[12:42:20] <agcolom> It's horrible! 
[12:42:30] <agcolom> I hate it too! I like colours! 
[12:42:37] <agcolom> (oh colors ;-) )
[12:43:55] <kborchers> agcolom: thank you for correcting to the proper spelling of color ;)
[12:44:30] <agcolom> I have to be careful! I really have a go at students when they use american spelling ;-) 
[12:44:42] <kborchers> :)
[12:45:36] <agcolom> And for some reason all office tools default to american spelling :-)
[12:46:21] <kborchers> there must be a reason for that ‚Ä¶ :D
[12:47:37] <agcolom> I think it is to the British people SOOOOO frustrated :-)
[12:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's always fun using undocumented APIs...
[12:52:13] <agcolom> which one?
[12:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> The markdown module that we use for building our sites has a public API for getting the results of the lexer.
[12:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> So you can go from markdown -> tokens -> HTML.
[12:52:53] <agcolom> oh I see! 
[12:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> But there's no documentation about the tokens.
[12:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> And we do some custom stuff where we merge tokens and generate our own tokens.
[12:55:00] <agcolom> I feel the pain for you!
[12:55:07] <agcolom> (but not sure that helps ;-) )
[12:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I *think* this code works with the new version.
[12:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really want to generate diffs for each page of every site.
[12:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> You gotta love when you spend an hour on something, write a bunch of code, then realize you can reduce it to one line of code...
[12:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> Like this: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/commit/ce94f6f58e72a1184c1a5f5cb94997b671d1c6dc
[12:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> Took me a while just to figre out what tokens.links was.
[12:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't help that it was always empty on our pages.
[12:59:22] <agcolom> Well if that makes you feel better, you probably are part of the top 1% of the people who know this ;-)
[13:06:22] <agcolom> is that what generates the links based on the filename?
[13:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> links based on filename?
[13:07:25] <agcolom> in the meeting section the filename define the page?
[13:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> No, that's just how grunt-wordpress is built.
[13:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> The filename is outside the scope of markdown.
[13:08:25] <agcolom> so 2012-05-31.md  is http://meetings.jquery.org/2012-05-31-mobile/
[13:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> The build process for that repo generate a file named 2012-05-31-mobile.html and grunt-wordpress syncs that and uses the file name as the slug.
[13:09:29] <agcolom> right.... nice... 
[13:09:52] <agcolom> so the tokens.links where is that used? (on the learn site?)
[13:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's used internally by the markdown parser.
[13:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> This is the undocumented APIs complaint.
[13:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> marked.lexer() returns a set of tokens.
[13:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> We mess with those tokens.
[13:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> But the tokens now contain a links property, which isn't documented.
[13:13:36] <agcolom> oh, I see! 
[13:13:52] <agcolom> so you didn't know they had a links property?
[13:14:05] <agcolom> (is that new?)
[13:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's either new or the module worked without the property before.
[13:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> But now it throws an error if it doesn't exist.
[13:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> And our custom code didn't have it before.
[13:16:20] <agcolom> That sounds crazy! 
[13:17:52] <agcolom> Well done for figuring out how to fix it!
