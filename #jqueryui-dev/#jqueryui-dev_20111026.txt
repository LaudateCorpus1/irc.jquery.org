[08:05:43] <kborchers> i hate tables!!
[08:05:46] <kborchers> especially in IE
[08:05:55] <kborchers> anyone want to help me with some CSS?
[08:07:09] <gnarf> if i can
[08:07:24] <kborchers> ok so i'm working menubar
[08:07:42] <kborchers> here is chrome, safari, ff http://gyazo.com/b395c13d16c0eb7a1645dd9e5bca13e3
[08:07:51] <kborchers> top is div bottom is table based
[08:07:55] <kborchers> looks great
[08:08:12] <kborchers> IE9 http://gyazo.com/09308ce7964d9410631b23d9472282b6
[08:08:22] <kborchers> IE8 http://gyazo.com/32fdaf320a2e84c8f2589b019f163d48
[08:08:45] <kborchers> sorry IE9 was 8 and IE8 was 7
[08:08:53] <kborchers> and IE6 http://gyazo.com/86aabda23c1da32ef31387a1742d63f4
[08:09:18] <gnarf> woah
[08:09:33] <gnarf> f'n IE
[08:09:40] <kborchers> here is CSS https://gist.github.com/1316635
[08:10:21] <kborchers> 8 and 9 look the same so no IE's look right. the rest are perfect
[08:10:50] <gnarf> so the ui-menubar-item is the row?
[08:10:52] <kborchers> IE6 is the best one right ... it even messes with the UL and DIV based menubars
[08:10:56] <kborchers> yes
[08:11:39] <gnarf> you might be arguing with the default displays for table cells
[08:11:52] <gnarf> like display: table-row; and display: table-cell
[08:12:07] <gnarf> the float left feels really odd
[08:14:12] <kborchers> yeah ... but that works in all browsers but IE
[08:14:20] <kborchers> old IE at least
[08:18:11] <gnarf> im so clueless here
[08:18:48] <kborchers> me too

[08:52:07] <scott_gonzalez> well, I mean it depends on what you want to do
[08:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> if you want the full functionality of changing options, then no
[08:52:23] <kborchers> do we ever use browser specific CSS rules? specifically for IE6?

[08:56:20] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by maljub01 (1w, 1d ago): Fixed ticket #7800 - Draggable helper="clone" doesn't remove the dragged clone if original element is removed upon drop
[08:59:38] <Dave_Stein> working, just say my name when youre up to drag
[09:00:22] <rworth> Dave_Stein: you mean in #jquery-meeting ?
[09:00:55] <jzaefferer> speaking of that, -meeting is muted
[09:01:10] <jzaefferer> pinged gnarf
[09:01:13] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah whoops
[09:01:23] <maljub01> hello?
[09:09:46] <gnarf> hi
[09:12:05] <maljub01> gnarf: Hi, I was wondering if anyone got the chance to look at my pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/501
[09:12:06] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by maljub01 (1w, 1d ago): Fixed ticket #7800 - Draggable helper="clone" doesn't remove the dragged clone if original element is removed upon drop
[09:12:43] <jzaefferer> maljub01: nope, otherwise there would be activity on the pull request
[09:13:06] <jzaefferer> one reason might be that Dave_Stein is working on a rewrite of draggable
[09:13:11] <gnarf> maljub01: thats in a section of code that is being rewritten anyway, might pull it into the stable branch, but draggable is going to be 100% new code soon
[09:13:15] <jzaefferer> so landing bug fixes has not a high priority
[09:13:33] <jzaefferer> also bugfixes can cause more regressions
[09:13:45] <maljub01> jzaefferer: oh, I see. Well, the other thing is that the bug that I fixed is also in the current stable version.
[09:14:16] <maljub01> jzaefferer: and I didn't want to create two identical tickets for each branch
[09:14:46] <jzaefferer> yeah, fixing in stable might make sense
[09:15:08] <jzaefferer> could you make the PR against 1-8-stable?
[09:15:14] <jzaefferer> and actually test with that...
[09:15:26] <jzaefferer> up to scott_gonzalez in the end to land it
[09:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> interaction fixes should be against master, not 1-8-stable
[09:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> but as jzaefferer said, bug fixes in interactions are very low priority
[09:17:35] <maljub01> I see.
[09:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> they have a huge potential for regressions because the code isn't tested and is very fragile
[09:18:30] <maljub01> sorry for pestering. It's my first contribution and I was anxious
[09:19:28] <gnarf> maljub01: best bet is to ask before you start working on a bug :)
[09:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[09:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> the situation with interactions right now is really unfortunate
[09:21:12] <maljub01> well, I worked on this bug fix because I needed it in an application I'm working on.
[09:21:37] <maljub01> I wanted to write tests but wasn't sure how I can drag-and-drop using js.
[09:23:29] <rworth> maljub01: you can use the simulate plugin, see the draggable unit test suite for some examples
[09:24:35] <maljub01> rworth: thanks. will do.
[09:52:36] <gnarf> kborchers: toddparker is talking over in mobile dev, maybe he might be able to help with that CSS issue :)
[10:09:49] <toddparker> hello
[10:10:01] <toddparker> what's up?
[10:13:46] <gnarf> kborchers: you still here?
[10:13:49] <gnarf> darnit! :)
[10:14:17] <gnarf> kborchers: was struggling with some css stuff, relating to tables and ui-menubar
[10:14:29] <gnarf> ie was giving him hell
[10:15:01] <kborchers> i'm back
[10:15:19] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/d6766167fc6c8e766727
[10:15:30] <gnarf> toddparker: that reviews the problem :)
[10:16:23] <kborchers> yeah ... basically an issue with trying to display table rows horizontally next to each other.
[10:16:52] <kborchers> the float: left works great for all browsers except IE8, 7 and 6 which ignore it.
[10:17:00] <kborchers> then there are some extra space issues
[11:05:46] <toddparker> that is tricky
[11:06:11] <toddparker> if you can post the code where,w e can try to take a look in the next few days
[11:11:41] <kborchers> toddparker: ok, i'm about to head to a meeting but i'll get this pushed up to my repo and then create a fiddle based off that for you to play with.
[11:11:47] <kborchers> i'll ping you later with the link
[11:11:48] <kborchers> thanks
[11:18:06] <toddparker> thanks
[12:37:04] <Scott__> I have a quick question regarding jquery.ui.tooltip.js.  Does it require the tooltip target to have a title attribute?
[12:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> no, it depends on the items and content options
[12:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> by default it shows tooltips for elements with a title attribute and uses the title attribute for the content
[12:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> view the demos to see how it works
[12:39:33] <Scott__> I've looked very closely at the demos, although perhaps I've missed something.  What do I set the items option to in order to avoid it using the title?
[12:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> the items option defines what gets a tooltip, the content option decides what the content is
[12:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> view-source:http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/tooltip/custom-content.html
[12:41:45] <Scott__> For some reason, this is the only way I can get it to work:  https://gist.github.com/1317555
[12:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> please provide an actual test page showing the problem that you're having
[12:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> that gist doesn't show any problems
[12:43:11] <Scott__> Ok, sorry, will do.
[13:31:45] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: should tooltip throw an error if you change the content option without changing the items option? seems like that could catch an issue a lot of people will encounter
[13:32:21] <jzaefferer> only scenario where that sucks is if you use the content option to apply custom formatting (header, paragraphs) to the title attribute
[13:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> no
[13:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> we should document it really well though
[13:32:58] <jzaefferer> so how can we avoid endless support requests for the "I changed the content option and now my tooltips don't work" issue?
[13:33:16] <jzaefferer> when people only read far enough to pick up the content option...
[13:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> added a comment to the wiki
[13:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> we can document it in the overview and in both option descriptions
[13:33:52] <jzaefferer> k
[14:17:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so getting menubar (and i'm sure menu when i get there) to work with tables is a pain
[14:17:48] <kborchers> were you thinking the menubar items would be the tr's or td's?
[14:18:21] <kborchers> i have it working now with the tr's but IE hates it and won't float them like the other browsers
[14:19:19] <kborchers> if i change to td's it would probably work better but then do i assume there is only one row or make a menubar for each row?
[15:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> they'd be the trs
[15:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually not concerned about a table for menubar
[15:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> just for menu
[19:12:18] <kborchers> .
[19:16:39] <gnarf> hey kborchers
[19:16:59] <kborchers> hey
[19:18:42] <kborchers> so i was never able to get that fiddle together for todd
[19:19:17] <kborchers> damn IE doesn't like the mime types that come from some of the files when you include pieces of ui straight from github
[19:20:01] <gnarf> boo
[19:20:17] <gnarf> why not include the css in the fiddle window?
[19:21:11] <kborchers> i did ... it's the actual js files it doesn't like ... but only a couple of them
[19:37:41] <Dave_Stein> hey
[19:37:43] <Dave_Stein> just got home
[19:37:44] <Dave_Stein> what a night
[19:38:09] <Dave_Stein> are we skypin or chattin?
[19:40:11] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: *yawn*
[19:41:33] <gnarf> either
[19:41:38] <gnarf> im busy with a jQuery bug atm
[19:41:39] <gnarf> so like
[19:41:49] <gnarf> you had upstream as a remote right?
[19:41:50] <Dave_Stein> o
[19:42:08] <gnarf> you should be able to push to upstream now
[19:42:09] <Dave_Stein> you mean with the permissions i just got?
[19:42:15] <gnarf> keep to your interactions branch
[19:42:26] <gnarf> don't go merging pulls or other random stuff :)
[19:42:34] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[19:42:37] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: i mean on your repo
[19:42:39] <Dave_Stein> of course not :)
[19:42:39] <gnarf> git remote
[19:42:43] <gnarf> does it show origin ?
[19:42:46] <gnarf> and upstream
[19:43:03] <Dave_Stein> hold on gotta see that
[19:43:05] <Dave_Stein> didnt even startup git
[19:43:18] <Dave_Stein> i think my hard drives are dying... i should look into that
[19:43:26] <Dave_Stein> its like hanging my stuff just from hitting control panel
[19:43:34] <Dave_Stein> and my cd rom drive skeeps opening and closing at will ha
[19:43:59] <Dave_Stein> when i type git remote i just see origin
[19:44:57] <gnarf> so you want to git remote add upstream git@github.com:jquery/jquery-ui.git
[19:45:30] <gnarf> then you should be able to git checkout interactions ; git push upstream interactions
[19:45:55] <Dave_Stein> so that puts interactions onto the main line?>
[19:46:10] <Dave_Stein> yup its there
[19:46:18] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/interactions
[19:46:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] DaveStein created interactions (+16 new commits): http://git.io/lCz5ew
[19:46:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/interactions] Draggable: Initial commit for new implementation, clone is only usable option - Dave Stein
[19:46:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/interactions] Draggable: Code style better matching style guideline - Dave Stein
[19:46:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/interactions] whitespace - Scott González
[19:46:44] <gnarf> so now you can just push stuff there
[19:46:57] <Dave_Stein> so i should work on my fork and then when things are good push upstream
[19:47:09] <Dave_Stein> or should i be working on the main line and working inside interactions
[19:47:15] <Dave_Stein> by "main line" im not sure of the terminology
[19:47:21] <Dave_Stein> the opposite of the fork :)
[19:47:35] <gnarf> you should prolly just switch to using upstream as your main repo for this branch
[19:47:53] <Dave_Stein> okay so you know the dumb question is coming of how do i do that
[19:48:10] <gnarf> instead of git push / pull to origin, just push/pull to upstream instead
[19:48:24] <gnarf> i believe you can set up a "tracking" branch - i have to google how every time tho
[19:48:33] <gnarf> so the other benifit this has
[19:48:41] <kborchers> VIEW!!!
[19:48:52] <Dave_Stein> so i can still push to my fork if i do push origin, but push upstream goes to main line
[19:49:19] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/interactions/tests/visual/draggable/draggable.html
[19:49:34] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: yup
[19:49:42] <Dave_Stein> interesting
[19:49:49] <Dave_Stein> yeah i know i gotta look how you guys do the visual tests
[19:49:54] <Dave_Stein> and then ill get one setup
[19:50:51] <gnarf> that interactions link is up now btw
[19:51:00] <gnarf> i think that cron runs every 5/10 minutes
[19:51:06] <Dave_Stein> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js
[19:51:11] <Dave_Stein> is that hanging for you?
[19:51:20] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/interactions/tests/visual/draggable/draggable.html :)
[19:51:34] <Dave_Stein> did you make that there?
[19:51:45] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: nah, thats still there
[19:51:50] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/interactions/tests/visual/draggable/
