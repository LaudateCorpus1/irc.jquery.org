[03:52:05] <muzone_> Why are jQuery / jQuery UI's CSS selectors structured-like-this and not structured_like_this which is normal?
[03:52:18] <muzone_> I was at this jQuery convention the other day and me and the guys joked a lot about it - how painful it is to always go and manually rename all the CSS selectors in jQuery / jQuery UI just to make them fit with our own CSS which use underscores and not dashes
