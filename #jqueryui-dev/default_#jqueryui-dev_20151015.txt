[04:06:00] <januschh> scott_gonzales: Thank your for your reply! I don't understand why you say there is no 1.10.5 i have been using it with this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-ui
[04:06:50] <januschh> scott_gonzales: I'll go on following the upgrade path that you pointed me to, thank you! I hope I get it to work ;)
[04:14:33] <januschh> scott_gonzales: I just saw that it is actually 1.10.4 npm package owner must have changed the version 1.10.5
[04:32:16] <januschh> scott_gonzales: Hey, I just wanted to thank you once again! I got away from 1.10.5 the upgrade was pretty smooth, and webpack handles the bundling pretty well. I only need to upgrade the theme now, because everything looks wrong write now, but no JS bugs so far.

[11:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> That Travis failure is such a pain in the ass.
[11:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm out of ideas for trying to fix it.
