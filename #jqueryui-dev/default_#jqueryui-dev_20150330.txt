[08:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on AMD support with grunt-contrib-qunit.
[08:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a very interesting problem.
[08:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> Got a few minutes to look into it?
[08:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I figured it out.
[08:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I figured out part of it anyway.... At least I have a new path to go down.
[08:28:59] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: let me know how that goes...
[08:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it working :-)
[08:30:33] <jzaefferer> nice
[08:30:54] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: isn't it great how you want to implement one thing and then have to go into fixing dependencies for most of the time?
[08:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, lunch time at Panera... Always takes me a minute to realize I've lost wifi because the streaming music doesn't stop :-P
[08:35:22] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Despite removing the dependency on core and mobile, those redirect tests are still flaky. It's super weird ...

[09:45:58] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i saw was going to ping you
[11:28:07] <ashg1910> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/LEETDcGV
[11:28:56] <ashg1910> I tried grunt prepare at node_modules/download.jqueryui.com. It is working fine
[11:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> ashg1910: I haven't seen that problem before.
[11:30:55] <scott_gonzalez> There's not much we can do when we can't reproduce.
[11:32:08] <ashg1910> Is there any other way to build jqueryui.com locally?
[11:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> No, grunt deploy is the only way to build any site.
[11:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> What are you trying to work on?
[11:33:20] <ashg1910> nm, just wanted to build this and check if there are any issues which can be corrected :)
[11:37:05] <ashg1910> scott_gonzalez: The last task in deploying this is, wordpress-sync. Is there any way, I can run that independently?
[11:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> grunt wordpress-deploy
[11:38:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, not that.
[11:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> grunt wordpress-publish
[11:38:31] <scott_gonzalez> wordpress-deploy will rerun the actual building step.
[11:44:03] <ashg1910> grunt wordpress-publish works. Thanks. Deployed jqueryui! :D
