[16:26:45] <Sirisian|Work> Is there any developer here that could verify if I found a bug? I was playing with a really simple drag and drop example I wrote and noticed almost random behavior.
[16:30:28] <Sirisian|Work> https://jsfiddle.net/5dhfmmxf/4/ Drag the green onto the red and the red turns purple as expected. Drag the blue onto the green. Now try to drag the green onto the red again and no purple. Drag the blue onto the red and it will magically reset things so you can drag the green onto the red again.
