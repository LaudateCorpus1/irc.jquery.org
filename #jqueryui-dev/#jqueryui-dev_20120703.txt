[07:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano danheberden gnarf jzaefferer kborchers rworth: Any of you going to be around for the meeting tomorrow?
[07:06:28] <ajpiano> nope
[07:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Thoughts on what documentation we need to put on the plugins site?
[07:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/34
[07:07:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #34 on plugins.jquery.com (scottgonzalez; 3w, 4d ago): Figure out what documentation (on the site) needs to exist
[07:07:33] <ajpiano> i will put an outline up in here
[07:07:34] <ajpiano> on a skype right now
[07:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[07:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> Right now all we have is how to name your plugin: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/site-content/page/names.html
[07:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> We definitely need a page about how to setup the post-receive hook.
[07:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what other docs we'll need.
[07:09:34] <rworth> no, I don't think I'll be around
[08:03:14] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: we aren't currently enforcing that you *must* have unit tests, right
[08:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[08:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> We don't actually look at anything in the repo other than the manifest files.
[08:09:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i should be
[08:16:19] <speedy> hey guys, i'm trying to understand autocomplete code, and have a question about .data( "menu" ); line in the _create() method
[08:17:38] <speedy> i'm not sure why is it there at all.. looks like a bug to me
[08:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> speedy: It's not a bug, it returns the menu instance.
[08:48:20] <speedy> scott: thanks, it's a bit strange to access it via user defined properties..
[08:49:02] <speedy> (it's not really obvious that .menu() stores instance inside data() )
[08:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> All widgets store instances inside .data()
[08:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's not exactly user defined. The user has no control over it.
[08:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, a user could kill it, but they'd break the widget completely.
[09:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Forever won't do what we want (we can't tell it to stop watching a script without killing it).
[09:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want me to just build the functionality myself?
[09:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> It'd only be a fraction of what forever does, since we have a pretty small use case.
[09:07:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do whatever you need to... did you end up putting your ssh key on https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/ssh-keys yet? :)
[09:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'll do that now
[09:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> done
[09:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Based on responses, I assume only gnarf and I would be around tomorrow, so we won't have a meeting.
[09:11:27] <gnarf> it is the 4th after all
[09:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that's why I was asking :-)
[09:15:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what do you want your username to be on these boxes?
[09:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I get a username?
[09:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's a first in my history of working on jQuery servers :-P
[09:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> scottgonzalez is fine
[09:34:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I could probably make it, but skipping would be fine
[09:40:01] <gnarf> seems like a no meeting week anyway
[09:40:11] <gnarf> holidays, conf lang
[09:40:13] <gnarf> er lag
[09:40:13] <gnarf> etc
[09:40:18] <gnarf> anyway, bbiab - walking
[11:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/c380a9f2bc3aacc72268f3ea87eefd6659c1c982
[11:44:38] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on plugins.jquery.com by Scott González (2m, 48s ago): Added a manager script to run all three scripts and keep them alive.
[13:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Let me know when you're around.
[13:00:29] <nacin> yo scott_gonzalez
[13:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> I just ran the web-base-tempalte install script.
[13:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> Then I ran the plugins site setup script and then populated it with a few plugins.
[13:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> The index page showed what I expected, and so did a search.
[13:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> But when I clicked on a plugin from the search page, I got a 404.
[13:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> It took me to the correct URL, but no content.
[13:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> I then went into the admin and checked to verify that the install script set permalinks to postname.
[13:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> Just going there fixed the issue.
[13:02:54] <nacin> so going to that page flushes rewrite rules.
[13:03:08] <nacin> we may need to insert some code to cause a better re-generation of rules on install.
[13:03:16] <nacin> I couldn't reproduce last time I tried to do that.
[13:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> What would I need to do to test again? Just drop all tables from my db and do the install again?
[13:09:37] <nacin> yeah
[13:09:50] <nacin> I've had it happen to me, I just couldn't re-trigger it.
[13:10:29] <nacin> ah, I know why. I can take a look later today or tomorrow.
[13:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: thansk
[13:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> *thanks
[13:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Should jquery-color have a more verbose description?
[13:24:11] <gnarf> um
[13:24:15] <gnarf> you tell me :)
[13:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's grown beyond just a mere animation hook.
[13:28:26] <gnarf> yes - it prolly should
[16:07:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: along with getting big projects like Drupal to make more use of jQuery UI, another road may be to get app frameworks like ember and angularjs to offer integration. Those frameworks may have some overlap here and there, but for the most part aren't competing
[16:47:33] <gnarf> nacin: lol - nice catch
[16:47:39] <gnarf> .tweet gnarf37
[16:47:40] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from gnarf37: @darylkoop It's not in the logs, just ping me when yer on - I want you to look over something we talked about the other night. ★ http://bit.ly/LvPfNg
[16:47:49] <gnarf> .tweet nacin
[16:47:50] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from nacin: @a_j_r They both did. But there's a difference between getting a story dead wrong in every way, and having your story disagree with itself. ★ http://bit.ly/LvPg40

[16:48:04] <gnarf> damnit!
[16:48:10] <nacin> wow, you are struggling.

[16:49:18] <gnarf> there

[17:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Already on it. I've been working with Yehuda for ember integration and I asked an appendTo dev to look into Knockout integration.
[18:42:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: nice! I'll keep in touch with the AngularJS guy then and see about getting their UI module updated (its a year old)
