[08:48:18] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/position-notification] Position: Inline center variable. Not necessary with gzip (or a good minifier) in place, wasn't consistent with other inline strings - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:14:34] <jzaefferer> kborchers or scott_gonzalez, could you help me out with this? https://gist.github.com/81a9d535f7a72a496259
[09:15:24] <jzaefferer> the last two hunks still call within.offset() and scrollLeft/Top, I can't figure out how to refactor that so that flip and fit can both reuse the same values
[09:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's probably fine for now. We can always revisit again.
[09:33:02] <jzaefferer> Yeah, there's more to cleanup when we can use outerWidth on window… can we, eventually?

[09:34:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/position-notification] Position: Refactor within-data to avoid calculating that more then needed. Not quite done, but good enough for now - Jörn Zaefferer
[09:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, eventually :-)
