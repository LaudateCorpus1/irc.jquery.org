[08:09:45] <kborchers> baby had me up at 5 so wasn't a big deal for me
[08:10:20] <gnarf> heh
[08:10:51] <gnarf> i wish i had an alarm clock as useful as my own baby to wake me up in the mornin :)
[08:11:12] <kborchers> :)
[08:11:45] <gnarf> i had 3 alarms set to wake me up today, slept though all of them

[09:16:13] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer created position-notification (+1 new commit): http://git.io/fK4Kfg
[09:16:13] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/position-notification] Position: First draft for a new notification API, via using callback, telling you were the of-element is, not just when something flipped. New test page demonstrates usage - Jörn Zaefferer
[12:07:19] <gnarf> hrm
[12:07:26] <gnarf> dialog is annoying me right now
[12:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's up?
[12:09:24] <gnarf> i have a dialog open that I'm dynamically adding content to... is it possible to tell dialog to "reposition" itself given its current rules?
[12:10:02] <gnarf> i.e. the dynamic content is going over "maxHeight"
[12:11:01] <gnarf> also, it seems that when I add new content, it wont "recenter"
[12:11:10] <gnarf> i suppose i could close it then open it again and hope noone notices
[12:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> elem.dialog( "option", "position", elem.dialog( "option", "position" ) ) :-)
[12:13:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: will that do the max/minHeight again?
[12:14:09] <gnarf> hrm
[12:14:11] <gnarf> actuallly
[12:14:17] <gnarf> maxHeight doesn't seem to be supported option
[12:14:31] <gnarf> it works for the resizable
[12:14:36] <gnarf> but it doesn't stop the initial
[12:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I know. I never got around to implementing it :-P
[12:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry :-(
[12:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> I've been aware of it for a very long time: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4820
[12:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> Originally none of the resizable-related options were used for auto-height.
[12:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then I implemented minHeight and it was a huge pain.
[12:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm sure there's something hacky you can do like triggering mouse events on the resize handle :-P
[12:20:38] <gnarf> hrm
[12:30:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'm really not having any luck figuring out how to pull that off...
[12:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> Got a fiddle showing the problem?
[12:33:16] <gnarf> not yet
[12:33:19] <gnarf> gimmie 3 minutes
[12:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:37:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/WrwAY/2/
[12:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I'd expect that to work. I'll dig into it and see what's going on.
[12:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> On the other hand, if you're using jquery-ui-git, we could just fix this in master...
[12:40:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i am
[12:40:07] <gnarf> im using a custom built 1.9 pre
[12:40:33] <gnarf> and realistically, couldn't a maxHeight set on the dialog container do the job anyway?
[12:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> Possibly.
[12:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming you don't care about IE6.
[12:41:02] <gnarf> IE8 is my min IE target -- OMG YAY
[12:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[12:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> IE6 is the big pain, otherwise minHeight would've been easy.
[12:44:51] <gnarf> so, scott_gonzalez http://jsfiddle.net/KmJah/
[12:44:58] <gnarf> why isn't there a scrollbar on the content? :)
[12:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> Right, the problem there is that the content div just keeps growing. Because, umm...
[12:47:28] <gnarf> ui-dialog is overflow: hidden
[12:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> and ui-dialog-content is overflow: auto
[12:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll need to set the maxHeight on the content div, which needs to account for everything else...
[12:50:12] <gnarf> sigh
[12:50:52] <gnarf> so this kinda works yeah http://jsfiddle.net/KmJah/1/
[12:51:17] <gnarf> i just need to like wire that up to a value that makes sense - i just want to stop it from flowing out of the window
[12:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/KmJah/2/
[12:51:34] <gnarf> is the .ui-dialog-content the original <div> ?
[12:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
[12:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> So here's what I did...
[12:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> minHeight is set in CSS and it already accounts for the titlebar, button pane, padding etc.
[12:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> So if you take the difference of the minHeight option and the minHeight CSS, you can easily get the sum of all of that stuff.
[12:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> Then subtract that from the maxHeight option and you get the value you need for maxHeight CSS
[12:54:24] <gnarf> coo

[14:58:02] <Glutnix> hi, i'm wanting to write a new kind of droppable tolerance into jquery-ui and wanted to bounce the idea off someone...
[14:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> Glutnix: What's the idea?
[15:01:50] <Glutnix> I want to have a drag anchor on draggables ( different from drag handle ) and have the tolerance be the intersection of the droppable and the draggable's drag anchor
[15:02:18] <Glutnix> anchor could be an element or a point i guess
[15:02:25] <Glutnix> but an element is more helpful
[15:19:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to position-notification: http://git.io/Yzcg2w
[15:19:50] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/position-notification] Position: Mini refactoring, avoids proxying using callback multiple times if more then one element is positioned - Jörn Zaefferer
[15:21:01] <Glutnix> scott_gonzalez: what do you think?
[15:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> Glutnix: Do you have examples of this actually being done in existing UIs?
[15:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> Seems pretty similar to the pointer intersection.
[15:25:09] <Glutnix> Scratch does this. I'm actually trying to replicate Scratch in JS with jQuery UI
[15:25:19] <Glutnix> http://scratch.mit.edu
[15:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Do I need to create an account to use that?
[15:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> Or can I just download it and use it without an account?
[15:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I only have about 2 more minutes before I have to go.
[15:27:28] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm in here every day.
[15:29:44] <Glutnix> yeah, it's a free download, no account required.
[15:30:41] <Glutnix> the reason it's not similar to pointer intersection is that i could be dragging it from one end of the element, but the drag anchor is at the other end
[15:35:13] <Glutnix> brb
