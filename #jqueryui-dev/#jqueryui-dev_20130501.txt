[04:23:56] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Do we now have a "warning" class for "warning divs" ?
[04:24:39] <agcolom> (to do something like the orientation timing warning shown here: http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/orientationchange/ 
[04:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> No, but we can easily add one.
[04:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Do you have an example of a warning like that from core?
[04:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> I guess http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[04:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> We should have consistent styling.
[04:29:58] <agcolom> I agree :)
[04:30:37] <agcolom> there's also http://api.jquery.com/val/
[05:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> you're doing it wrong http://rtsinani.github.io/jquery-datepicker-skins/
[05:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> On the bright side, people are skinning UI components.
[05:10:03] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, that's about all we have. it's not really a "warning"; it's more an "important." Would be nice to have a warning class. Also would be nice to give that block quote thing more sane styles
[05:10:54] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i have to give it to them, those are pretty
[05:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it gives me very mixed feelings.
[05:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm excited to see this.
[05:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> But disappointed that it's datepicker-specific.
[05:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> I filed an issue :-)
[05:12:54] <kborchers> :)
[05:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: We can fix both. We have the power :-)
[05:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> So, first up, what should the warning style look like
[05:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> I like the yellow box.
[05:15:38] <kswedberg> cool cool. yeah, yellow box nice
[05:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, should I just take the styles straight from Mobile? Any changes?
[05:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think it looks fine as is.
[05:27:57] <agcolom> +1
[05:28:24] <agcolom> The color should work fine on all the project themes I think
[05:33:01] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, are you running the meeting today?
[05:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[05:33:45] <rxaviers> k
[05:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: re: keyCodes, Mobile has invalid values.
[05:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> I just told them to remove the TODO and update their codes to match UI.
[05:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/8dcb02d03598b75204227b5c187d8b6e8d33b03d
[05:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'd actually like to remove the NUMPAD values as well.
[05:39:42] <rxaviers> ah! I see
[05:40:30] <rxaviers> thanks for the feedback
[05:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> I added an item to today's agenda to discuss key codes.
[05:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> Removing NUMPAD_* and using event.which.
[05:42:43] <rxaviers> you are correct about event.which.. There's no apparent benefit using it currently.
[05:43:37] <rxaviers> but ok, thanks for bringing it to the meeting
[05:48:05] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez I was thinking. For the progressbar bug why don't we just explicitly declare .ui-progressbar-value { box-sizing: content-box; } http://jsfiddle.net/eyEzZ/.
[05:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping we can avoid getting into declaring box-sizing.
[05:50:34] <tj_vantoll> Ok, I'll dig into it. The accordion bug that just came in is valid as well.
[05:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom kswedberg: Updated both sites and deployed.
[05:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> You may need to refresh to get the stylesheet update.
[05:58:11] <kswedberg> awesome. thanks!
[06:09:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: you're a superstar! Thank you!!!! :-)
[06:13:26] <kborchers> agcolom: i think you meant ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
[06:13:28] <kborchers> üòâ
[06:16:00] <agcolom> kborchers: euh, ok, I think I need some training on special characters ;-)
[06:16:25] <kborchers> agcolom: are you on a mac?
[06:16:33] <agcolom> kborchers: yes
[06:16:35] <kborchers> command + option + t
[06:17:36] <agcolom> kborchers: where is option (I have an English keyboard ;-) ) which made scott_gonzalez laugh at the dev summit!
[06:18:10] <kborchers> hmmm, right next to command on mine ‚Ä¶ maybe alt
[06:18:25] <agcolom> command + alt + t
[06:18:28] <kborchers> yeah
[06:19:22] <agcolom> what am I supposed to see when you typed those characters? ( I just see boxes with 2B50 in them ) should I change the encoding?
[06:19:36] <kborchers> :D
[06:20:01] <kborchers> not sure how you do that but yeah, probably
[06:20:07] <agcolom> and the last one is 01F609 !
[06:20:31] <kborchers> agcolom: http://cl.ly/image/0f1G251S3q3U
[06:21:19] <agcolom> Oh that's fantastic! but not at all what I'm seeing! 
[06:21:31] <agcolom> I'll show you///
[06:25:02] <agcolom> kborchers: http://f.cl.ly/items/2U3G2T3u3M2b3Q1i2B0U/stars_in_code.tiff
[06:27:44] <kborchers> agcolom: hmmm, are you on lion?
[06:29:11] <agcolom> This mac is quite old. 10.6.8 so snow leopard?
[06:29:30] <kborchers> ah, i think that's your issue
[06:29:39] <agcolom> I'll try later on my mac book air, I think I've got lion on it.
[06:29:58] <kborchers> i think support starting in >= Lion
[06:30:17] <kborchers> well, now that we've tracked down that important issue, back to work ;)
[06:30:19] <agcolom> I had seen those weird characters once before and obviously didn't understand it! (I think it was on twitter)
[06:30:49] <agcolom> actually, I'm having a break in the sun... so back to my break in the sun ;-) 
[06:30:55] <kborchers> :P
[08:02:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: on the api docs, should I do git pull or git fetch followed by git rebase? (or something else)
[08:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: If you have local commits that haven't been pushed, use `git pull --rebase`
[08:21:38] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I have no commits local that haven't been pushed
[08:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> Then you can just `git pull`, though `git pull --rebase` won't do anything bad.
[08:24:03] <agcolom> ok, I did git pull --rebase 
[08:24:36] <agcolom> would it be safer if I did that all the time to avoid sometimes getting merges that I didn't expect?
[08:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:25:03] <agcolom> great. Will do
[08:25:19] <agcolom> btw those styles for date picker look quite nice I thought
[08:29:16] <agcolom> yes, I saw that. Would make a lot more sense to skin all the widgets on the page with the same theme I agree.
[08:30:50] <agcolom> Igore the "i saw that' I thought I saw an answer but it was your answer to someone else much earlier in the day!
[09:00:47] <agcolom> ignore ^ 
[12:19:20] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re the datepicker skins, there's a nice message at the bottom of the readme: Thank you to all the designers at 365psd for the free PSDs, and of course to jQuery, and jQuery UI.
[13:10:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: been crazy today ‚Ä¶ want to talk pointer stuff tomorrow? either side of lunch works for me (late morning or early afternoon)
[14:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Either works for me.
[15:13:18] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15steveluscher opened pull request #976: The active element will now blur when clicking on or dragging a draggable (4261). (06master...064261_blur_on_draggable_click)  02http://git.io/NmIMFg
[19:17:35] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, how about 2 EST tomorrow?
