[05:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Should the release automation be a grunt task or a standalone node script?
[05:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> I want to start rewriting https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/build/release/prepare-release
[05:54:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is that worth the effort? There's a lot of calls going on that need to be async in node, e.g. git commands, that will get pretty complex
[05:55:01] <scott_gonzalez> async isn't complex
[05:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> It would read just fine using Step.
[05:55:59] <jzaefferer> If we make it a grunt task, we need to start extracting tasks from grunt.js
[05:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely worth it. The stuff that's already there could easily be converted to node, and then I'd actually understand it.
[05:56:24] <jzaefferer> add a grunt.loadTasks(…) call
[05:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was planning on extracting some tasks anyway.
[05:56:50] <jzaefferer> okay, then grunt + extracting some
[05:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> I would definitely put this into a separate file.
[05:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to work on getting a single script for both minor and major releases.
[05:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> Try to automate even more and drop all the SVN stuff.

[07:26:24] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[07:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> jquicommit seems to be a bit slow
[07:31:42] <kborchers> i wonder if it's github because we have been having trouble with out commit bot at work too
[07:31:49] <kborchers> our*
[07:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> maybe
[07:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> You know what's fun?
[07:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> Fixing all the lint errors in tests. Especially the really old ones that we don't actually care about like draggable and droppable.
[07:33:45] <kborchers> LOL ... i figured you were going to say something about "Tests: Lint" :)
[07:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> The list is getting pretty small though :-)
[07:34:12] <kborchers> nice!
[07:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> Though this is upsetting: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/grunt.js#L348
[07:34:58] <kborchers> holy globals!
[07:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously.
[07:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need something like Test = {};
[07:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can attach all of our helpers to that.
[07:35:38] <kborchers> yeah
[07:35:55] <scott_gonzalez> Some of these, like accordion_state, are reasonable.
[07:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> Others, like d1, are not.
[07:36:22] <scott_gonzalez> At least the new stuff is prefixed :-P
[07:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Like menu_log.
[07:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe TestHelpers = {}; Then menu can do TestHelpers.menu = { ... }
[07:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> Then individual test files can just do: var log = TestHelpers.menu.log; inside a closure for the file.
[07:38:13] <kborchers> yeah, i think that would make sense
[07:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> When I finish this round of cleanup, I'll test that out with accordion.
[07:40:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: if you like how it ends up working, let me know and i can update menu
[07:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> That's my plan :-)
[08:12:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you could just set `undef: false` for tests
[08:13:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Our tests are supposed to conform to our coding standards.
[08:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> They should use the same options as our src lint.
[08:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> Only 2 errors now!
[08:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> JSHint yells at us for document.write() being a form of eval :-(
[08:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> Lint now includes tests :-)

[11:51:13] <jholloman> I'm receiving an error when trying to build jqueryui with grunt (first time using grunt)
[11:51:22] <jholloman> Loading "grunt.js" tasks and helpers...ERROR>> Error: Cannot find module 'request'<WARN> Task "default" not found. Use --force to continue. </WARN>
[11:51:57] <jholloman> any ideas what I might be doing wrong? I've installed grunt with npm using "npm install -g grunt" then cloned the jqueryui project and went to the base directory and ran "grunt"
[11:52:08] <kborchers> jholloman: npm install request
[11:52:41] <jholloman> ah, i tried grunt-request randomly :\ thanks
[11:54:24] <jholloman> thanks kborchers, that's as easy as I was hoping it would be. Off to install phantomjs now
[11:54:33] <kborchers> :)
[11:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> jholloman: Don't do `npm install request`
[11:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> Do `npm install` from the root of the jquery-ui checkout.
[11:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> package.json defines all of the dependencies.
[12:00:22] <jholloman> oh ok, thanks scott_gonzalez
[12:01:01] <jholloman> also new to npm
[12:04:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jholloman oh, sorry about that. i had assumed you tried that and it didn't work for some reason. i guess we know what happens when you assume :P
[12:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you make an ass out of kborchers :-P
[12:05:18] <kborchers> lol
[12:06:03] <jholloman> no problem kborchers, new to open source dev so to work on one thing i need 5 other tools that I'm unfamiliar with
[12:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> jholloman: It's our fault for not having the readme updated yet.
[12:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> The grunt build is very new.
[12:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> We're still working through some of the details, so we haven't updated the readme yet.
[12:07:43] <jholloman> yeah I noticed there was no step by step yet, and my google queries were bad enough that I mostly ended up with Halo results
[12:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> haha, that's awesome
[17:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> WHY? https://github.com/atrigent/jquery-ui/blob/4e3f25d06531a9ec637d9bce3af2fd308ac8fbfd/ui/jquery.ui.draggable.js#L232
[17:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> What's wrong with .remove()?
[18:23:06] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez how do we get ahold of hans for a11y testing? getting close on Menu i think
[18:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can @hanshillen on GitHub. He's occassionally in here too.
[18:24:16] <kborchers> ok, thanks
[18:27:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: OH, remember how we kept thinking the NVDA was saying "On the main level"?
[18:28:06] <kborchers> Unavailable!
[18:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> HAH!
[18:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to use "on the mail level" as unavailable now.
[18:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> new away message :-)
[18:29:03] <kborchers> definitely LOL
[18:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> Where's Dave? He's on the main level.
[18:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> "Sorry I can't answer the phone right now. I'm on the main level. Leave a message and I'll call you back!"
[18:30:07] <kborchers> heh
[18:30:30] <kborchers> sounds like you have multiple phone lines per level in your house ... rich bastard!
[18:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> HTTP 503 Service is on the main level!
[18:30:53] <kborchers> lol
[18:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ZOMG stopImmediatePropagation() all up in my face!
[18:50:41] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, that event is on the main level.
[18:51:06] <kborchers> lol
[18:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I can't look into that PR right now.
[18:51:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait till the menu updates land.
[18:52:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: what PR?
[18:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/288
[18:52:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess GitHub is still delayed on notifications...
[18:53:03] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (11m, 4d ago): Autocomplete: Added check to determine if menu has just been created to override unintended mouseover event and reset that variable when closed. Fixed #7024 - Autocomplete menu options are activated even if mouse is not moved
[18:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> see last two comments
[18:54:56] <kborchers> the updates did land ... but still a stopImmediateProp on mouseover

[18:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:56:22] <kborchers> not sure how to fix that one ... our method wasn't working. i think because mouseover fires all over the place and it just made a mess
[18:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, Hopefully I'll be working on menu soon.
[18:57:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping to finish up some widgets this month; we'll see how that goes.
[18:58:04] <scott_gonzalez> Supposedly Everett will finally get around to the last thing on autocomplete tomorrow.
[18:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can wrap that up.
[18:58:30] <kborchers> cool
[18:58:36] <kborchers> i will look at menu now and see if i just missed something last time i messed with it
[18:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on keyboard interaction for tabs.
[18:58:44] <kborchers> yeah, i saw that
[18:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda busted without the ARIA implemented, so I'll need to do that.
[18:59:20] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to finalize the position updates that jzaefferer has been working on.
[18:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> Did another review of that tonight.
[18:59:55] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully Hans will actually respond about tooltip ARIA.
[19:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a lot of plugins that are 90+% done.
[19:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Would like to finally wrap them up so I can focus.
[19:00:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm bouncing around way too much right now.
[19:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> I feel very distracted.
[19:00:46] <kborchers> i just pinged him via a commit comment in github so i'll try to pin him down if he responds ... he may be on the main level though
[19:00:51] <kborchers> :)
[19:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[19:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> What should I do with stuff like this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/399
