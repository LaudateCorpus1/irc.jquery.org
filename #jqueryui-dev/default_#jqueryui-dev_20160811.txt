[17:02:58] <sergiodj> hi there, I'm working towards updating the current jquery-ui package on Debian, and I have a few questions that you may be able to help with
[17:03:46] <sergiodj> basically, it is not enough to just download the .zip file from the website and package it.  Debian requires that the final "binary" (in this case, jquery-ui.js) be built from the original sources
[17:04:11] <sergiodj> however, we don't do grunt builds there.  so I'll have to figure out a way to build the tarball available from github without it.
[17:04:40] <sergiodj> has anyone made this before?  would you have an idea on how to tackle this problem?
[17:04:48] <sergiodj> TIA
