[09:04:29] <m_gol> anyone here? scott_gonzalez arschmitz jzaefferer
[09:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> hey m_gol 
[09:04:53] <m_gol> hi; have you seen my question? https://irc.jquery.org/%23jqueryui-dev/default_%23jqueryui-dev_20160810.log.html#t07:02:21
[09:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> I had not. I was on vacation.
[09:06:11] <m_gol> I see. Are you back now or should I not bother you at the moment?
[09:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm back now.
[09:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> We probably want to keep testing every minor.
[09:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> We've dropped all the patch releases other than the latest for each minor though.
[09:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> At least for TestSwarm.
[09:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> We just recently switched our policy to only support the latest patch versions for every minor version we support.
[09:08:05] <m_gol> I see. Do you want to have Core 3.0 & 3.1 etc. tests in separate jobs then?
[09:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:08:25] <m_gol> ok, I'll create the 3.1 one then
[09:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:14:59] <m_gol> done: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3490
