[03:33:57] <agcolom> Hi Japser :-)
[03:33:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: about the empty toolbars

[03:34:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that is the fix ^^^
[03:34:21] <agcolom> oh, great! Thanks :-)
[03:34:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but it only works if there is no whitespace or line break
[03:34:38] <agcolom> so that will be in 1.4?
[03:35:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: would that be a problem for the docs?
[03:35:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I pushed to a branch now, I think we can merge for 1.4
[03:35:41] <agcolom> No, it's just that I'd like to remove my <h4> </h4> in the examples. but there aren't that many
[03:36:02] <agcolom> just so I know when to remove those empty headings :-)
[03:36:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, just make sure the code looks like this <div data-role="footer"></div>
[03:36:17] <uGoMobi> no new line
[03:36:28] <agcolom> oh, no new line... ok
[03:36:58] <agcolom> what does a new line add? (content to the footer?)
[03:37:03] <uGoMobi> because I used :empty and spaces and new lines are considered as content
[03:37:11] <agcolom> right. 
[03:37:19] <uGoMobi> yes, the selector won't match
[03:37:43] <agcolom> and when is 1.4 going out again roughly?
[03:37:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will let you know when we have merged the branch
[03:38:01] <agcolom> great, thanks
[03:38:07] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I hope we can release final in a month
[03:38:44] <agcolom> ok, great. it's also so I know what version to use in October when I'm teaching...
[03:38:58] <agcolom> (will have to update all my slides ;-) )
[03:39:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: 1.4 for sure
[03:39:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that might take some time
[03:39:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we will add upgrade guide to help you ;)
[03:39:32] <agcolom> yes, I'm only given 30 min for a 2h lecture! It's a joke!
[03:39:39] <uGoMobi> :/
[03:40:14] <agcolom> yes, and just found out that I may lose my job in 2014 because I don't have any recent research publications
[03:40:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: also, I am comming to Austin
[03:40:33] <agcolom> oh, fantastic!
[03:40:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: wot... that sounds bad!
[03:41:18] <agcolom> yes... not good! I'm hoping the external work I do for jQuery will be seen as a good thing, but it may not count... 
[03:42:17] <agcolom> but I think it still makes me more employable and is a lot more fun, so I prefer to stick to that rather than try to publish research papers...
[03:42:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what if we do some performance research ... could you use that?
[03:42:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Yes that would be goof
[03:42:44] <agcolom> good! ^
[03:42:54] <agcolom> really good actually...
[03:43:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: some guys on the university of technology in the Netherlands started to look into that
[03:43:39] <uGoMobi> not saying you should copy
[03:43:46] <agcolom> ;-)
[03:43:53] <uGoMobi> but we could use that as base
[03:44:02] <agcolom> yes, that could be interesting...
[03:44:08] <uGoMobi> we want to have better insight in performance
[03:44:40] <uGoMobi> I think core is looking into performance testing too
[03:45:31] <agcolom> interesting...
[03:45:38] <uGoMobi> agcolom: like I just said, I will be in Austin... we can work on new web site and API docs things there
[03:45:49] <uGoMobi> but could also look into this
[03:45:51] <agcolom> yes, that will be really good...
[03:46:02] <agcolom> I'm working on my slides for the talk also...

[03:50:44] <uGoMobi> grr looks like images are lost in the mail that I forwarded
[03:54:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what I forwarded to you gives you an impression of the research those students are doing.

[06:06:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[06:17:46] <_|Nix|_> Heya folks!
[06:23:45] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[06:29:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! We still don't have a non-inset look for the filterable textinput.
[06:29:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait! I could be wrong ... hold on.
[06:29:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a inset and non-inset style
[06:30:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think I'm wrong.
[06:30:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just decided to get rid of the bar background
[06:30:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, hold on ... I'm an idiot ...
[06:31:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You're right. There /is/ a non-inset look now.
[06:31:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry ...
[06:31:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm re-working the filterable demo page ...
[06:31:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we used to place the non-inset filter input in a bar, but that would only look nice with listview and collapsible
[06:32:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[06:32:11] <uGoMobi> and it required an additional wrapper to set bar theme
[06:32:25] <uGoMobi> so I thought... let's just restyle it
[06:32:41] <uGoMobi> if you want a bar, you can create the input yourself and place inside a bar
[06:32:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[06:33:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's another theme for 1.4.0: "Write your own damn markup!" :)
[06:33:27] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:33:57] <uGoMobi> the jQuery Mobile do-it-self kit
[06:37:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you know how come on http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/filterable/ in the table filter example the table looks as if the window was really narrow?
[06:37:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How come the columns there are not side-by-side?
[06:38:43] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:40:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: does it work when you add data-mode="reflow" ?
[06:40:46] <uGoMobi> I suppose it should work without that since it's the default
[06:41:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[06:41:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope. Doesn't help.
[06:42:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this one works http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/examples/tables/movie-list.php
[06:42:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I don't understand why the one in the filterable widget demo doesn't work.
[06:43:03] <uGoMobi> It can't be the padding on the content
[07:08:27] <gseguin> Good morning
[07:09:07] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: how do you guys deploy UI to the new CDN ?
[07:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> We don't.
[07:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> The new CDN has been around for less than a week.
[07:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> But it will just be git add, git commit, git push from a script.
[07:10:22] <gseguin> yeah yeah I know I was just wondering if you had written a Grunt script to deploy
[07:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> We don't use grunt for releases.
[07:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> We just use a node script.
[07:11:00] <gseguin> either way, you're scripting it
[07:11:04] <gseguin> or going to
[07:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[07:11:53] <gseguin> So the only issue I see is the location of the CDN repo which could be diferrent from one machine to the other
[07:12:07] <gseguin> how do you plan to handle that?
[07:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> The release script is fully isolated.
[07:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> It will clone the CDN repo.
[07:12:40] <gseguin> oh ok, it'll clone the repo in a temp dir
[07:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> The script is intentionally written to not use anything that already exists on your computer.
[07:12:44] <gseguin> and then remove it
[07:13:55] <gseguin> ok, that works for me except the cloning might take a while
[07:42:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I assign you to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6225 and set the milestone to 1.4.0?
[07:42:11] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6225 by RedWolves (2d 12h ago): Filter: Filtering a SELECT element causes unexpected experience
[07:42:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes 
[07:43:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Awesome!
[07:44:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6226 - should I implement a preventDefault for the submit event of the generated form in the filterable backcompat?
[07:44:47] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6226 by RedWolves (2d 12h ago): Filter: hitting return in the filter box reloads the page
[07:45:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IINM, placing the input into the DOM without a form may result in its becoming a part of another form - if the children are inside a form.
[07:45:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, if we do place it inside a form, we're gonna end up with nested forms.
[07:46:19] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:48:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I think we have to prevent that
[07:48:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why isn't this an issue with old filter?
[07:48:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, I'm checking on that right now.
[07:49:13] <_|Nix|_> ... because it isn't. At least not on the listviews demo page of 1.3-stable.
[07:51:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, .submit( function( e ) { e.preventDefault(); search.blur(); } );
[07:51:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what made it work.
[07:52:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll copy that over to the filterable backcompat.
[07:52:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: blur() ? didn't we do something to set focus on first item in the list?
[07:53:11] <lduros> hi, is there a way to override a function such as _change: function ( event ) {} in autocomplete.js from user code? I'm trying to remove the if ( this.previous !== this._value() ) conditional statement, but I'd like not to modify the jqueryui code
[07:56:03] <lduros> would overriding like this work: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2751800
[07:56:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... that's what there was. preventDefault and blur.
[07:56:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I remember gseguin worked on that long time ago
[07:56:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and indeed, when you hit enter in 1.3-stable, it does not submit the form, but the textinput does get blurred.
[07:57:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[07:57:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can git blame the .blur() and maybe see why it was added.
[07:57:15] <uGoMobi> let's not change behaviour
[07:57:19] <uGoMobi> and just use that
[07:57:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[07:57:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: +1
[07:57:36] <gseguin> what did I do? 
[07:58:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: (Maybe) Add a .blur() to the submit handler for the form surrounding the textinput generated by the listview filter extension.
[07:58:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Wow! That was a mouthful :)
[07:58:27] <gseguin> Was that good or bad?
[07:58:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: We dunno why it's been added.
[07:58:43] <gseguin> I'll claim responsibility (or not) after you answer
[07:58:48] <gseguin> :)
[07:58:55] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I don't think it matters much.
[07:59:27] <_|Nix|_> Although, if the user hits enter, she may want to filter again without having to click on the input again *shrug* ... but whatever.
[07:59:31] <gseguin> I don't remember why I did that
[07:59:39] <gseguin> isn't it in the commit message
[07:59:40] <gseguin> ?
[07:59:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Maybe to make the virtual keyboard go away.
[07:59:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm about to git blame that line to find the commit.
[08:00:50] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: "Blur the search field on submit -- Fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3303"
[08:00:50] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #3303 by lijumathews (19mon 1w ago): Iphone : Go button does not close the keyboard with Data filter
[08:01:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Bam!
[08:01:10] <gseguin> So I guess it was on purpose
[08:01:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ya dun good, son!
[08:01:24] <gseguin> oh yeah I remember now
[08:01:27] <uGoMobi> yeah that was what I meant
[08:01:41] <gseguin> it's how you make the keyboard disappear
[08:02:04] <_|Nix|_> Indeed. And now I shall bring that forth unto the backcompat.
[08:02:08] <uGoMobi> I thought we also talked about setting focus on first item
[08:02:17] <uGoMobi> so you can nav with arrow keys
[08:02:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's not happening in 1.3.x.
[08:02:27] <uGoMobi> looks like we didn't add that
[08:02:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The focus-on-first-item thing.
[08:02:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nope.

[08:10:11] <_|Nix|_> OK. I uncovered a navigation regression.
[08:10:32] <_|Nix|_> We submit forms via changePage even if the submit event default has already been prevented.
[08:13:48] <_|Nix|_> Fixed now.
[08:14:06] <_|Nix|_> I'll write a unit test.
[08:14:22] <_|Nix|_> Or, rather, an integration test.
[08:15:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's a bit of an issue ... currently filterable backcompat syncs the options of the widget with the options of the textinput. So, any options that textinput has that the widget also has will have their value forwarded from the widget to the textinput upon _create and upon _setOptions.
[08:16:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, most widgets will have corners = false when inset = false.
[08:16:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the focus and keyboard nav stuff was something i wrote for the demos
[08:16:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the value corners: false gets forwarded to the textinput when inset is turned off.
[08:16:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So you end up with a squary-looking textinput on top of a non-inset listview.
[08:17:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: check out the search at top of demo pages
[08:17:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: which is now unreadable with new theme when using keyboard lol

[08:30:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so first thing i know we have been terrible about this in the past but we need to follow http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#naming-conventions
[08:30:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so what we would need is a piece of code that prevents setting the option corners of textinput to false if it is because of inset is false
[08:30:19] <arschmitz> so all varible names should be full words
[08:31:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yuck!
[08:31:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: True.
[08:32:08] <uGoMobi> yeah very yuck
[08:32:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can do a pass over the whole library at some point.
[08:32:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess if people are bothered by it, they can always ditch the backcompat and put their own textinput there.
[08:32:46] <arschmitz> and kinda like with filterable dont use opt or elem just use this.options this.element
[08:33:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, TBH I did measure a difference in the min.js ...
[08:33:19] <arschmitz> but thats not gzipped
[08:33:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, another thing to do in one pass.
[08:35:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: as you already said.. that we set corners to false when inset is false is actually something we should handle with CSS
[08:36:32] <uGoMobi> but that will change soon we remove all of that from the JS
[08:36:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also you use $tgt no hungarian notation
[08:37:06] <uGoMobi> will think about a temporary solution for 1.4
[08:39:17] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6227: Filter: Multiple Select Elements (Filter Selectors) demo doesn't work  02http://git.io/LSSV4A
[08:39:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[08:39:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you have init selector in options and i see 2 todos about moving code into widget at bottom if your doing cleanup wouldnt this be a good time for that?
[08:40:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then you can use delay for the timeout also 
[08:40:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't really think that code should be moved into the widget.
[08:40:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man! I've overlooked so much! Thanks!
[08:40:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why dont you think it should be moved?
[08:41:22] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6231: Filter: data-target does not work  02http://git.io/grCgsQ
[08:41:42] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6229: Filter: data-wrapper-class &/or wrapperClass has no effect  02http://git.io/Z3crPQ
[08:41:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because it intercepts pagebeforechange.
[08:41:51] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #6230: Filter: data-mini does not reduce the size of the filter box  02http://git.io/HhHHEQ
[08:42:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Should also be using .on() instead of bind().
[08:43:05] <arschmitz> ok wouldnt this be a case to use on not _on but be in widget?
[08:43:24] <arschmitz> such as is mentioned by scott here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[08:43:37] <arschmitz> #7
[08:44:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but this binding is not for any particular widget.
[08:44:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The handler decides which popup to open.
[08:44:42] <arschmitz> hmmm yeah 
[08:44:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In this sense the popup is like a page.
[08:45:04] <arschmitz> makes me think once again that we need a better hook into nav for widgets
[08:45:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[08:45:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking to split up popup into a bunch of extensions for 1.5.0.
[08:45:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nav would be one.
[08:45:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Link binding would be another.
[08:45:42] <arschmitz> this is something that should not even really be handled by the widgets directly
[08:45:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly. That's why it's outside the widget.
[08:46:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In a way it's exactly like enhanceWithin.
[08:46:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You go over each popup widget and decide whether it's the one you need to open.
[08:47:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The good news is you have the href to guide you, so it's not as blind as enhanceWithin.
[08:47:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, enhanceWithin has the initSelector for a guide.
[08:48:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After 1.4.0, I think I will move this inside the widget - in the sense that I'll move it into one of the extensions.
[08:48:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i need to put some thought into how to handle this in a more general sense
[08:48:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: before you put too much more work into popup i think we should look into ui dialog
[08:48:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One good way would be to make the click handler accept plugins.
[08:49:03] <arschmitz> because long run there will be only one
[08:49:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think for now I'll just make the systematic changes, like the name changes and stuff like that you mentioned earlier.
[08:49:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need that for 1.4.0.
[08:49:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i meant bigger 1.5 things like extensions and stuff
[08:50:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[08:50:36] <agcolom> Hi, has anyone had a git push going into a blackhole?
[08:50:51] <arschmitz> agcolom: what do you mean?
[08:50:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: How do you mean? It completed successfully, but the commits didn't show up on github?
[08:51:06] <agcolom> details on #jquery-content
[08:51:18] <agcolom> commit didn't show up anywhere!
[08:51:34] <agcolom> except on my machine!
[08:51:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Weird.
[08:51:57] <agcolom> so not on github, not in email, not on irc, 
[08:52:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: when did you make the most recent commit
[08:52:09] <agcolom> the issue it was supposed to fix is not closed
[08:52:14] <arschmitz> more recently then 6 hours ago?
[08:52:17] <agcolom> a few minustes ago
[08:52:25] <agcolom> minutes ^
[08:53:08] <agcolom> but on my computer it saidL

[08:53:58] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sounds like it was successful.
[08:53:59] <arschmitz> yeah weird maybe github is having issues
[08:54:08] <agcolom> their status is fine
[08:54:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have to go now, but I'll probably be back in, like, 6-7 hours, make those changes, and merge.
[08:54:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks for going over it!
[08:55:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thanks im still looking ill let you know if i notice anything else
[08:55:04] <agcolom> but the weird thing is that the change is not showing up on stage
[08:55:15] <agcolom> it should be there
[08:55:21] <arschmitz> agcolom: it wouldnt if git hub never got the push
[08:55:27] <arschmitz> or isnt sending out hooks
[08:55:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just address me in the chan and I'll backscroll.
[08:55:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks!
[08:55:48] <agcolom> arschmitz: really?
[08:55:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no problem
[08:56:11] <agcolom> later _|Nix|_ :-)
[08:56:38] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah you push to git hub then its either on a cron or post commit hook to update stage
[08:56:45] <arschmitz> i forget which with the sites
[08:57:12] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#595 (master - 03b0dcc : Ghislain Seguin): The build was fixed.

[08:57:12] <agcolom> I thought it was indenpendent... 
[08:58:39] <arschmitz> agcolom: i dont think so basicly everything uses github as the root source
[08:59:20] <arschmitz> agcolom: try pushing again
[08:59:32] <arschmitz> it will either say up to date or accept it
[08:59:51] <agcolom> just a git push?
[08:59:55] <arschmitz> yup
[08:59:56] <agcolom> (no commit)
[09:00:05] <arschmitz> yeah you have the commit on your machine already
[09:00:19] <agcolom> Everything up-to-date
[09:01:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: try this git log -1
[09:01:29] <arschmitz> and see if it lists your most recent commit message
[09:01:44] <agcolom> commit f7748cefd54804d010b36ba005806f00b689aa00
[09:01:44] <agcolom> Author: Anne-Gaelle Colom <coloma@wmin.ac.uk>
[09:01:44] <agcolom> Date:   Wed Jul 31 16:26:12 2013 +0100
[09:01:46] <agcolom>     changed popupbefore position event parameters to event, ui. Fixes #138
[09:02:00] <arschmitz> thats what your trying to push right?
[09:02:13] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: more info for you here ^ 
[09:03:18] <arschmitz> agcolom: if thats the commit your trying to push then this is an issue with github
[09:03:39] <agcolom> yes, I'm guessing that is the only explanation!
[09:03:42] <arschmitz> they have received your push and their actual git repo is updated
[09:04:32] <arschmitz> however the ui is not updated and there for the post recieve hooks are not being activated which is also why there was no notification on irc thats a post commit hook also
[09:09:12] <agcolom> so do we just wait?
[09:09:37] <arschmitz> yeah not much else you can do
[09:10:10] <agcolom> but Richard's commit just went and other comments as well...
[09:11:02] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah probably just a one off glitch or its fixed
[09:11:12] <agcolom> so github just decided to not like me today then ;-)
[09:11:21] <arschmitz> but you will probably not see anychange until you push another commit to that same repo
[09:11:31] <arschmitz> have any really minor changes to make in there?
[09:11:34] <agcolom> ok, I'll try that
[09:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I can confirm that the push made it.
[09:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> When I did a pull I got the commit.
[09:14:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thanks!
[09:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> So it's definitely just a glitch in the UI.
[09:14:27] <agcolom> I just pushed another one... and it worked...
[09:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> oh, good
[09:15:23] <agcolom> so this one is on github, but not the previous one
[09:15:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: they both show now
[09:15:41] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commits/master
[09:15:54] <arschmitz> and both should pull to stage now
[09:16:23] <agcolom> strange, it's not in my "public activity" https://github.com/agcolom?tab=activity
[09:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> I think all of the GitHub stuff just died on that commit.
[09:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> No notifications, no stream updates, nothing...
[09:17:20] <agcolom> yes, it's on stage!
[09:17:38] <agcolom> that was scary!
[09:19:13] <agcolom> thank arschmitz and scott_gonzalez ! (again ;-) )
[09:19:21] <agcolom> thanks ^

[09:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you have some time this week to look at Polymer integration with kborchers and me?
[09:43:38] <DaveMethvin> sure scott_gonzalez ... when's good for you guys
[09:45:21] <kborchers> i could do almost any time tomorrow
[09:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> Tomorrow any time is good for me.
[09:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> Only thing on my calendar is testing and content meetings. You know *those* things don't happen :-P
[09:46:41] <DaveMethvin> i have something at noon but otherwise free
[09:46:52] <DaveMethvin> also this afternoon even
[09:47:10] <kborchers> i can't do this afternoon
[09:47:23] <DaveMethvin> tomorrow looks good ten
[09:47:24] <DaveMethvin> then
[09:47:39] <DaveMethvin> how bout 1pm?
[09:47:39] <kborchers> tomorrow afternoon? 2EST?
[09:47:47] <DaveMethvin> 2 is fine 
[09:48:08] <kborchers> i could do 1 if scott_gonzalez doesn't have content meeting :)
[09:48:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[09:48:15] <DaveMethvin> and it's kind of mobile dev :)
[09:49:14] <kborchers> oh yeah, 2 is mobile … 1 might be better if scott_gonzalez can do it … i could probably do AM too
[09:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> 1p ET works for me.
[09:49:31] <kborchers> cool
[09:49:35] <DaveMethvin> okay, 1pm it is
[09:49:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[09:50:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have a failing test on autoinit im hoping you might have some insight on
[09:50:24] <arschmitz> ast li non-inset list has no border bottom
[09:50:32] <arschmitz> *last
[09:50:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its my last failing test i think !
[09:51:08] <DaveMethvin> whoa that was awesome, the meeting appeared on my calendar in realtime
[09:54:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: any thoughts on potential causes of that?
[09:55:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i am looking
[09:57:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't understand why that should be any different in your branch
[09:57:24] <arschmitz> neither do i lol
[10:01:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i got it 
[10:01:08] <arschmitz> enhancement race condition
[10:01:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: everything from master is in auto init branch, right?
[10:01:14] <uGoMobi> aha
[10:01:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[10:01:26] <arschmitz> but the autoinit branch on github is out of date
[10:01:28] <uGoMobi> but that can be a real issue then?
[10:01:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes it was a real issue
[10:01:41] <uGoMobi> or race condition in test
[10:02:14] <arschmitz> well real issue in tests it was AMD issue 
[10:02:22] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:03:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i actually started over completely it was easier then rebasing master into autoinit lol
[10:03:50] <uGoMobi> yeah can imagine
[10:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is it just me or is the scrolling with a trackpad/mousewheel busted on this grid? http://paramquery.com/demos/group
[10:12:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: works for me
[10:12:49] <tj_vantoll> Really jerky and messed up for me.
[10:12:51] <arschmitz> oh never mind
[10:13:05] <arschmitz> it worked fine until i did something else then scrolling down no longer works
[10:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[10:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> It uses the widget factory and supports ThemeRoller.
[10:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> Claims to be super fast.
[10:13:54] <arschmitz> cool
[10:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> ah, http://paramquery.com/demos
[10:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's very UI-looking :-P
[10:14:40] <arschmitz> scrolling is bad for sure though think i just got lucky because every time sense even after refresh is very bad
[10:22:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: WOOO all green on autoinit
[10:26:13] <tj_vantoll> The scroll bar is a series of images o_O http://paramquery.com/Content/css/images/sprite.png
[10:27:57] <DaveMethvin> tj_vantoll but at least they made a sprite sheet, so it's an efficiently bad idea
[10:29:24] <tj_vantoll> DaveMethvin: And I have to say, they did an excellent job making it look like a real scroll bar. So an efficient AND good looking bad idea.
[11:03:39] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: re: http://paramquery.com/demos the horizontal scrolling is causing some pb with the position of the banner... see http://f.cl.ly/items/3e3Q1c0e2Q0A0o2V3g2d/Untitled.tiff
[11:07:26] <agcolom> even worse: http://f.cl.ly/items/3N1T2o1744053Q2M1Z1O/badalign.tiff

[12:37:15] <agcolom> oh, thanks
[12:38:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Do you want me to get started with the changelogs?
[12:46:27] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: but on ui, you seem to only have changelogs for stable releases (so no RC or beta): https://jqueryui.com/changelog/ 
[12:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like we don't have them for recent pre-releases.
[12:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> I think we started getting lazy.
[12:48:01] <agcolom> oh, I see ;-)
[12:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> You'll see them for the 1.8 pre-releases.
[12:48:54] <agcolom> oh, yes! I was looking for 1.10RC1...
[12:49:16] <agcolom> didn't look after 1.8 :-)

[12:55:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sorry, last question: should we have all the changelogs on the new site? (from 1.0alpha...?)
[12:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: If they didn't exist before, you don't have to generate them now.
[12:55:50] <agcolom> oh, yes, I'm not that mad ;-) 
[12:56:10] <agcolom> but I'm not sure where the 1.4 alpha changelog is....
[12:56:35] <agcolom> I've found a wiki, but i don't think it's the right thing...
[12:57:28] <agcolom> so I might do an old one to get started... I'm quite tired so I'm just after something where I can just do something where I don't have to think too much ;-)
[12:57:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[12:57:42] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[12:58:07] <agcolom> Is the changelog for 1.4 alpha ready?
[12:58:29] <agcolom> (can I try to make it on the new site)
[12:58:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the changelog is that wiki page / the blog post
[12:58:47] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog ?
[12:58:57] <uGoMobi> we probably missed some things

[13:57:07] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so from the front page: http://stage.jquerymobile.com/
[13:57:21] <agcolom> under developer links...
[13:58:02] <agcolom> previous releases... and changelogs are linked up
[13:58:06] <arschmitz> agcolom: looking good
[13:58:17] <agcolom> arschmitz: thank you :-)
[13:58:25] <arschmitz> cant wait to have that live
[13:58:44] <agcolom> yes, it's coming along nicely :-)
[13:59:34] <agcolom> btw I might need some refs from you guys at some point in the next year... Looks like we're going to have another restructuring phase...
[13:59:53] <arschmitz> im happy to help any way i can
[14:00:07] <agcolom> arschmitz: thank you :-)
[14:02:03] <agcolom> arschmitz: on the front page, the download box...
[14:02:21] <agcolom> stable should be 1.3.2 right?
[14:02:43] <agcolom>  and should legacy be 1.2.1?
[14:06:45] <arschmitz> yes
[14:07:42] <agcolom> thank you :-) changing now...
[14:08:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: looks great
[14:09:13] <agcolom> uGoMobi: thanks :-) being on holiday helps :-)
[14:09:30] <agcolom> (well I mean being on holiday at home... ) 
[14:09:41] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[14:09:51] <uGoMobi> was looking at our proposition
[14:10:13] <uGoMobi> think we dscribe JQM a bit different in the demo center
[14:10:22] <agcolom> yes?
[14:10:48] <uGoMobi> maybe we should remove for Smartphones & Tablets from the heading
[14:11:15] <uGoMobi> because many people know it's for desktop/RWD too
[14:11:26] <uGoMobi> don't know*
[14:11:38] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15arschmitz opened pull request #1040: Widget Factory: Fix multiple var statements in test (06master...06fixtest)  02http://git.io/PLxbNA
[14:12:24] <agcolom> yes... 
[14:13:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: really the direction we are heading is more about navigation then anything else too with moving widgets to ui
[14:13:36] <agcolom> so it is optimized for touch devices.... 
[14:13:39] <arschmitz> thought thats long term maybe it should specificly mention navigation
[14:14:02] <agcolom> I find smartphone a bit dated...
[14:14:21] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think it should say smartphones and tablets either
[14:14:39] <agcolom> but it's too late for my brain to come up with the best solution ;-)
[14:14:50] <agcolom> can we think about it tomorrow?
[14:15:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: im sure thats fine its not even live site yet
[14:15:14] <agcolom> or would you just say "A Touch-Optimized Web Framework"
[14:15:22] <uGoMobi> yeah, no rush
[14:15:31] <uGoMobi> but good to use same text everywhere
[14:15:40] <uGoMobi> also if someone talks on conf
[14:16:19] <agcolom> well I can change that because I need to push a change on that page anyway
[14:16:46] <uGoMobi> A Touch-Optimized Web Framework" sounds good for now
[14:17:27] <uGoMobi> we can change that picture with devices to show it's also for desktop
[14:19:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does the new flip switch work for you in our JS Bin template https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6257 ?
[14:19:06] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6257 by Max-Might (12h 21m ago): The official CDN does not have a working flipswitch control.
[14:19:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope
[14:19:43] <uGoMobi> interesting
[14:19:48] <uGoMobi> in Europe it works
[14:20:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: only ~1/7th of world is seeing new cdn right nopw
[14:20:13] <five> What is it you guys are discussin?
[14:20:17] <five> +g
[14:21:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the TTL on cdn was like a week so it will take upto a week before whole world sees it

[14:21:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[14:21:43] <uGoMobi> is that a DNS thing?
[14:21:59] <arschmitz> yes
[14:22:19] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:22:50] <agcolom> goodnight :-)
[14:22:52] <uGoMobi> five: you wanted to ask something about the CDN?
[14:23:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good night!
[14:23:13] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[14:23:14] <uGoMobi> don't dream about the new web site ;)
[14:23:51] <agcolom> at least tonight I'm not going to bed with an unresolved mega issue like I did yesterday ;-)
[14:24:04] <five> No, I see you guys talking about mobile / touch stuff.
[14:24:10] <five> Just curious as to what's cooking? :-)
[14:24:13] <arschmitz> agcolom: are zips really that important
[14:24:22] <arschmitz> five: well this is the dev channel for jquery mobile
[14:24:29] <RWhitbeck> agcolom did you solve that issue?
[14:24:29] <arschmitz> so that happens a lot
[14:24:34] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, 
[14:24:36] <five> I thought it was jqueryui?
[14:24:36] <arschmitz> lol
[14:24:39] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: yes we did
[14:24:41] <arschmitz> its both
[14:24:45] <five> Ah, I see.
[14:24:50] <RWhitbeck> awesome
[14:24:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ... and jQuery UI ;)
[14:25:10] * uGoMobi types slow
[14:25:23] <five> I wrote a jQuery UI extension so I'm hoping to hang out and learn what it takes to get it included in the main release.
[14:25:25] <agcolom> you will have to change something in MAMP... scott_gonzalez documented it... let me find that for you... 
[14:25:30] <RWhitbeck> five #jqueryuimobile-dev channel name was already taken ;-)
[14:25:34] <five> I can see that it needs much better unit tests for a start ;-)
[14:25:41] <five> RWhitbeck: hah!
[14:26:24] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/77d44365dd8f0ad4fa3f5b7edc03120547709603
[14:26:25] <b-ot> agcolom: Scott González (7h 5m ago): README: Increase memory limit for virtual host.
[14:26:36] <RWhitbeck> agcolom let me ask this question why are we storing zips in git anyways?
[14:26:57] <agcolom> we're storing them on the new site
[14:27:29] <agcolom> they don't belong to the cdn...
[14:28:23] <agcolom> (does that answer your question? ) if it doesn't then I don't know ;-)
[14:29:48] <agcolom> this time I am off :-) lots of good work done today :-) I'm happy :-)
[14:29:56] <RWhitbeck> good night.
