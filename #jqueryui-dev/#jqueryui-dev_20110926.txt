[10:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> wat? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7738
[10:32:01] <gnarf> heh
[10:32:06] <kborchers> wow
[10:33:42] <kborchers> wontfix - depends on $.unicorn which is not yet available
[10:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> after we land .box(), we should add .page() which you can call on the body and have it do it's magic
[10:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> it'll just create all the content for you (and of course call .box() on the generated elements)
[10:35:18] <kborchers> lol, definitely.
[10:36:17] <kborchers> I would have added one more line to your comment - "Please be sure your skin is thick enough for the responses you will get to this suggested widget."
