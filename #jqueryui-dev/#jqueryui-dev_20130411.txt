[10:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> I find this funny as a tweet, but sad as a reddit post: http://twitter.com/InfoSysReddit/status/322375674855817217
[10:27:27] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @InfoSysReddit: Really, jQueryUI? Your community example for Autocomplete Widget uses birds and not one European of African Swa... http://t.co/sECHUxYhpZ
[10:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I *think* this button issue is easy to fix.
[10:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to write a test to make sure I can reproduce this programmatically.
[10:41:56] <tj_vantoll> How?
[10:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> We should remove ui-state-focus on disable.
[10:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> oh, hmm...
[10:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> Can't use _focusable() here.
[10:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> The element that gets the focus event and the element that gets the class can be different.
[10:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[10:59:28] <tj_vantoll> Well, but natively all browser still consider the element focused until you tab / click away.
[11:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I don't really want to hack around this by listening for a focus event on the document.
[11:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> And this is the behavior we have on all other widgets.
[11:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> If you become disabled, focusable and hoverable classes get removed.
[11:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> You really shouldn't have a focused disabled element.
[11:02:34] <tj_vantoll> Yeah.  We could manually do it in setOption.
[11:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure people end up in this situation with disabled submit buttons after click.
[11:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> But having the state change in that case is probably fine.

[11:36:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez you have a sec to offer persepctive in #jquery-meeting?
[11:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Sorry, I was AFK.
[13:30:51] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: working on the classes stuff
[13:30:53] <petersendidit> "ui-tabs-nav": "ui-helper-reset ui-helper-clearfix ui-widget-header ui-corner-all",
[13:31:01] <petersendidit> should the helpers stay or get pulled out?
[13:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> stay
[13:32:22] <scott_gonzalez> Because they'll break without them.
[13:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> This is why I wish we could do mixins though.
[13:32:45] <petersendidit> ok so they should not be optional
[13:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> right
[13:45:48] <petersendidit> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/790 should be updated now
