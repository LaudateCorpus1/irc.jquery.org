[07:45:39] <gnarf> jzaefferer: is the 30 minute timeout global? or can we change that per build

[09:40:46] <jzaefferer> gnarf: why bother we really long timeouts, when we could just go back to running one job at a time?
[09:51:09] <Krinkle> (assuming this is about jenkins) that would also be healthier for TestSwarm in its current form, since newer jobs get preference. So the previous job would more more likely to time out.
[09:56:40] <jzaefferer> Krinkle gnarf: yeah, it is about Jenkins, where we used to have a job limit of one due to memory issues. As most jobs integrate with BrowserStack, going back to one seems very reasonable
[09:56:57] <Krinkle> yep
[09:57:09] <Krinkle> both TestSwarm as well as BrowserStack should get one at a time.
[09:57:46] <Krinkle> After my testswarm-browserstack is stable (almost done, will finish tomorrow I expect) it could handle scaling and continuous running better. But even then it is probably best to pop one at a time
[10:00:10] <jzaefferer> okay, I've set the number of executors (parallel jobs in Jenkins speech) back to 1, and quite time to 0, that way it won't wait before running the next job
