[02:09:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[02:13:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[02:13:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[02:14:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Jetlag worn off yet?
[02:14:07] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_, good morning
[02:14:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, almost I think
[02:14:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good, because I have a question about the loader.
[02:14:52] <uGoMobi> sure
[02:15:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5931, and I was wondering if it'd be worth deprecating $.mobile.loading(), which is the last remaining loader-related global function that was not deprecated in 1.3.
[02:15:25] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5931 by uGoMobi (4mon 3w ago): Loader: remove deprecated code from widget and update docs
[02:16:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking that we should move it to $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer( "loader" ), which returns the loader, and then you can call $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer( "loader" ).loader( "show" ), for example.
[02:16:40] <_|Nix|_> Sure, it's more code, but now the loader is fully contained inside the page container, and we can further separate it out by making it an extension of the pagecontainer.
[02:16:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure about that
[02:17:01] <_|Nix|_> So, the default page container shows no loading message at all, but the extension adds that capability.
[02:17:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what if you use tabs and want to show a loader while loading content
[02:17:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine.
[02:17:22] <uGoMobi> it's a loader widget, not page loading widget
[02:17:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You should always contact your nearest page container for that.
[02:17:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, you can go off on your own, instantiating your own loader widget.
[02:18:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not suggesting we get rid of the loader widget.
[02:18:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm just saying that, if you want to use the same loader widget as the page container, then you need to ask the page container to give you the loader widget so you can play with it.
[02:19:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean by "the same loader widget as the page container"?
[02:19:46] <uGoMobi> the widget that is already created
[02:19:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[02:20:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The page container creates a loader widget so it can show it while it retrieves content.
[02:20:27] <uGoMobi> right
[02:20:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the page container should have a public API for retrieving that loader widget in case somebody else wants to use it.
[02:20:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, it would be nice if you can hide/show that one
[02:21:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[02:21:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Another improvement would be to separate the show/hide loader logic from the pagecontainer into a pagecontainer extension.
[02:22:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because the page container doesn't strictly need to show/hide the loader.
[02:22:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It works just fine without it.
[02:23:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah true
[02:24:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, 1. The loader widget is a well-defined widget in a file on its own, like all the other widgets. 2. $.mobile.loading is deprecated and will be implemented as $.mobile.loading = function() { var loader = $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer( "loader" ); return loader.loader.apply( loader, arguments ); }
[02:24:54] <_|Nix|_> 3. $.widget( "mobile.pagecontainer", $.mobile.pagecontainer, { loader: function() /* create and maintain the loader */ }
[02:24:57] <_|Nix|_> );
[02:25:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and the loader method in an extension
[02:25:32] <_|Nix|_> 3a) ... and show/hide the loader when the pagecontainer widget is in the process of loading a page.
[02:25:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[02:25:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So you can even get rid of that - especially for packaged apps.
[02:26:01] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[02:26:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... where page loading isn't really slowed by network activity.
[02:26:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The qwuestion is, should we do this now that we're this close to beta?
[02:27:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I propose we deprecate $.mobile.loading, and create the loader method inside page container.
[02:27:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We do the extension and the removal of $.mobile.loading after 1.4.0.
[02:28:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, and that means we can wait with deprecating until 1.5
[02:28:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so you're saying we shouldn't deprecate $.mobile.loading as of 1.4.0?
[02:29:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have to stop developing at some point and only fix bugs, because otherwise we never get 1.4 out
[02:29:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we should deprecate when new code is already in place
[02:29:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Agreed. I'll write an issue for 1.5.0 to deprecate it and move the code like that.
[02:30:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if we add the loader method in 1.5 we also deprecate $.mobile.loading() in that version and remove in 1.6
[02:30:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok great, thanks
[02:30:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - I get snippetSource is not defined in the demos on master
[02:32:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for example: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/examples/swipe/swipe-page.php

[02:56:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The trivia popup is transparent. Is that intentional?
[02:56:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's hard to read.
[02:56:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, it's just not updated on master
[02:56:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Uh-oh! If you try to highlight the text in the popup, it swipes to the next city.
[02:57:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we need to check the event.target on the swipe event before we actually transition.
[02:57:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, swipe working on desktop can be bit tricky
[02:58:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or maybe the swipe event needs to be fixed so that it only fires on the elements which have bindings.
[02:58:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think I already disabled text selection for the header in that demo
[02:58:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, it works beautifully since arschmitz fixed it.
[02:59:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just mean that selecting text can trigger swipe event

[03:09:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that's true ... was that not the case before?
[03:09:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it was already the case
[03:10:12] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm :/
[03:10:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/demos/examples/swipe/swipe-page.css#L32
[03:10:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, in 1.3.2 it did the same thing, except it did it as soon as you released the mouse rather than immediately.
[03:11:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see, didn't notice that difference yet
[03:11:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That was the change he made. Don't wait for the mouseup - swipe immediately as soon as the pointer has travelled the requisite distance.
[03:12:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It makes swiping much more intuitive.
[03:12:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[03:12:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it makes the highlighting problem appear that much more accute.
[03:12:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, comes with a downside
[03:13:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, the downside was already there.
[03:13:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This change just underscores it.
[03:13:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need to figure out how come this is happening.
[03:14:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I checked and for some reason the event.target on the swipe is still the page, even though the mouse started out on the popup, not th epage.
[03:14:09] <uGoMobi> and we should test more when we make changes like this
[03:14:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now, the popup is inside the page, so that might be why, but still.
[03:14:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think this bug is bad enough to negate the benefits introduced by arschmitz's changes.
[03:15:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's just make a ticket for it and move on for now

[09:53:23] <kripper> and need some help
[09:53:32] <kripper> (race condition bug)
[09:53:36] <kripper> anyone?
[09:55:41] <uGoMobi> kripper: #jquery is the channel for support. If you found a bug please open a new issue (including test page) on GitHub
[09:55:57] <uGoMobi> thanks
[09:55:59] <kripper> I want to fix it
[09:56:11] <kripper> ok
[10:13:18] <kripper> hi
[10:13:31] <kripper> where can I contact JQM CORE developers?
[10:16:02] <kripper> I found a bug related with releasePageTransitionLock() + pageTransitionQueue and transactions starting, but never ending
[10:16:13] <kripper> I need some help to write a clean patch
[10:31:34] <uGoMobi> kripper: we, the jQuery Mobile developers, use this channel 
[10:31:52] <kripper> ok
[10:31:52] <kripper> hi
[10:31:59] <kripper> I have a problem here
[10:32:03] <kripper> a race-condition problem
[10:32:06] <uGoMobi> kripper: if you found a bug it's great if you want to help to fix it
[10:32:30] <kripper> when changePage() is called more than twice
[10:32:38] <uGoMobi> kripper: but the right way to start is to open an issue and provide a test page so we can see the bug
[10:32:40] <kripper> on the second call it is enqueued
[10:32:56] <uGoMobi> kripper: then we can help you with a PR to fix that bug
[10:33:05] <kripper> PR?
[10:33:16] <uGoMobi> kripper: sorry, pull request
[10:33:19] <kripper> ok
[10:33:37] <uGoMobi> kripper: it's very hard to look into something without a test page
[10:33:48] <kripper> I know
[10:33:56] <kripper> I justed wanted to ask for some directions
[10:34:25] <kripper> about transitionPages() not calling the done() callback
[10:35:10] <kripper> it seems like I'm hacking on contributed code
[10:35:15] <kripper> probably nobody is supporting
[10:35:48] <uGoMobi> not sure what you mean
[10:36:55] <kripper> it seems that nobody is supporting the "pageTransitionQueue" code (jblas wrote on a forum it was contributed code)
[10:37:55] <kripper> thus, I will probably be adding an issue for myself :-)
[10:43:18] <uGoMobi> kripper: pageTransitionQueue is used in pagecontainer.js (latest code) so it's part of the framework
[10:43:33] <kripper> right
[10:43:39] <kripper> I think the issue was reported here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3190
[10:43:39] <b-ot> kripper: Issue #3190 by chris-steele (21mon 2w ago): Redirecting on first load, using changePage, does not work in WebKit browsers
[10:43:41] <kripper> you know it
[10:43:45] <kripper> ;-)
[10:43:56] <kripper> they used a setTimeout
[10:44:00] <kripper> I know what the problem is
[10:44:02] <kripper> I also fixed it
[10:44:06] <kripper> but I found another problem
[10:44:09] <kripper> maybe related
[10:44:38] <kripper> do you want me to comment there?
[10:45:16] <uGoMobi> kripper: yes please
[10:45:22] <kripper> ok
[10:46:21] <uGoMobi> kripper: I can reopen the ticket if we can reproduce the issue. Again, a sample page that illustrates the issue would be really helpful
[10:46:39] <kripper> mmm
[10:46:40] <kripper> ok
[10:46:46] <kripper> I will try to automate it
[10:47:03] <kripper> but let me first explain 
[10:47:09] <kripper> maybe I can fix it with your help
[10:47:13] <kripper> faster
[10:47:15] <kripper> than reproducing

[10:59:07] <kripper> I'm struggling with bug 2 right now
[10:59:25] <kripper> any hint why transitionPages() is not executing done() ?
[11:12:59] <kripper> BTW, I needed to access the page object from JS exectued from enhancePage() and loadPage()
[11:13:12] <kripper> I found no way to access the page object, so I added a global var
[11:13:16] <kripper> (it works)
[11:13:22] <kripper> is there a official way to do it?
[11:14:45] <kripper> or is it supposed to not be necessary considering that maybe the JS code can be added to some event?
[11:32:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[11:33:08] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[11:33:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: frequent found an issue with enhanced and popup
[11:33:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but he already opened ticket for it
[11:34:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Got it.
[11:34:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was just checking if you were around when he was reporting it here on IRC
[11:34:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[11:34:35] <kripper> uGoMobi: is it ok to create a test page with a patched JQM.js?
[11:35:04] <uGoMobi> kripper: no
[11:35:07] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:35:21] <kripper> uGoMobi: mmm...ok, I understand why
[11:35:37] <kripper> uGoMobi: any hint how to avoid things like: 			KTK_JQM_THIS_PAGE = page;
[11:35:37] <kripper> 			// use the page widget to enhance

[13:40:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[13:41:05] <arschmitz> sorry whole house got the flu yesterday
[13:41:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, no!
[13:41:23] <arschmitz> finally getting online today
[13:42:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Take good care of yourselves! Drink lots of fluids - especially your son! Kids are prone to dehydration.
[13:42:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually hes the only one thats not sick :)
[13:43:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man ... this is early in the season ... flu shots are probably still in their eggs :/
[13:43:20] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[13:43:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess you will have had yours ...
[13:43:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... the hard way.
[13:43:36] <arschmitz> iv never had one in my life
[13:43:43] <arschmitz> flu shot that is
[13:43:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nor I.
[13:44:19] <arschmitz> so about the loading widget im not sure i agree it should be part of page container
[13:44:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There was a scandal here in Finland. The H1N1 flu shot contained squalene oil as an adjuvant and it gave some kids narcolepsy :(
[13:44:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It won't be.
[13:44:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, pagecontainer already loosely needs an instance to do its thing.
[13:44:54] <arschmitz> because then if you have multiple page containers you also have multiple loaders
[13:45:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good point.
[13:45:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Let's store it on the constructor then, not the global namespace.
[13:46:03] <arschmitz> yeah it should be like any other widget
[13:46:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and we can still implement the loader() public API on the pagecontainer widget.
[13:46:22] <arschmitz> but pagecontainer should also check for existance of loader before trying to use it
[13:46:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, for sure!
[13:46:33] <arschmitz> so there is no dependancy
[13:46:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I actually do that in the issue I filed.
[13:46:44] <arschmitz> which it does not currently
[13:46:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's a snippet in there.
[13:47:03] <arschmitz> ok ill check it out
[13:47:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That issue is milestoned for 1.5.0 though.
[13:47:19] <arschmitz> ok
[13:47:40] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 061-4: 02http://git.io/9gjkPQ
[13:47:41] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/061-4 14681af1f 15Jasper de Groot: You can use data-collapsed-icon="false" to have a collapsible without icons.
[13:47:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing that will be different based on this here discussion is that the loader widget will not be stored inside the pagecontainer widget as an instance variable.
[13:48:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean different between the code in the issue and the final implem.
[13:48:36] <arschmitz> yeah and it shouldnt be an extension
[13:48:44] <arschmitz> so that its not duplicated
[13:49:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What is not duplicated?
[13:49:56] <arschmitz> if its an extension to pagecontainer then you have as many loaders as you do page containers
[13:50:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nonono. I didn't make myself clear.
[13:50:08] <arschmitz> because they are one in the same
[13:50:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The loader widget is a standalone widget as it is now.
[13:50:24] <arschmitz> ok
[13:50:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The pagecontainer extension is a factoring-out of those pagecontainer methods which deal with showing/hiding the loader.
[13:50:45] <arschmitz> ok
[13:51:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, if you don't want your pagecontainer(s) to show/hide loaders, you can drop both the loader widget and the extension, and you have crisp(?) transitions.
[13:51:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I would think this might be the case on packaged apps because all pages are local.
[13:52:22] <arschmitz> right
[13:52:58] <arschmitz> makes sense
[13:53:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, that's basically my thinking for 1.5.0. Right now though, I think you're right in that we need to guard against the loader widget being absent from the build.
[13:53:30] <arschmitz> so i did a 180 on listview being a widget
[13:53:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so it shouldn't be a widget?
[13:53:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: or just make it a dependancy
[13:54:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: listview SHOULD be a widget
[13:54:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[13:54:18] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:54:18] <arschmitz> even though its not really dynamic
[13:54:41] <arschmitz> because the class additions are too complex 
[13:55:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, a widget also serves as a rack onto which to hang your extensions.
[13:55:13] <arschmitz> yup
[13:57:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway, originally I wanted to talk to you about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6475. We need to either phase out keepNative, or provide a way for widgets to become aware of it.
[13:57:42] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6475 by brickapi (1d 28m ago): Preventing auto-initialization fails under control groups
[13:58:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i looked at that already
[13:58:06] <arschmitz> simple fix
[13:58:20] <arschmitz> keepnative is now on $.mobile
[13:58:28] <arschmitz> the instance on page prototype is deprecated
[13:58:55] <arschmitz> so just need to do .not($.mobile.keepnative)
[14:00:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: make sense?
[14:00:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but I guess we'll need to do the same for collapsibleSet.
[14:00:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Skip the keepNatives.
[14:00:41] <arschmitz> yes
[14:01:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: actually it should be if( $.mobile.keepnative ) then filter it
[14:01:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was just gonna say.
[14:01:23] <arschmitz> because then it does not depend on defaults
[14:01:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't wanna hard-depend on that.
[14:01:32] <arschmitz> yup
[14:01:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, seriously, you said exactly what I was about to send off to the server :)
[14:02:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but yeah ... 
[14:02:29] <arschmitz> for the most part widgets should really only depend on widget factory where possible

[14:04:54] <Velveeta> pong
[14:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> Hey! I hear you're interested in helping out with UI/Mobile.
[14:06:03] <Velveeta> absolutely :) so i'm more interested in UI vs Mobile, but i had a question after the conference last week where they talked about the upcoming integration of both of those libraries
[14:06:36] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure i know the answer already, but the question is if we do work on UI, does it need to pass tests for Mobile? my guess is that since mobile extends UI, it should take that onus on itself
[14:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> The answer to that question today will likely depend on the specific plugin being worked on.
[14:07:56] <Velveeta> gotcha, i don't have interest in any specific plugin in particular
[14:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> We're in the middle of API redesigns in UI.
[14:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> So as the widgets go through the redesigns, the new code will have to be written with both environments in mind.

[14:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> If you haven't done any contributions yet, http://contribute.jquery.org/ has a good overview of how to get involved.
[14:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> For bug fixes, this generally isn't an issue. Either the bug is fixed or it isn't.
[14:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> For redesigns and new features, there's always a team discussion before code is written, so if you were writing new code, you'd already know what would be expected.
[14:11:02] <Velveeta> nice, i haven't done any contributions yet, but i have signed the agreement, and looked over the style guidelines for html and js
[14:11:21] <Velveeta> gotcha, i'd probably jump in with bug fixes first, to get my feet wet
[14:12:21] <_|Nix|_> Velveeta: Fixing bugs is a great way to get to know the codebase.
[14:13:00] <Velveeta> i'm pretty fluent in the factory itself, but not the ins and outs of the existing widget internals
[14:13:28] <Velveeta> and we're only on 1.9.2 i think, so i haven't looked at the guts of 1.10+ at all really, so there's definitely some learning to be done :)
[14:16:12] <Velveeta> so i'll start at contribute.jquery.org and if i get stuck anywhere, i'll drop a question in the channel here
[14:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds great. Feel free to just pick any open ticket. You may want to avoid the interactions though (draggable, droppable, resizable, selectable, sortable), since they're being rewritten as opposed to refactored.
[14:16:49] <Velveeta> sounds good, thanks
