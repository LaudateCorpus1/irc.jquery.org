[08:21:47] <gnarf> mornin everyone
[08:30:40] <gnarf> really??? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/290
[08:30:46] <gnarf> *shrug*
[08:32:24] <gnarf> I don't see the original bug when I'm trying it... am I missing something?
[08:34:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez / jzaefferer / anyone else who can: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/291 can be closed (totally invalid)
[08:34:56] <anissas> hi guys
[08:35:16] <anissas> any good documention about jqgrid?
[08:35:41] <anissas> wanna change the colname dynamically
[08:36:11] <gnarf> anissas: are you talking about the ui.grid ?
[08:36:21] <anissas> yes
[08:36:47] <gnarf> anissas: as far as I know, there aren't any great docs out there on it, but the source might help...
[08:37:07] <gnarf> I don't think the planning wiki does much on it
[08:37:11] <gnarf> can you fiddle up an example?
[08:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> hah, closed
[08:37:21] <anissas> yes
[08:37:27] <anissas> a simple one
[08:37:34] <gnarf> anissas: please ;)
[08:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> anissas: are you talking about the actual plugin named jqgrid?
[08:37:46] <anissas> cuz im newbe in jq and jqui
[08:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> I assume yes, since we don't have an actual grid yet
[08:38:14] <anissas> the plugin
[08:38:20] <gnarf> anissas: not made by ui ;)
[08:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> that's not part of jQuery UI
[08:38:38] <gnarf> anissas: you should fiddle up an example and ask in #jquery if someone can help
[08:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> you'll need to ask about that in #jquery
[08:38:53] <anissas> ok tnx :)
[08:38:56] * scott_gonzalez leaves again since gnarf is so helpful
[08:39:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I wanna try to setup color for pull this week
[08:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG!!!!11
[08:39:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: think that might happen? / what do I need to do?
[08:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> well, it's technically a core plugin
[08:40:26] <gnarf> right
[08:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> but I could look it over
[08:41:25] <gnarf> I'd appreciate it ;)  I'm gonna poke resig about it @ #jquery-meeting today

[08:51:59] <ajpiano> bit.ly/jquigitjs
[08:52:02] <gnarf> just spent like 5 mins browsing jqueryui.com
[08:52:02] <ajpiano> bit.ly/jquigitcss

[08:53:28] <anissas> tnx to you
[08:53:52] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NmLck/ -- bookmarkable edge build for jQuery/jQuery-ui to fork from
[08:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: it's on the sidebar of jqueryui.com
[08:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> work in progress
[08:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> the link says master/WIP build
[09:03:02] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/294 pullable - verified fixed & working in IE 7/8
[09:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: thanks, I've got a few pull requests in my inbox that I need to pull based on your comments
[09:07:08] <gnarf> tryin to help
[09:07:10] <gnarf> before we get to 50
[09:07:11] <gnarf> ;)
[09:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'll pull them when I get to working on UI again
[09:23:05] <ajpiano> gnarf woot

[09:24:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, I just got the same messages ;)
[09:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:33:18] <jzaefferer> its probably broken in various ways, but this is really a feature we need eventually in slider: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/329/files
[09:44:35] <danheberden> is richard still in brazil?
[12:36:26] <gnarf> is there a way to ant only the uncompressed files?
[12:36:48] <gnarf> other than like starting ant and breaking it once closure compiler starts eating cpu?
[13:00:39] <jzaefferer> likely, though not sure what you want to do
[13:10:57] <gnarf> i want to build a shell script that will make jquery / jquery-ui from source so that I can setup a jsFiddle that links to my local copies and not have to worry about sucking up 6 minutes for it to minify
[13:21:12] <gnarf> hey jstroem
[13:46:29] <jstroem> hi gnarf
[13:46:54] <jstroem> did you get any info on the xml setup for the doc?
[13:47:08] <gnarf> not yet, hadn't had a chance to talk to richard
[13:47:22] <gnarf> he's been out of town
[13:47:41] <jstroem> okay! i been looking a little into the text effects
[13:48:00] <gnarf> and?
[13:49:12] <jstroem> hmm you said that the text effects should have their own functions?
[13:49:19] <jstroem> like .showText .hideText..
[13:50:03] <gnarf> thats what we came up with before
[13:50:35] <gnarf> $.effects.text could be where to store the actual effect function
[13:51:13] <gnarf> .toggleText() might be handy too -- not sure how handy
[13:51:22] <jstroem> yep ino.. not that.. im took a look of the implementations on .show/.hide/.effects and i cant really se what more to put in them in the new things.
[13:52:10] <gnarf> well .show / .hide need to deal with a bunch of non-effect signatures and stuff too
[13:53:16] <jstroem> yeah ofc.. but i will try to refactor it a bit and see if i can get it up to this weekend!
[13:53:36] <jstroem> the code looks exactly like what i had before i ported it to jQuery so it shouldn't be that hard!
[13:56:34] <jzaefferer> gnarf, you can call individual targets in the ant build directly, something like this should work: "ant clean copy concatenate"
[13:57:22] <gnarf> jzaefferer: cool thanks for the tip, that should help

[14:54:07] <jzaefferer> I maded you a pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/332
[14:54:20] <jzaefferer> as if we didn't already have enough of em!
[16:22:55] <gnarf> jzaefferer: :/ ;)
[16:23:06] <gnarf> you made the 50th
[16:26:45] <jzaefferer> yay /o\
[16:26:48] <jzaefferer> good night!
[16:27:02] <gnarf> ciao
[16:28:52] <gnarf> jzaefferer: btw, jqbug.com supports UI now... http://jqbug.com/ui/p332
[16:45:19] <gnarf> ummm - scott_gonzalez / anyone else... we hate $.browser.msie checks as much as jQuery core right? :)
[17:38:26] <gnarf> okay, i made it through like 7 pulls
[17:38:30] <gnarf> gotta take a break
[17:38:43] <gnarf> some of these are just silly...
[17:58:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yes, we hate $.browser as much as core
[17:59:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: k - one of kborchers was sniffing ie6 using it
[17:59:33] <gnarf> i noticed a ton of $.browser.opera and $.browser.msie's when I was searching the code
[17:59:36] <gnarf> so figured I'd ask
[17:59:37] <gnarf> :)
[18:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, you'll also notice a ton of complete crap when searching the code :-)
[18:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> there's a reason we're spending so much time on refactoring and rewriting widgets right now ;-)
[18:01:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :) yeah --- I just ran into some horrid looking code
[18:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> let me guess: one of the interactions
[18:02:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: whatever it was had like a line of code with 6 tabs then a comment
[18:02:16] <gnarf> pretty sure it was resizable
[18:02:33] <gnarf> i couldn't tell wtf it was doing
[18:02:34] <gnarf> no
[18:02:36] <gnarf> droppable
[18:02:40] <gnarf> it was in the manager
[18:02:48] <gnarf> recalculating something
[18:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, those code is really hard to follow
[18:03:05] <gnarf> looping all the drop targets looking for something
[18:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> there's a reason we never fix those bugs
[18:03:15] <gnarf> it used a label: for() { continue label; } too
[18:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> wow
[18:03:45] <gnarf> i kinda gave up and was like "well - it seems like this patch that calls this shitty function fixed the problem"
[18:03:57] <gnarf> "even tho i still don't know why, it works *shrug* "
[18:05:29] <gnarf> im takin the rest of the night off from coding - brain is fried after only 8 pull requests
[18:05:35] <gnarf> that shit is hard to review
[18:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it's tricky
