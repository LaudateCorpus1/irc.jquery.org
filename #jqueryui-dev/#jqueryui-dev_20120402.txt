[08:28:12] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: First iteration on grunt-based build. lint, qunit, concat, min and zip all work, but all have various limiations.
[08:28:12] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Add list of included files to min banner
[08:28:13] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Use isoDate format for min banner
[08:28:13] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Switch to adm-zip. Use addFile method until addLocalFile is implemented.
[08:28:14] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Extend concat and min tasks to include all the files the current build includes. Headers aren't correct yet.
[08:28:14] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Custom banners for the various minified files
[08:28:15] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: cleanup
[08:28:15] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Minify CSS files, using sqwish.
[08:28:16] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Update banner template to use task.current.data.src when no file list is given.
[08:28:17] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: First draft for cdn tasks. Hashing works fine, zip file doesn't quite match the intended structure.
[08:28:17] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Almost complete release and release_cdn tasks. Concat task fails to strip headers, everything else is in place.
[08:28:17] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Partial download_themes task. Extracting currently fails with crc32 checksum failure
[08:28:18] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Extend themes_download task with unzipping
[08:28:18] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Finish release_themes task. Strip headers from concatenated files.
[08:28:19] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Cleanup todos
[08:28:19] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Add sizer task. Some cleanup in other areas.
[08:28:19] <jzaefferer> oh noes
[08:28:20] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Add back version.txt. Will remove that later along with the old build files, until then its useful to compare the new system against the old.
[08:28:31] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Grunt: Switch back to using file.copy().
[08:28:32] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Grunt: Update for new grunt API.
[08:28:32] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Extract css related tasks, use grunt-css instead
[08:28:33] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Accept more grunt-css versions
[08:28:33] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Use grunt.loadNpmTasks, now that its actually working
[08:28:34] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Add download_docs task for 1.8
[08:28:34] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Grunt: Move common modules to top, along with lists of files.
[08:28:35] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Protect all copyright notices against minification
[08:28:35] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: grunt.file.copy now expects options as third argument. Fixes the version replacing
[08:28:36] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Fix dependencies to versions we've tested against. No more surprise API changes, for now
[08:28:36] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Build/grunt: Strip existing (protected) headers from to-be-minified CSS files
[08:28:37] <jq-jenkins> * Scott González: Grunt: Copy jquery from root regardless of version; fix include list for minified CSS files.

[10:37:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers gnarf: any ideas why the bounce effect is broken? http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/tooltip/animations.html the others work fine
[10:39:56] <jzaefferer> standalone bounce also works
[10:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure, I can look into it.
[10:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> Normal bounce show works: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/show/default.html
[11:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> I found the problem: There's no duration being passed in. Now I just need to figure out whose fault that is: widget, effects core or bounce...
[11:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Thoughts on killing the return here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.effects.core.js#L487
[11:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that jzaefferer is pasing a hash with just an effect name.
[11:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> Bounce expects that duration will always be set.
[11:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be nice if effects could assume all required properties will always be set.
[11:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> Could chain all the ifs as else ifs and just invert the shortcut.
[11:34:44] <gnarf> hrm
[11:35:32] <gnarf> makes sense
[11:36:20] <gnarf> might even be able to do options=effect; effect={effect: options.effect}
[11:36:34] <gnarf> er just the first would be enough
[11:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll write some tests and then update that.
[11:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> I only suggested the else ifs because they're all exclusive, no need to do all the checks.
[11:49:05] <gnarf> some of them are fall throughs

[19:40:19] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[19:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell gnarf Should we consider using clip for a lot of our animations? Will it improve things like explode which gets wonky with borders?
