[01:25:09] <bso> hi
[02:11:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg: Sorry if I seem a bit OCD over consistency :-) I would like us to agree on whether within the api docs links to other api docs pages should be relative or absolute. We have a combination of both. I would be in favor of relative URLs so that if we're checking on local or stage, we go to the correct corresponding place and not the live page... what do you think?
[02:12:39] <agcolom> oops sorry, wrong channel! will put that on content...
[04:36:17] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Maybe, maybe not. Note that the limit is set per account, not by organisation afaik. How do you see the limit on the "jquery-testswarm" account? Anyway, they replied and said they raised the limit and reset it for this month.
[05:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: We have a corporate account and I'm prety sure the time is shared among all users.
[05:38:46] <Krinkle> k
[05:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> When they say they increased our time limit, I think they multiplied it by 100 :-)
[05:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> JavaScript Testing time left: 1666617 hours 54 minutes 44 seconds
[05:40:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: they just threw on a few zeros for good measure
[05:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> If only everything worked that way.
[05:41:17] <arschmitz> yeah i could use a few zeros on my wages lol
[05:41:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around
[05:42:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[05:42:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv been looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5534
[05:42:38] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #5534 by dzhongxu (5mon 2w ago): Swipe is buggy on some Android devices
[05:43:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is not a problem with swipe its a problem with the demos i think
[05:43:45] <arschmitz> i cant get the demo to work at all not even by hitting the button to go to the next page
[05:44:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is that on latest?
[05:44:33] <uGoMobi> or 1.3?
[05:44:39] <arschmitz> master
[05:44:49] <arschmitz> i made a jsbin to test swipe
[05:45:02] <arschmitz> and i happen to have all the devices mention in the ticket at the moment :)
[05:45:06] <uGoMobi> I haven't updated examples yet, so maybe something is broken
[05:45:08] <arschmitz> and all work fine in jsbin
[05:45:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we fix by deleting our demo? ;)
[05:46:07] <uGoMobi> anyways... good to know
[05:46:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually im looking now and its broken on everything its a js error
[05:46:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: very possible
[05:46:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its page container
[05:47:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does it reveal a bug in framework or is this a problem in the demo custom JS?
[05:47:27] <arschmitz> not sure im looking now
[05:47:46] <arschmitz> i just noticed right this moment
[05:47:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you test 1.3 demo on Android?
[05:47:56] <arschmitz> sure
[05:48:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe you should test 1.3-stable on view
[05:49:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we had all these issues with our demos in 1.3.1 release
[05:49:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahhh good point
[05:52:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: s3 is a bit buggy s1 is actually perfect
[05:52:54] <arschmitz> but s3 was perfect on master in jsbin so maybe i inadvertently fixed it lol 
[05:53:08] <arschmitz> or maybe its the demo
[05:54:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are there any other demos that use prefetch?
[05:55:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I dunno but could do a search
[05:56:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[05:56:18] <uGoMobi> only that swipe demo
[05:56:39] <arschmitz> ok im wondering if its yet another prefetch issue
[05:57:05] <arschmitz> do we not have any tests for prefetch lol?
[05:57:08] <uGoMobi> you fixed on in 1.3.1 right?
[05:57:13] <arschmitz> i need to check that 
[05:57:23] <uGoMobi> s/on/one
[05:57:50] <arschmitz> its either on master or 1.3.1 not sure which
[05:58:00] <arschmitz> but now its all different because of content widget
[05:58:45] <arschmitz> i mean 1.3 stable or 1.3.1
[05:59:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think there was an issue reported for our new demos
[05:59:21] <uGoMobi> we added those in 1.3.0
[05:59:30] <uGoMobi> so it must be fixed in 1.3.1
[05:59:42] <uGoMobi> *have been fixed
[05:59:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes i was saying im not sure if it was fixed for 1.3.1 or if its only on 1.3-stable
[06:00:15] <uGoMobi> I am pretty sure the fix landed in 1.3.1
[06:01:38] <arschmitz> hmmm its not a generic prefetch issue
[06:01:48] <arschmitz> so maybe its the demo
[06:02:19] <uGoMobi> time for a new demo then :)
[06:03:37] <arschmitz> i need to look more to be sure want to make sure its not a framework issue
[06:04:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, it's worth investigating this a bit more
[06:06:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there is an issue with ext-panels destroy method
[06:06:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok ill look when your done
[06:06:45] <uGoMobi> it wasn't updatedyet  to take external panels into account
[06:07:14] <uGoMobi> but the thing is... we check if other panels exists on the page
[06:07:54] <arschmitz> i see should be a simple fix there is a check built in for if the panel is in a page
[06:08:08] <uGoMobi> right
[06:08:08] <arschmitz> so if it is not in a page we can skip that
[06:08:41] <uGoMobi> but if you have a panel in the page and outside the page
[06:08:48] <uGoMobi> it won't skip
[06:09:03] <uGoMobi> and will remove classes from the page and break external panels
[06:09:06] <arschmitz> if the panel is in the page it wont care about ones outside the page
[06:09:25] <arschmitz> oh i see what your saying 
[06:09:29] <uGoMobi> but both internal and external panels add classes to the page
[06:09:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: still fixable
[06:09:59] <uGoMobi> I can't really finish because they don't work properly because of this
[06:10:03] <arschmitz> if a page exists check if the active page contains panels
[06:10:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you push your changes i can fix it
[06:12:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the problem with swipe demo is in the demo if i remove the custom JS the error goes away and if i remove prefetch the error goes away 
[06:12:46] <arschmitz> but the two togeather are causing an issue
[06:13:45] <uGoMobi> hmm
[06:14:07] <arschmitz> still need to look closer though i dont see anything that should not work in there
[06:14:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: re: panels. I can't really test my changes because I get errors
[06:15:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I wan't to make changes in _wrapper that cause an error too and I think it's relelated
[06:15:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm ok ill look in a few minutes and push changes
[06:16:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am gonna make a new branch out of ext-panels local and then revert changes in ext-panels
[06:16:09] <uGoMobi> and push
[06:16:19] <uGoMobi> just want to keep my commits somewhere
[06:16:44] <arschmitz> im confused lol if you revert your changes what are you pushing ?
[06:17:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: two or three commits that we want to keep
[06:17:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:17:39] <arschmitz> ok

[06:32:15] <uGoMobi> should I do "$ git pull --rebase origin master" to avoid the merge commits?
[06:35:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I added my test page in ext-panels branch... demos/test/panels/
[06:35:38] <arschmitz> ok cool
[06:35:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: after you fixed destroy can you test this...
[06:36:04] <arschmitz> yup
[06:36:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: go to page "b" > back to "a" > to "b" again and then open right panel
[06:36:48] <uGoMobi> this shows an error now
[06:36:55] <arschmitz> ok
[06:37:38] <uGoMobi> same for page "c" so it's about pages that are removed because they are not the initial page
[06:37:52] <arschmitz> no problem it should be a quick fix
[06:38:05] <uGoMobi> great, thanks!
[06:38:17] <uGoMobi> I go finish grunticon in the meantime
[06:57:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ugh panel really needs some good review work
[06:58:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so what did you come up with as far as not wrapping panels?
[06:58:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it sure does
[06:58:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: as long as we keep supporting panels inside page we need to wrap
[06:59:12] <uGoMobi> I just was just working on making the animations work when outside page
[06:59:29] <uGoMobi> I also want to change that we set ui-body- for the wrapper
[07:00:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah we had talked about animating page rather then wrapping contents before was not sure if you had looked at that
[07:00:22] <arschmitz> but i think we would need to deprecate reveal as a transition
[07:00:25] <uGoMobi> I am going to set overlay theme for ui-mobile-viewport to same theme as panel
[07:00:36] <arschmitz> to make that work
[07:00:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool
[07:01:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: reveal is most popular
[07:01:12] <uGoMobi> I dont see deprecating that as an option
[07:01:19] <arschmitz> yeah i dont think we can avoid the wrapper then
[07:01:31] <uGoMobi> I had reveal working
[07:01:58] <uGoMobi> just dealing with android zoom issues
[07:02:05] <arschmitz> really? wow awesome 
[07:02:05] <uGoMobi> but on iOS it was just fine
[07:02:26] <arschmitz> i couldnt think of a way to make it work around a webkit bug i found
[07:02:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the other thing is true persistent toolbars
[07:02:42] <uGoMobi> they are outside page so we have a 3rd case there
[07:03:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it worked on iOS6 and iOS5 on BS
[07:03:22] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:03:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you made those test pages specific to your PC lol
[07:03:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it would be a lot easier if panel is always outside page
[07:03:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ohwwwww
[07:03:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that can be done
[07:04:02] <uGoMobi> stupid me
[07:04:12] <uGoMobi> can you reach my localhost? ;)
[07:04:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:04:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can reposition panels and you will just always have to explicitly set a theme on panels
[07:04:40] <uGoMobi> I just copied them in quickly so you could see that error
[07:04:55] <arschmitz> i see an error all right its called a 404 :)
[07:05:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:07:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok what do you think? should we move panels outside the page like we do with popups?
[07:08:08] <arschmitz> yes if it makes it a lot easier
[07:08:18] <uGoMobi> it does for sure
[07:10:39] <arschmitz> then yeah i say we do it
[07:11:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I wasn't sure what was worse for performance, the wrapper or the repositioning
[07:11:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm not sure but there is a nice thing about repositioning
[07:12:27] <arschmitz> you detach from the dom so you can do all manip on the panel it self while not in the dom which is much faster
[07:12:59] <uGoMobi> yeah that's nice
[07:13:29] <arschmitz> i had _|Nix|_ do that with collapsible heading the other day because on chrome its not too different but on like android 2.3 its 60% faster
[07:13:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok then you don't have to change _destroy now, I will rewrite it anyway
[07:13:44] <arschmitz> lol ok
[07:13:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that jsperf test
[07:14:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in case you need it this might be helpful
[07:14:14] <arschmitz> $("body>:mobile-panel").length + $.mobile.activePage.find(":mobile-panel").length
[07:14:25] <uGoMobi> to check if the page have a panel?
[07:14:38] <arschmitz> that gives you the total number of panels in the active page plus those in the body
[07:14:48] <uGoMobi> nice, thanks
[07:15:08] <uGoMobi> so if it's 1 I can destroy everything
[07:15:13] <arschmitz> exactly
[07:15:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:15:23] <arschmitz> anything > 1 panels are still in play
[07:18:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: let me know if you need anything for panels 
[07:18:37] <arschmitz> and ill jump in on that
[07:18:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks, will do
[07:19:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill be able to review and slim down panels a lot once they dont need to wrap stuff that complicated stuff A LOT
[07:19:30] <uGoMobi> cool
[07:19:37] <uGoMobi> we need to add refresh method too
[07:19:53] <arschmitz> i bet we will be able to cut ~50% of whats there now with this change and a good review
[07:20:20] <uGoMobi> yeah, I already had some stuff removed and now it will be even more
[07:20:26] <uGoMobi> less is more :)
[07:20:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: does it really need a refresh what needs to update on refresh?
[07:20:40] <arschmitz> as long as it has proper option setting
[07:21:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5659
[07:21:10] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5659 by frequent (4mon 3w ago): Panel: refresh method missing
[07:21:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: with out wrapping thats not an issue
[07:23:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it might be because we still have those true persistent toolbars
[07:23:34] <arschmitz> yea we need to decide how to handle that
[07:23:35] <uGoMobi> those are outside the page
[07:23:55] <arschmitz> because to animate those like we do now will mean wrapping those + page
[07:24:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[07:24:20] <uGoMobi> we apply transition to the fixed toolbar itself
[07:24:43] <arschmitz> i thought that was the point of the wrapper that doing that made the transition get weird
[07:24:54] <uGoMobi> that's how we do it now because fixed toolbars are not inside the wrapper
[07:26:05] <arschmitz> right and with true persistant they wont be inside the "wrapper" either
[07:26:20] <uGoMobi> yup
[07:26:35] <arschmitz> so we will have to wrape those and the page to do that right?
[07:26:44] <uGoMobi> no
[07:27:04] <arschmitz> im confused
[07:27:10] <uGoMobi> with "normal" fixed toolbars they are inside the page
[07:27:16] <uGoMobi> so we can just animate the page
[07:27:16] <arschmitz> right
[07:27:32] <uGoMobi> with persistent fixed toolbars those are outside the page
[07:27:39] <arschmitz> right
[07:27:43] <uGoMobi> so we animate both the toolbars and the page
[07:27:49] <uGoMobi> without wrapper
[07:28:07] <arschmitz> ok but wasent the reason for the wrapper because animating all 3 items at the same time didnt work well?
[07:28:15] <uGoMobi> that's what we do now... fixed toolbars aren't in the wrapper, we apply animation to toolbars and wrapper
[07:28:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they are in the wrapper
[07:28:33] <arschmitz> now
[07:29:06] <arschmitz> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/ inspecet the page header and footer are inside ui-panel-content-wrap
[07:29:25] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/panels/panel-fixed.php
[07:29:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am talking about fixed toolbars
[07:29:54] <uGoMobi> normal inline toolbars are inside the wrapper
[07:30:10] <arschmitz> oh ok i guess i didnt realize we handled them different
[07:30:30] <uGoMobi> yeah I changed that so we didn't have to switch them to inline
[07:31:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats easy to solve though
[07:31:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what is easy to solve?
[07:31:55] <arschmitz> worrying about true persistant toolbars
[07:32:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah we can do the same as what we do for all fixed toolbars now
[07:33:36] <arschmitz> yeah and to check if we need to do anything its just $("body > :jqmdata(position=fixed)")
[07:34:58] <arschmitz> ok so it sounds like this should be a go
[07:36:35] <uGoMobi> ok, I am on it
[07:49:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, Im working on DB to support AMD build. Im using modernizr's way-to-use-requirejs-to-build as a baseline. I was going to wrap some UI files to use as sample-test on the development, and that's not much different than wrapping UI files as we need it to be anyway. So, shall I go ahead and make that change on UI too (creating a branch and a subsequent PR)?
[07:50:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:50:50] <rxaviers> great ;)
[07:51:19] <rxaviers> Another thing... Do you want UI's `grunt build` task to be updated as well? (to use the same technique above)
[07:59:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: found the issue in the demo 
[07:59:59] <arschmitz> and its NOT the demo
[08:00:09] <arschmitz> its the framework
[08:00:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what was it?
[08:00:30] <arschmitz> im suprised this passed all the tests
[08:00:46] <arschmitz> its impossible to call loadpage without a second argument
[08:09:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: fixed the issue running tests now to make sure it didnt break anything
[08:10:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great

[09:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks
[09:00:14] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thanks for getting it set up (you and whoever else)
[09:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> I was just me, with a kick from Yehuda.
[09:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> He complained about paper :-P
[09:01:13] <johnbender> :)
[09:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm waiting on a response from Joel for one final thing regarding to the CLA, which will hopefully get us to a point where I can automate the CLA checks :-)
[09:08:17] <arschmitz> johnbender: have you tried adobe edge inspect?
[09:10:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: ping
[09:10:45] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[09:11:18] <frequent> I think I cleaned up the code except for a few things. 
[09:11:33] <frequent> I will do a demo page on the weekend
[09:11:56] <frequent> but no time for the table refresh
[09:12:21] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks for cleaning that up
[09:12:43] <frequent> np, next time will be quicker
[09:13:11] <arschmitz> frequent: didnt you have the widgetized refresh methods for table basicly done before?
[09:13:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: we will look into table refresh
[09:13:26] <frequent> arschmitz: yes. I have not had time to look at them
[09:13:28] <frequent> though
[09:13:30] <uGoMobi> frequent: right, I was about to ask what arschmitz just asked
[09:13:32] <frequent> I can post them tonight
[09:13:44] <frequent> and then we can see if there's a lot to be done or not
[09:13:50] <frequent> post = PR
[09:13:53] <arschmitz> that would be great easier to clean up what needs to there then start from scratch im sure
[09:14:15] <frequent> ok, so let me try to PR tonight and then see if it can be cleaned up
[09:14:29] <uGoMobi> frequent: that would be great
[09:14:32] <frequent> can someone have a look on the PR?
[09:14:32] <uGoMobi> thanks a lot!
[09:14:35] <frequent> once it's up
[09:14:50] <frequent> I will probably have some time on Sunday
[09:15:08] <frequent> so I could work in feedback
[09:15:10] <arschmitz> frequent: any PR's you would like me to look at im happy to
[09:15:17] <frequent> ok. good.
[09:15:25] <frequent> so. PR late tonight
[09:15:29] <arschmitz> ok
[09:15:37] <arschmitz> late for you maybe :)
[09:15:51] <frequent> ;-)
[09:15:51] <arschmitz> late for me would mean tomorrow for you :)
[09:16:14] <frequent> matter of perspective
[09:16:24] <arschmitz> lol
[09:16:25] <frequent> one more question...
[09:16:29] <uGoMobi> oh I thought it was just timezones
[09:16:49] <frequent> so last week I was trying to €(".foo") my own Euro selector...
[09:17:05] <frequent> which will not work of course...
[09:17:10] <arschmitz> euro selector lol
[09:17:25] <frequent> any idea how to extend the $() selector for objects?
[09:17:44] <frequent> $( myobject )
[09:17:53] <frequent> not easy to find anything on it
[09:18:00] <arschmitz> what exactly would this do
[09:18:01] <arschmitz> ?
[09:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> frequent: It's not nearly as nice, but window[ "€" ] does work. Just annoying that it has to be quoted and therefore referenced as a property.
[09:18:49] <frequent> yeah, but you will have a hard time typing it outside of EU... :-)
[09:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing special to do for $( obj )
[09:19:34] <frequent> ok... let me translate from my French colleague. 1sec
[09:21:37] <johnbender> arschmitz: nope, you mean for multiple device setup?
[09:22:18] <arschmitz> yea
[09:22:29] <arschmitz> seems like it could be useful for like theme testing and stuff
[09:22:43] <arschmitz> not so much for JS
[09:22:56] <frequent> scott_gonzalez: ok. translate.
[09:22:59] <frequent> "I would like to do $(this) during execution of a function, where the "this", is an javascript object (instance of a custom class) which knows (from a local property) how to fetch the DOM/Jquery context.
[09:23:00] <frequent> Doing $(this) instead of $(this.local_property) is to provide "sugar" for the developer (who doesn't care how the object is implemented)
[09:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's very different than what I thought you were asking about.
[09:23:50] <frequent> hm... :-)
[09:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's fairly simple though.
[09:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> The jQuery() function is actually just a one liner.
[09:24:30] <frequent> I like "simple"
[09:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> So you can change it to be whatever you want.
[09:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> So you'd change it to use whatever logic you want for getting the actual elements from the object.
[09:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> Then pass that to `new jQuery.fn.init()`.
[09:25:53] <frequent> ok. we tried to not monkeypatch, but this will do, of course.
[09:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> You just need to remember to add `jQuery.fn.init.prototype = jQuery.fn;` after you redefine jQuery.
[09:26:08] <frequent> ok
[09:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> And you probably need to store a reference to the old jQuery.fn so you can restore that after you redefine the constructor.
[09:26:41] <frequent> noted aswell
[09:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to recall a discussion about this a while ago.
[09:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> Don't remember if it was in the bug tracker or forums though.
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> Not really sure what terms I would use to search for the discussion.
[09:28:09] <frequent> ok. I think we have something to work with. 
[09:28:11] <frequent> Thanks
[09:28:30] <frequent> If we get lost, I will end up here again ;-)
[09:30:09] <gseguin> mornin'
[09:30:51] <frequent> morning. and bye (train to catch)

[09:55:43] <gseguin_> question for whoever knows the transition code
[09:56:09] <arschmitz> gseguin_: im semi familier if no one else around knows it better
[09:56:10] <gseguin_> it looks like we could save a call to scrollPage whenever the transition is set to none
[09:56:50] <gseguin_> in startIn we could test if ( none ) before calling scrollPage
[09:57:05] <gseguin_> or rather if ( !none )
[09:57:12] <gseguin_> arschmitz: what do you think?
[09:57:24] <arschmitz> gseguin_: looking at the code now
[09:57:29] <gseguin_> k
[09:57:40] <gseguin_> le me know I've gotta run in 2 min
[09:57:44] <gseguin_> but I'll be on later

[12:36:22] <_|Nix|__> arschmitz: If we have an pre-rendered widget, what happens during _destroy? Do we destroy or do we leave it as is - after all, destroying it would not restore the state to what it was ...
[12:36:26] <_|Nix|__> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:37:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|__: hey
[12:37:18] <_|Nix|__> Gah! I've grown an underscore ...
[12:37:49] <_|Nix|_> There we go.
[12:39:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whats up?
[12:40:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we have an pre-rendered widget, what happens during _destroy? Do we destroy or do we leave it as is - after all, destroying it would not restore the state to what it was ...
[12:40:13] <arschmitz> leave as is
[12:40:36] <arschmitz> already discussed this with both scott and uGoMobi and every one is in agreement 
[12:40:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So, if ( this.options.enhanced ) { return }
[12:40:50] <_|Nix|_> s/return/return;/
[12:40:58] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[12:40:58] <arschmitz> unless there is some shared event you need to potentially unbind or something
[12:41:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah ... there are.
[12:41:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, NM - they're all attached with ._on
[12:41:43] <arschmitz> but it should be no more then that and thats a pretty special case
[12:42:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool. In the case of popup, I still have to close it though. So, only the unenhance portion is short-circuited.
[12:42:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:42:27] <arschmitz> there will be special things in some
[12:42:29] <_|Nix|_> Sounds good!
[12:42:36] <arschmitz> like panels care if other panels exist on destroy
[12:43:10] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[12:43:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5534 im closing this
[12:43:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[12:43:27] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #5534 by dzhongxu (5mon 2w ago): Swipe is buggy on some Android devices
[12:43:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I guess we have to change some event bindings in panel to _on
[12:43:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[12:43:46] <arschmitz> and a bunch of off vs _off in there too
[12:44:06] <uGoMobi> right
[12:44:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I think we can close that swipe ticket
[12:44:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hat swipe issue though im closing i tested on every device i have so far a few minutes ago
[12:44:40] <arschmitz> and its perfect on every device
[12:44:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe post your JSBin as proof
[12:44:46] <arschmitz> not a hicup
[12:44:48] <arschmitz> already done
[12:44:54] <arschmitz> thats how i tested was a jsbin
[12:44:55] <uGoMobi> I also tested on WP8
[12:45:06] <arschmitz> yeah i tested everythign not just android
[12:45:17] <arschmitz> and put full list in comment
[12:45:36] <uGoMobi> because that guy that open ticket yesterday (and same one today) was complaining about WP8 too
[12:45:49] <uGoMobi> *opened
[12:45:51] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #5534: Swipe is buggy on some Android devices  02http://git.io/dbaNTw
[12:45:57] <arschmitz> yeah i saw that thats why i just went ahead and tested everything
[12:46:11] <uGoMobi> great
[12:46:26] <arschmitz> hard to argue with that list of devices :)
[12:48:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Woah ... I just realized something ... I might be setting any number of options on a popup - like theme, overlayTheme, shadow, whatever. I have to remember what the values of the options were initially so I can restore the initial list of classes ...
[12:48:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:48:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm thats another question all together
[12:49:02] <arschmitz> should we restore original options if someone changes them
[12:49:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and I'm not sure how to handle that.
[12:49:14] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you about?
[12:49:18] <uGoMobi> restore when?
[12:49:22] <arschmitz> destroy
[12:49:51] <arschmitz> i would say no but that kinda breaks the promise of destroy
[12:50:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that depends on how the promise is defined. Does the promise refer exclusively to DOM structure, or does it include attributes as well.
[12:50:33] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:51:16] <arschmitz> "Removes the widget functionality completely. This will return the element back to its pre-init state."
[12:51:31] <_|Nix|_> D0000d!
[12:51:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I smell a call to _setOptions() as part of _destroy()
[12:52:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe 
[12:52:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: this._origOptions = $.extend( {}, this.options );
[12:52:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and stuff like that.
[12:52:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[12:53:05] <arschmitz> i think id like scott_gonzalez: oppinion on this one when hes around
[12:53:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[12:55:02] <_|Nix|_> Man, this is a whole 'nother can 'o worms.
[12:55:17] <_|Nix|_> s/'o/o'/
[12:55:53] <_|Nix|_> That latter replace operations summarizes the expression on my face as well ...
[12:56:03] <arschmitz> lol
[12:56:15] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and my hands too ... up in the air like that.
[12:58:58] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'm back
[13:00:01] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6160: Popup: Do not remove elements upon _destroy if the "enhanced" option is true  02http://git.io/82hkAw
[13:00:20] <_|Nix|_> I filed that since the popup review is already merged.
[13:00:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: switching to https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/jqueryPlugin.js wont cause any issues with the build or builder will it?
[13:01:10] <gseguin> arschmitz: nope don't think so
[13:01:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok cool because thats is what was decided to go with in the meeting last week
[13:01:42] <arschmitz> so i wanted to check before i make any changes
[13:02:14] <gseguin> to replace the IFFE in each module?
[13:04:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah and the current amd set up https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/63cc2acac2cf680efe9331449c8e90c0bf1fca1f/ui/jquery.ui.accordion.js
[13:04:58] <gseguin> ok, don't you want to wrap that in the pragma to not include it the build? 
[13:05:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: also notice no longer guarding against redefined undefined 
[13:05:11] <gseguin> I know we need to move to onBuildWrite
[13:05:24] <gseguin> but for now we use pragmas
[13:05:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah thats a ui file thats not us
[13:05:36] <arschmitz> i was just using it as an example
[13:05:57] <gseguin> oh so wait
[13:06:14] <gseguin> is that the wrapper in the jquery.mobile.js bundle ?
[13:06:20] <gseguin> or in each module ?
[13:06:27] <arschmitz> each module
[13:06:27] <gseguin> or both?
[13:06:49] <arschmitz> well both i would think i guess
[13:07:37] <gseguin> ok so make sure you update build/wrap.start and build/wrap.end accordingly
[13:07:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok
[13:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'm back.
[13:08:09] <arschmitz> its not something ill be doing this week or anything probably next week or week after
[13:08:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok so with the enhanced option concept
[13:08:38] <gseguin> also you probably want to keep the (function( $ ) { }( jQuery )) IFFE in the built version for each module
[13:08:40] <arschmitz> do you this we should save the original options so they can be restored on destroy?
[13:08:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: true
[13:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[13:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> Parsing data attributes and storing them so you can restore those values at the end?
[13:09:40] <arschmitz> ok so we discussed that destroy would basicly do nothing
[13:09:59] <arschmitz> well not data attribute per se but save the original option object or something
[13:10:23] <arschmitz> so if they change an option at some point it will still restore back to true original state
[13:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you just weren't going to do anything at all for destroy on an enhanced widget.
[13:10:54] <arschmitz> yea thats what i would like
[13:11:01] <gseguin> arschmitz: looking at it closer, it might not work with pragmas
[13:11:19] <arschmitz> but _|Nix|_ brought up options so thought id just double check with you
[13:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really understand how the options come into play.
[13:11:32] <gseguin> we probably want to move ot onBuildWrite so we can rewrite that wrapper with the IFFE
[13:11:33] <arschmitz> seems kinda crazy to store original options to restore them but it could be done
[13:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Options are not part of the original markup.
[13:12:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand what you'd be restoring.
[13:12:09] <arschmitz> well options set classes
[13:12:12] <arschmitz> often
[13:12:26] <arschmitz> so they would have placed those classes on the elements already
[13:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: From http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/66995889/AMD-Support: "No pragmas (as Mobile has right now) to remove for non-AMD build: Use alternative to remove the define wrapper, e.g. using the r.js' onBuildWrite callback"
[13:13:06] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: yup it's on the todo list
[13:13:08] <arschmitz> so to truely restore to original state those classes for any option that changed would have to be restored
[13:13:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If setting an option results in adding a class on the original markup then that class needs to be removed upon _destroy, right?
[13:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> meh
[13:13:30] <arschmitz> seems kinda crazy to do to me though
[13:13:30] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> To be honest, it seems silly to render a full widget then go through the widget's API to add a class.
[13:14:18] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i just wanted a second oppinion 
[13:14:27] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Nono. We're talking about at runtime.
[13:14:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Not upon initial load.
[13:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Right, I think it's silly.
[13:14:54] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah its probably not something that will really come up
[13:15:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're probably right.
[13:15:14] <arschmitz> and if a lot of people complain we can always change it
[13:15:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not easily.
[13:15:30] <arschmitz> but id be suprised if we ever see a ticket on it
[13:15:37] <arschmitz> as easy as we could implement it now
[13:15:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... DOM transactions anyone?
[13:16:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can't believe how nice it would be to have those.
[13:16:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Both for perf and for undo-ability.
[13:17:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It'd be like git for DOM.
[13:18:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: anyway thanks for confirming that its crazy to do that
[13:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:23:55] <_|Nix|_> I guess we can specify that _destroy() restores the DOM structure rather than /everything/
[13:24:27] <_|Nix|_> ... although it does remove some classes - like the ui-<widgetname> class.
[13:24:55] <_|Nix|_> But removing option-based classes is indeed crazy.
[13:25:31] <_|Nix|_> So, it brings the DOM "reasonable" close to its initial state ...
[13:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> All you need to document is that if you use the enhanced option, _destroy() doesn't touch the markup.
