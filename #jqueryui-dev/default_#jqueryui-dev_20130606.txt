[05:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> `tell Dave_Stein If you're going to play with multi-touch, do it with Pointer Events, not Touch Events.
[05:25:53] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell Dave_Stein about that.
[07:45:59] <scott_gonzalez_> 75 releases, 42 stable: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/5721859
[07:53:24] <tj_vantoll> Interesting. Happen to have the UI usage stats you had in your talk in Toronto? % of sites in the top 1 million or whatever.
[07:55:30] <scott_gonzalez_> http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery-UI
[07:56:49] <tj_vantoll> Excellent thanks. Interesting that there's a fairly substantial bump up in the middle of April.
[07:57:28] <scott_gonzalez_> Yeah, it's possible that UI got added to some project that lots of sites use.
[07:57:55] <tj_vantoll> Did it land in Drupal yet?
[07:58:37] <scott_gonzalez_> Oh man, they're *still* working on the patch to add autocomplete.
[07:58:46] <scott_gonzalez_> They have such a crazy long dev cycle.
[08:00:00] <scott_gonzalez_> https://drupal.org/node/675446
[08:00:05] <scott_gonzalez_> Opened January 6, 2010
[08:02:01] <tj_vantoll> Wow 171 comments.
[08:02:17] <scott_gonzalez_> Yeah, their issues are crazy.
[08:02:29] <scott_gonzalez_> Here's the one for using dialog: https://drupal.org/node/1667742
[08:02:32] <scott_gonzalez_> 140 comments
[08:02:45] <scott_gonzalez_> Since July 1, 2012
[08:03:48] <scott_gonzalez_> They took down the timeline image from https://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core
[08:04:09] <scott_gonzalez_> Which I think means D8 is shipping way later than expected.
[08:04:30] <scott_gonzalez_> I'm pretty sure they were supposed to go into code freeze months ago.
[08:04:39] <scott_gonzalez_> And they're still in active development as far as I can tell.
[08:05:53] <scott_gonzalez_> Yup, found an old email that said D8 code freeze was Feb 1.
[08:09:52] <tj_vantoll> Huh, yeah they're careful not to give out any sort of specifics. It looks like the dialog ticket is closed at least https://drupal.org/node/1175830.
[08:24:36] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez_: glad we modified our roadmap / rushed a bit for them :/
[08:44:19] <scott_gonzalez_> kborchers: Meh. We didn't actually change anything other than how quickly 1.10 came out.
[08:45:03] <scott_gonzalez_> tj_vantoll: Oh no, that's just an upgrade of UI.
[08:45:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez_: i thought we pushed some things to 1.11 as well (though that probably would have happened anyways)
[08:45:08] <scott_gonzalez_> They were already using sortable in the admin UI.
[08:45:20] <scott_gonzalez_> kborchers: We just split 1.10 into 1.10 and 1.11.
[08:45:24] <kborchers> oh right
[08:45:31] <scott_gonzalez_> Dialog was already the next widget on the roadmap.
[08:45:40] <tj_vantoll> ah
