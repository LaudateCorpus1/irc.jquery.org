[05:16:11] <mikesherov> we should honestly just remove that datepicker eval
[05:16:24] <mikesherov> it was one of two remaining JSHint "wat?"'s

[05:22:51] <mikesherov> I've cleaned up all of the files, loopfunc on sortable is the only thing left
[05:23:36] <mikesherov> and I didn't touch that because theoretically, I'd want to write a test when removing the loop func stuff, but it's in deprecated functionality
[05:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you saw that Anika sent her next PR?
[05:23:44] <mikesherov> yes, I did

[05:26:08] <mikesherov> or should I just CLOSE them
[05:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> They're all for localization?
[05:26:26] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:27:18] <scott_gonzalez> Well, on one hand, we don't *need* CLAs for them, since they're public info.
[05:27:24] <mikesherov> right
[05:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> On the other hand, we want to be able to easily compare the contributor list to the CLA list.
[05:28:04] <mikesherov> right, but what I mean is, I think we should just decide now what to do so these don't linger.
[05:28:37] <mikesherov> I can ask for CLA's and if they don't reply, have you reauthor as they are public info

[05:35:25] <Danwe> I wonder about the right thing to do in event handling when having a widget (A1), which uses other widgets (B1 and B2). So pretend A1 has a function startEditmode(), and so do B1 and B2. All of those widgets should trigger an event when the function is called, but in case of A1 this will be confusing for subscribers to the event since they get it three times, while they can't even know about all the inner events. So what would be the right thing here? 
[05:35:25] <Danwe> A1 catching all events from inner widgets, not propagating them further? Using namespaces, or prefixes? Triggering the event on the Widget object itself in addition?

[05:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone else have issues using GitHub on Chrome?
[05:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> It gets so slow for me.
[05:42:50] <mikesherov> not me
[05:42:54] <mikesherov> nice and fast
[05:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> Danwe: I don't know why this is confusing. The same happens with native DOM events.
[05:49:11] <tj_vantoll> Chrome + GitHub = Fast for me as well
[05:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...the only extension I have is 1Password.
[05:49:54] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm pretty sure it was slow even before that.
[06:11:54] <Danwe> scott_gonzalez: the question is, is there a good reason/use for emulating DOM events for custom widget events then? It seems in many cases it would be more useful if the event were triggered on the $.Widget instance
[06:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, because widgets are just custom elements.
[06:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> They're web components in spec speak.
[06:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> They're part of the DOM.
[06:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> So they should behave like they're part of the DOM.
[06:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> It would be quite crippling to trigger events on the widget instance instead of the element.
[06:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> You'd have a whole new API, one which is known to be confusing to a large portion of jQuery users.
[06:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> You'd lose event delegation.
[06:17:11] <Danwe> So I guess your solution to the problem would be that people registering their events should also always check the target node to be the widget (A1) they know about?
[06:17:14] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.7.x core build #12: FAILURE in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.7.x%20core/12/
[06:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> Danwe: Only insofar as they would for native events.
[06:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is like listening for a click on a div.
[06:20:24] <Danwe> scott_gonzalez: it is still weird though. In native events you never have anything quite like this. There is no concept of a "edit" mode which propagates to sub widgets (child nodes), in native events it always goes from the inner to the outer node. In my case you have one event on the outer node bubbeling all the way up, then two (B1 and B2) on the inner nodes, bubbeling all the way up.
[06:21:11] <Danwe> the native event system might not be designed for stuff like this
[06:21:28] <Danwe> So I wonder whether this is an abuse of the system then
[06:21:43] <Danwe> in case of what I am doing with A1, B1 and B2
[06:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like its something specific to your widgets.
[06:25:23] <Danwe> scott_gonzalez: if a widget is "part of the DOM", then you could see one widget with all of its DOM (sub) structure as one single DOM node? All dom nodes within the widgets are off limits to the outside world?
[06:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> You can, that's sort of the concept of web components.
[06:27:03] <Danwe> If so, then I should catch all events from B1 and B2 in A1 and stop their propagation, because if above is true, then a widget should be "the end of the line" and therefore there shouldn't be any events coming out of sub nodes of the widget.
[06:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> But there is the shadow DOM.
[06:28:01] <Danwe> at least not sub-widget events, native DOM events perhaps.^^
[06:28:41] <Danwe> scott_gonzalez: in jQuery, did you ever think about implementing some "event" or "all" event, which is triggered before any other event is triggered?
[06:29:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what you mean.
[06:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> You mean an event that says an event is about to be triggered?
[06:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> No, that would be crazy.
[06:33:52] <jzaefferer> upvote upvote! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13504409/where-to-find-jquery-ui-tabs-widget-api-document/13586483#13586483
[06:35:24] <Danwe> scott_gonzalez: perhaps crazy, but in the case of my A1, B1, B2 still useful to catch the events in A1 and stop them.
[06:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> If A1 is controlling B1/B2, there's no reason you'd need extra events to manage that.
[06:38:55] <Danwe> sure, A1 would know about all B1 and B2's events and could register to them directly. Would be more code and maintanence work than having the "all" event.
[06:39:48] <Danwe> on the other hand, with the "all" event you probably would want to keep a whitelist of DOM events like mouseover which should still propagate
[06:41:37] <Danwe> or I use event prefixes and won't have the problem in the first place I guess
[06:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> All widgets use event prefixes.
[06:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Not sure what happened, but I redeployed and the quick download is there now.
[06:46:30] <kborchers> hey scott_gonzalez so is this national appendTo move month? Just saw that mike moved to my neck of the woods :)
[06:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, maybe. Joel Glovier is moving too :-P
[06:48:10] <kborchers> heh
[06:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> Though he's only moving a few miles away.
[06:50:57] <Danwe> Than you scott_gonzalez, your insights have been very enlightening, as always :)
[06:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, hopefully you find a solution that makes sense for your specific case.
[06:51:57] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: if you reployed jqueryui.com, where's the deployment notification email? gnarf??
[06:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> Those are probably only sent by puppet.
[06:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing built into grunt to send notifications.
[06:53:03] <jzaefferer> I got notifications for api.jquerymobile.com deployments
[06:53:25] <jzaefferer> also, redeploy meaning you deployed from local to live?
[06:54:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is there an API for exporting the CLA list? Or is even that not possible?
[06:54:44] <jzaefferer> if we can get it as json or even cvs, we can do the search locally
[06:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> I logged into the server and ran `grunt deploy`
[06:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> There's a really shitty API that requires you to be logged in.
[06:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's not something we can automate.
[06:55:43] <jzaefferer> Well, I'd rather use that then checking each author manually?
[06:55:59] <jzaefferer> If it can make the manual verification easier, its still an improvement
[06:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> It won't make it any easier.
[06:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> You need to actually use your browser.
[06:56:35] <jzaefferer> for running `grunt deploy` - what's the server and directory for that?
[06:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> jq02 /usr/local/wordpress-repos
[06:56:54] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[06:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> If the data was public, it'd be possible to automate.
[06:57:44] <scott_gonzalez> But private spreadsheets require the user to actually log in with their browser.
[06:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> So it kills the whole automation process.
[06:57:59] <jzaefferer> I guess that's why I didn't get emails. gnarf set them up three days ago, after the 1.9.2 release. And running `grunt deploy` manually isn't logged.
[06:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:58:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: How about manually downloading the spreadsheet, putting that into the right folder, then running `grunt verify-cla` using that file? Not automated, but avoids having to search for each author
[06:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> So that would likely only show you people who are already in AUTHORS.txt anyway.
[06:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> People are unlikely to sign the CLA before sending their first PR.
[06:59:43] <jzaefferer> Oh right. You want them to sign before merging their first commit.

[08:08:50] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: probably

[08:09:17] <DaveMethvin> or is this happening for places other than -git
[08:09:43] <DaveMethvin> it used to be that .trigger("click") checkboxes had the opposite state of naturally clicked checkboxes

[11:01:52] <rxaviers> or more space?
[11:03:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i would probably go with more space before an hr
[11:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0q201L0d2Z0n ?
[11:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's 30px, which matches the bottom margin.
[11:06:56] <kborchers> i feel like that's probably good enough. just enough to separate them
[11:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:13:03] <agcolom> could they be in a separate box?
[11:13:17] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kborchers ^
[11:13:23] <agcolom> rxaviers: ^
[11:13:24] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, that's def better
[11:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That would require putting the description into a bo.
[11:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> box
[11:14:16] <agcolom> yes... 
[11:14:51] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you have a page up to see what it looks like (a full page)?
[11:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> No, but I have this: http://cl.ly/image/470H42230i3J
[11:16:14] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez, DaveMethvin: at what version was .hover() deprecated? 
[11:16:16] <kswedberg> 1.8?
[11:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, 1.8
[11:16:39] <DaveMethvin> the "hover" event was deprecated but not the .hover() method
[11:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, what?
[11:16:58] <kswedberg> wat?
[11:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> There was a hover EVENT?
[11:17:05] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:17:16] <DaveMethvin> "hover" meant "mouseenter mouseleave"
[11:17:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes, I get a better idea now... still thinking...
[11:17:26] <DaveMethvin> it was, literally, a string substitution
[11:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[11:17:45] <kswedberg> so, how to document that? hmm.
[11:17:53] <DaveMethvin> it'll be in the upgrade guide
[11:18:04] <rxaviers> separate box sounds better
[11:18:06] <DaveMethvin> the only mention of "hover" i know of was in .on()
[11:18:12] <kswedberg> .on('hover', fn)
[11:18:13] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if it's still there
[11:18:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah, noted as deprecated here: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:18:57] <kswedberg> oh yeah, it's in the new docs, too.
[11:19:14] <kswedberg> should we note it in .hover() as well? or is that weird?
[11:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> I had no idea this was ever supported.
[11:19:33] <DaveMethvin> is there a note there already? lemme check
[11:19:35] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: you're the better for it
[11:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think so. This is not as cool as attrFn.
[11:19:59] <DaveMethvin> gaaaaahh
[11:20:10] <DaveMethvin> no mention in .hover()
[11:20:39] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't say anything more
[11:20:55] <DaveMethvin> we can just add to the note in "on" that it's been removed in 1.9?
[11:21:40] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: sounds reasonable.
[11:21:50] <DaveMethvin> at one point we got three dup tickets that said .live("hover", enterFn, leaveFn) didn't work
[11:21:58] <DaveMethvin> people just make up their own apis
[11:22:05] <kswedberg> that's just gross
[11:22:45] <DaveMethvin> so anyway, .hover() isn't dead...yet :D
[11:23:52] <kswedberg> ok, good to know. :)
[11:24:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think that the new style gives the impression that there is something missing at the top. So I think a box with the title overview to start with would be good... The other problem is that the quick links should be in view. If they are below the overview, they may not be in view on certain pages... 
[11:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not the overview, the overview is the description.
[11:25:19] <scott_gonzalez> The description even had a title of Overview before.
[11:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> I removed that when I changed the order because widgets were the only thing that had a title for the description.
[11:26:24] <agcolom> ok, so just the description? 
[11:26:30] <agcolom> (goes 1st)
[11:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> yes, short and long description then QuickNav.
[11:28:42] <rxaviers> Do we still have the black-titled box? Or not anymore?
[11:29:21] <rxaviers> Looking at http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/, it seems very duplicate having an inner-article with <h2>Dialog Widget</h2> inside of a <h1>Dialog Widget</h1> article.
[11:29:36] <agcolom> yes, I'd lose the outer box
[11:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> What black tiled box?
[11:29:55] <rxaviers> article with an h2
[11:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have a suggestion for something else?
[11:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> .dialog() as the title?
[11:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Note what we're working from: http://stage.api.jquery.com/attr/
[11:32:33] <agcolom> otherwise If we keep the outer box, have another inner box for description (just like the one for method/options)
[11:33:11] <agcolom> and there, maybe we could also have a quick link to the quick nav box
[11:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: So you'd want the descripton on http://stage.api.jquery.com/remove/ to be in a box?
[11:34:32] <agcolom> this is hard to discuss online! 
[11:34:48] <rxaviers> yeap
[11:34:52] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: when I look at this one:
[11:34:54] <agcolom> http://cl.ly/image/470H42230i3J
[11:35:27] <rxaviers> scott, about the specific h2 vs. h1 thing above. I think that having .dialog(...) in the h2 would be better than duplicating what we have in h1.
[11:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> So fly over here and we'll discuss in person :-)
[11:35:35] <rxaviers> hehe
[11:35:39] <agcolom> I would put all the things between Description and the quick nav box in a box like the quick nav box
[11:35:53] <agcolom> we need teleportation!
[11:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^
[11:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well how about this:
[11:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> People good at design can do whatever is best.
[11:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's a discussion I'll stay out of :-P
[11:37:11] <kswedberg> hmm. scott_gonzalez : that looks good to me. I don't' think it needs a box, but I'm no designer
[11:37:12] <agcolom> no!!!!!
[11:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> I changed the XSL to do what the issue said to do :-P
[11:37:33] <agcolom> (the no was to scott_gonzalez staying out of this discussion ;) )
[11:37:53] <agcolom> I'm no designer either!
[11:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You DO NOT want me designing.
[11:38:22] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I think this is an improvement over what we had. Maybe create an issue and ping the designers until they respond
[11:38:56] <kswedberg> but deploying as is better than not doing anything
[11:39:13] <rxaviers> yeap, if it counts I think we can break this into more issues
[11:39:59] <rxaviers> the important think is keep improving :)
[11:40:02] <rxaviers> thing*
[11:40:33] <agcolom> ok, once I have a page to play with, I'll try to see if I can do a couple of possible pages... then it may be easier to discuss when we have examples to play with...
[11:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/136
[11:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Can you ping 47m about that?
[11:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: If you pull, you'll have it locally.
[11:41:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: will do.
[11:41:15] <rxaviers> agcolom, I liked your consolidated box idea
[11:41:36] <agcolom> rxaviers: thanks :) 
[11:41:54] <agcolom> btw I found a problem on the learn front page...
[11:43:17] <rworth> scott_gonzalez sure
[11:43:36] <agcolom> best to discuss on #jquery-content I guess for that one... 
[11:52:57] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, thanks for the code review, just finished seeing it. I've replied a few. Some I wait for your answer ok.
[11:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I think I've replied to all of your replies :-)
[11:54:25] <rxaviers> )
[11:54:25] <rxaviers> :)

[12:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8856
[12:33:56] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8856?
[12:34:02] <DaveMethvin> ok
[12:34:53] <DaveMethvin> just a minute, tryna bang on the google site to get a nexus 4
[12:39:44] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15lordt opened pull request #848: Button: Strange space between buttons in IE 7. Fixed #5253 Toolbar demo ... (06master...06bug_5253)  02http://git.io/5T8ClA
[12:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Still fighting with the nexus?
[12:57:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but playing with that case as well
[12:57:38] <DaveMethvin> i have TWO HANDS you know :P
[12:58:03] <agcolom> Can I ask a question about the nexus?
[12:58:09] <DaveMethvin> i can't repro it either scott_gonzalez
[12:58:26] <DaveMethvin> agcolom:  if the question is "can i get one" the answer is probably no
[12:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm gonna close.
[12:58:32] <DaveMethvin> at least for my luck
[12:58:44] <agcolom> no, that's not the question :-) 
[12:58:53] <DaveMethvin> ok, question?
[12:58:55] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:59:01] <agcolom> the question is what do you think about the nexus 7?
[12:59:08] <agcolom> (is it reliable?)
[12:59:11] <DaveMethvin> oh i was getting the nexus 4 phone
[12:59:17] <DaveMethvin> i don't have a nexus 7 tablet
[13:00:07] <DaveMethvin> the google checkout thingy is being slammed, nothing is working
[13:00:11] <agcolom> the reason for asking is people at work want to give a nexus 7 tablet to all students. I think they should give an iPAd to all students but noone listens ! 
[13:00:37] <DaveMethvin> you should see if google will give discounts, you know apple won't
[13:01:03] <agcolom> that's probably the thing. Apple gave us a tiny discount
[13:01:03] <rworth> agcolom I have the nexu 7, I like it
[13:01:35] <agcolom> all the mail of the university is now with Google so maybe they got a good deal...
[13:01:53] <agcolom> rworth: have you had any problems with it? 
[13:02:57] <rworth> nope. My wife has one too. No problems with either. And really nice to get ICS updates as soon as they're out
[13:03:41] <agcolom> rworth: thanks. That's reassuring :-)
[13:04:32] <rworth> ykmb
[13:04:39] <rworth> ykmv
[13:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> stupid metric acronyms
[13:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fairly certain kilometerage isn't a word :-P
[13:06:50] <rworth> haha
[13:07:49] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: it is in French ;-)
[13:10:45] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Thanks
[13:16:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: OMG what happened to stage?
[13:17:11] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[13:18:22] <agcolom> (oh, it's only in FF!)
[13:19:19] <rworth> looks bad in chrome, worse in FF
[13:43:41] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think the culprit is somewhere here: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/df96152fe04ed06b85fb26ba30a9eaaf35941a0c#themes/api.jqueryui.com/style.css
[13:57:17] <agcolom> do the last 2 .quick-nav need to be replaced with #quick-nav?
[14:02:26] <agcolom> then there's also something going on with the quick nav which uses class quick-nav... 
[14:02:53] <agcolom> Safari also has the issue. I didn't get it at first because of the cache...
[14:12:03] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, let's start again, all we need is to change <section class="quick-nav"> to <section id="quick-nav">
[14:14:09] <gnarf> jzaefferer: make sure if you're manually updating a repo to sudo -u jqdeploy grunt deploy :)
[17:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's just because stage isn't using new grunt-jquery-content yet.
[18:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers gnarf mikesherov: I won't be at the meeting tomorrow. I'll be closing on my house :-)
[18:40:03] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: slacking on the meetings!
[18:40:08] <kborchers> oh and congrats :)
[18:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> I know :-/
[18:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[18:40:30] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Congrats
[18:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[18:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> We're super excited.
