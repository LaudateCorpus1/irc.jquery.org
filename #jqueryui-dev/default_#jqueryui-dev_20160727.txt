[11:21:50] <rafajafar> hey guys, I wanted to let you know that the documentation incorrectly lists the "ui-icon-caret-*-*" as "ui-icon-carat-*-*". The word "carat" isn't correct, it's "caret" in the css. http://api.jqueryui.com/theming/icons/
[11:22:20] <rafajafar> not sure who to talk to about that, but I figure someone here can either fix it or file a ticket about it.
