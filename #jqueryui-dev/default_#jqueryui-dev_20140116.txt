[04:26:15] <NiGhTTraX> scott_gonzalez: I found two more bugs in the sortable documentation
[04:27:30] <NiGhTTraX> they seem to come from some weird draggable hacks
[04:28:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've noticed that we're being pretty cavalier with event attaches/detaches in touch.js ... we shouldn't just be doing $( this ).off( "eventname" ), because there may be event listeners on that element for that event which we don't own. We should always keep track of the function we've attached as a handler, and detach that specific function.

[05:44:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats old code we have just been adding fixes to so im not suprised at all
[05:45:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also with the tabbing issue
[05:45:53] <arschmitz> it IS tabbable its the first element that gets tabbed to on the page
[05:46:11] <arschmitz> which is actually the issue it should be tabbed to after the input
[05:48:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait a sec ... when I was testing, I clicked on the input, then hit tab a couple of times and it arrived at the slider widget.
[05:48:28] <arschmitz> exactly you clicked the input
[05:48:35] <arschmitz> dont click anything just hit the tab key
[05:48:42] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[05:49:07] <arschmitz> the flipswitch handle is the first element when you jsut hit the tabkey 
[05:49:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Gotcha, so it's because the tab order is really weird.
[05:49:39] <arschmitz> yes
[05:49:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hold on a sec though ... then how is the span getting the focus?
[05:50:14] <arschmitz> it has tabindex set
[05:50:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It does indeed, but where are you getting the value for it?
[05:51:06] <arschmitz> i think its just setting 1
[05:51:12] <arschmitz> and it should be setting 0
[05:51:19] <arschmitz> changing to 0 fixes the issue
[05:51:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: regardless though we should use the code from slider
[05:51:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I think so ...
[05:51:51] <arschmitz> because it will maintin if some one sets explicitly
[05:51:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[05:52:32] <arschmitz> also the native element is currently still tabbable 
[05:52:39] <arschmitz> and it should have -1 so its not
[05:54:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll take the bug.

[08:07:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: it looks like you changed how it works now you removed the _.without and the sort and reverse calls was this intentional?

[09:26:32] <fnagel> Hey guys, a question regarding datepicker: is it the intended behaviour that setDate method opens the datepicker?
[09:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> no

[09:30:55] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: Mhh, when trying a minimal example it works fine, seems to be a side effect. Sorry for bothering.
[09:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[09:42:40] <fnagel> scott_gonzalez: FYI: it's a problem of datetimepicker. When its available on the site, even if the field is no datetimepicker but a datepicker

[11:41:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, For some CLDR date timezone patterns all I need is timezone offset, very easy. But, for some patterns I need the Oslo map eg. "America/New_York".
[11:41:02] <b-ot> rxaviers: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[11:41:32] <rxaviers> For comparison, dojo does not format those patterns precisely according to CLDR.
[11:41:43] <rxaviers> Anyway, the best way to do that mapping that I found so far is 
[11:41:44] <rxaviers> https://bitbucket.org/pellepim/jstimezonedetect/src/f9e3e30e1e1f53dd27cd0f73eb51a7e7caf7b378/jstz.js?at=default#cl-265
[11:42:09] <rxaviers> If we follow this approach, we'll need to embed that data structure within our library.
[11:42:12] <rxaviers> What do you think?
[11:42:30] <rxaviers> I can't use CLDR data to generate that info on the fly.
[11:42:40] <rxaviers> `read
[11:42:40] <b-ot> rxaviers: From scott_gonzalez, 22h 53m ago: rwaldron pointed me to http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/ECMA-402.pdf re: timezones
[11:43:08] <rxaviers> (beautiful... reading.. thanks)
[11:43:39] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I think that's fine, as long as there's a reliable source to pull the data from.
[11:44:21] <rxaviers> You mean, we should not embed that data withing our code then?
[11:44:36] <rxaviers> But, let user load it (analogous to what we do to CLDR)
[11:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> I meant is there a reliable soruce to get that info from?
[11:47:35] <rxaviers> With CLDR, we have unicode to forward users to. But, with that custom data, I'm afraid not.
[11:47:37] <rxaviers> nope
[11:48:17] <rxaviers> (PS: Mark Davis is one of the names in the ecma spec above)
[11:48:24] <rxaviers> interesting
[11:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Perhaps we should use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database
[11:51:56] <scott_gonzalez> Here's a list of timezones from that: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
[11:58:33] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, IANA http://www.iana.org/time-zones provides it. So, we could rely on IANA. Is that what you mean?
[11:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds good to me.
[11:59:24] <rxaviers> I think it could work (and it would be the best approach indeed). First, I need to check if, using this list, we can compile the same information needed for the algorithm above.
[11:59:50] <rxaviers> Second, what format this list if distributed.. I guess it's csv only
[12:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, should be easy to script the converstion.
[12:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> You could have another project like cldr.js :-P
[12:01:07] <rxaviers> oh no. hehe
[12:01:32] <rxaviers> but, yeap thanks I will check the possibilities in this direction.
[12:01:32] <rxaviers> ;)
[12:45:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought we were going to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262 because it's a regression. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6946 fixes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6262, but in the meeting doc it says it has to wait until 1.5.0. So, what's the final word?
[12:48:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes we are going to fix 6262 for 1.4.1
[12:48:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think I was a bit confused about which PR fixes what issue
[12:49:12] <gseguin> arschmitz: tests are passing for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6922
[12:50:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just removed that note
[12:51:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: just made one really trivial comment
[12:51:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was looking at issue 6925 instead of 6262
[12:51:27] <gseguin> darn! 
[12:51:33] <gseguin> ok fixing

[13:21:44] <agcolom> what's the situation now? Should _|Nix|_ land his PR (https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/pull/215) or can I do it? 
[13:23:12] <arschmitz> agcolom: either is fine i think thats a trivial change
[13:23:17] <arschmitz> and i dont think _|Nix|_ will mind
[13:24:08] <agcolom> I've not had that case yet, so I don't know... 
[13:24:27] <agcolom> There's no rush anyway, we can wait tomorrow...
[13:25:17] <agcolom> because there doesn't seem to be record in github when I land my PR, so I guess that should keep the author as the author?
[13:25:25] <agcolom> (in the activity log)
[13:26:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: yup landing a pr does not change the author
[13:26:57] <arschmitz> because for people without commit access we always land their prs for them
[13:27:27] <arschmitz> so unless its like a big change or feature and you want to let them land it it really does not matter
