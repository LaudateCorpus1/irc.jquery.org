[04:40:54] <speedy> yo guys, just one note for documentation improvement
[04:42:20] <speedy> you should specify in the docs that one should first insert element into DOM and only after that call jqueryUI widget creation and other fns
[04:43:18] <speedy> (jqueryUI behaves weirdly when element is not inside DOM - maybe there should be a check on each widget init if the element IS in DOM)
[04:43:53] <speedy> btw. i'm applying jQueryUI to dynamically created elements, and there's where I stumbled upon this
[06:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell speedy Please provide examples of where this is broken. Many widgets allow initialization outside of the DOM
[06:13:03] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.

[06:22:25] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Update package.json to contain more information. - Scott González
[06:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: This is what I'm thinking about for generating manifest files during a release: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/manly-fists
[06:24:34] <rworth> icanhaz trailing slashes on urls?
[06:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[06:25:35] <rworth> consistency
[06:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> With what?
[06:26:39] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/a35635ddf4a836ed24dbb4346e1da0812b143504
[06:26:40] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on web-base-template by Karl Swedberg (1w, 2d ago): Add trailing slash for default permalink_structure. Add (commented) permalink_structure for blog-jquery-com
[06:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:28:09] <kswedberg> rworth: we should check with nacin|off about this. I thought there was a reason we went back to slashless urls.
[06:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> I had thought we chose slashless as well, but I couldn't find anything to back that up.
[06:28:56] <rworth> kswedberg he's on that discussion "It's just a matter of what you'd want and on what sites. Perhaps open an issue to look over the existing sites and see what each should be?"
[06:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: FTR, The URLs you list aren't accurate, at least not today.
[06:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquery.org/team (no slash)
[06:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> And jquery.com links to jquery.com/download, but then redirects to jquery.com/download/
[06:30:49] <rworth> ummm when I visit http://jquery.org/team (no slash) I get redirected to http://jquery.org/team/ (slash)
[06:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> I do not

[06:31:29] <rworth> weird
[06:31:29] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Update package.json to contain more information.
[06:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg ajpiano: We've never really liked the description of jQuery UI. Any thoughts on how to improve it? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/package.json#L4
[06:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> So, going back to what I said, we actually have no consistency at all today.
[06:34:10] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I'll take a look at that later today.
[06:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> Because nobody hand writes URLs with slashes.
[06:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> So most of our actual links don't contain the trailing slash.
[06:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, whatever we're doing, I'll get the URLs in the manifests to match.
[06:41:09] <rworth> fixed jquery.com/download (it used to be a mediawiki url, when it was switched, the trailing slash was missed). I agree that we're not 100% consistenct but it looks to me we've always been consistent with WordPress sites, those've been the majority of our sites in the past and will be more-so in the future
[06:41:17] <rworth> while mediawiki is still around, I see no reason to change it's urls
[06:41:23] <rworth> its
[06:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: We've only been consistent with WordPress if the links are auto-generated (which most are)
[06:42:16] <rworth> scott_gonzalez which means that of all the urls out on the internet with jquery in the domain name, a majority of them have a trailing slash
[06:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> rworth DaveMethvin: Thoughts on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/685?
[06:43:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by eXtreme (2d, 29m ago): Update AUTHORS.txt
[06:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> Even Isaac thinks it's silly :-P
[06:45:32] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i think we talked about getting the real name of each contributor, is that what should go in the authors file?
[06:45:32] <bot-t> (1 hour 41 mins ago) <jaubourg> tell DaveMethvin http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/#comment-532031 OMG YOU WONT SLEEP EVER!!!!111
[06:45:46] <DaveMethvin> haha
[06:46:00] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, we but we track email address too so it's easy to contact an author.
[06:46:29] <DaveMethvin> that could be elsewhere if we wanted, and if someone wanted to go by their handle rather than real name we should use that
[06:46:40] <DaveMethvin> but it really depends on what the purpose of authors.txt is
[06:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> I see the purpose as a public record of who has contributed to the project and has partial copyright ownership.
[06:47:54] <rworth> confirm. what if two people have the same real name? email seems the accepted unique identifier
[06:47:57] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I agree with DaveMethvin. as silly as it is to think it'll have any effect, we should respect how a contributor wishes for personal information to be (or not to be) displayed
[06:49:06] <kswedberg> rworth: they can't have the same github username, can they?
[06:49:09] <rworth> ok, I kinda agree with that too. I mean it's silly, and he supposedly realizes it is. But call it an exception and don't adopt a rule "we only list name to protect people's privacy and security"
[06:49:33] <DaveMethvin> his particular objection (mah email iz exposed to googles!) is funny because his home page has his email in plain text and an explicit <meta name="robots" content="follow,index"/>
[06:49:39] <rworth> kswedberg I'd be fine if we used github username to uniquely identify people
[06:49:51] <DaveMethvin> and we can keep the other contact info elsewhere
[06:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want to use GitHub user names.
[06:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> They're meaningless.
[06:50:08] <DaveMethvin> and "John Smith" isn't?
[06:50:10] <DaveMethvin> :D
[06:50:27] <kswedberg> how about John Smith (jsmith)
[06:50:33] <rworth> GitHub usernames are meaningful as long as GitHub is the only way we accept code contributions
[06:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: It is not.
[06:50:58] <rworth> you talking about patches via trac?
[06:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> In the past we've used SVN. We can accept patches via Trac today. Who knows what we might use in the future.
[06:51:12] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I didn't know that. ok.
[06:51:33] <DaveMethvin> well let's not get into that and figure out how we want to id contributors
[06:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> Tying authorship info to a specific hosting company for a specific source control system seems really silly.
[06:52:00] <DaveMethvin> okay, so scott we know what we don't want to do
[06:52:02] <rworth> that is a distinct advantage to email addresses
[06:52:04] <DaveMethvin> what do we want to do
[06:52:23] <kswedberg> but having authorship be a combination of Real Name + username wouldn't be so hard.
[06:52:29] <DaveMethvin> i do see why some people may not want an email exposed
[06:52:35] <DaveMethvin> i gave up on that long ago
[06:52:46] <rworth> do we have to do anything as a rule? We're already doing something pretty sane. Just remove this guys email address and stash it in a private file somewhere in case we ever want to email him someday
[06:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's silly. His email address is even in the commit.
[06:52:53] <DaveMethvin> right
[06:53:08] <DaveMethvin> i agree this case is silly
[06:53:09] <DaveMethvin> but
[06:53:12] <rworth> we already called him silly on the pull request. Just give in and move on
[06:53:19] <DaveMethvin> as a general policy what does authorst.txt look like?
[06:53:21] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: that's right, but the next guy's request for the same might not be as silly
[06:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> full name <email>
[06:53:36] <kswedberg> we should at least allow for the except
[06:53:39] <kswedberg> *exception
[06:54:56] <DaveMethvin> if we just need to know the legal real name of the contributor, the email isn't relevant to the public document anyway
[06:55:06] <DaveMethvin> we can keep a separate contact list
[06:55:57] <rworth> except we don't really want to maintain a separate list. So why not just have a document with the email address of the one exception
[06:56:10] <rworth> then put something like <unlisted-1> next to his name
[06:56:16] <rworth> where 1 is the line number in that file
[06:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want fake info in there.
[06:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> We can swap his email for his site.
[06:56:45] <rworth> ok
[06:56:49] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't want to swap his email for a placeholder.
[06:56:56] <rworth> so we just require a url
[06:57:02] <DaveMethvin> site is fine ... i'm just looking at other people's author.txt
[06:57:03] <rworth> and our preference is an email
[06:57:05] <kswedberg> that seems reasonable
[06:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: The reason we don't use site is because it's not available in Git.
[06:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> The git history should be the canonical data source.
[06:57:39] <scott_gonzalez> Which should contain full name + email.
[06:57:57] <DaveMethvin> http://drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!jquery_update!replace!ui!AUTHORS.txt/7
[06:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> AUTHORS.txt is generated from the git log.
[06:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's old and totally wrong, which was part of the problem that I was fixing.
[06:58:28] <DaveMethvin> http://code.google.com/p/cpachecker/source/browse/trunk/Authors.txt
[06:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/62842be5b889055fda9a6f8017205a7828ed2c52
[06:58:43] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Scott González (1m, 3w ago): Updated authors list.
[06:59:11] <DaveMethvin> http://trac.imagemagick.org/browser/ImageMagick/trunk/AUTHORS.txt
[06:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/AUTHORS :-)
[06:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa. ImageMagick is crazy.
[06:59:57] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/zerok/django-flatblocks/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt
[07:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> So it's worth noting that the lists you're finding are hand generated.
[07:00:42] <DaveMethvin> well the key takeaway is that there is no consistency across projects on this
[07:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> Node and jQuery UI are not.
[07:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but there's also a question of whether they have correct copyright info.
[07:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/zerok/django-flatblocks/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
[07:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> Do you think all of the people listed as contributors actually turned over their rights?
[07:01:48] <DaveMethvin> well if we are any example .... :D
[07:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> Exactly, this is an attempt to keep correct records.
[07:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> In the past we've lied like crazy about who owns the copyright and who the authors were.
[07:02:24] <DaveMethvin> that's why i asked about the legal angle
[07:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's REALLY bad.
[07:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> I asked the question about copyright assignment several times during CLA discussions and never got a response from anyone.
[07:02:52] <DaveMethvin> so the important thing is to get the real name of the contributor
[07:03:01] <DaveMethvin> as i understand it?
[07:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, and we should do due diligence to retain contact info.
[07:03:28] <DaveMethvin> the authors.txt files that others have sometimes don't have any contact info there
[07:03:31] <scott_gonzalez> We can swap his email for his site.
[07:03:36] <rworth> then are we going to collect employer info as well?
[07:03:44] <rworth> as many authors files show, that's a big part of CLA
[07:03:49] <DaveMethvin> oh, in case the employer claims ... yeah
[07:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Clearly most projects don't know what they're doing with legal issues.
[07:03:58] <rworth> because any work they do while in their employ is work for hire
[07:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: We will collect that info with the CLA.
[07:04:29] <scott_gonzalez> Which we will try to apply retroactively to everyone.
[07:04:37] <DaveMethvin> well the author represents to us that they have rights to the work as well
[07:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> But that's really up to them to actually complete the form when we send it to them.
[07:04:50] <DaveMethvin> they may not, but that's not something we can vet
[07:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> Going forward we won't accept any contributions without a CLA.
[07:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: correct
[07:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> We just have to do due diligence here.
[07:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't protect us 100% if they lie, but it gives us a better legal standing if we get sued.
[07:05:55] <DaveMethvin> just thinking, when would we refer to authors.txt to get contact info?
[07:06:12] <DaveMethvin> the git log has it if we need to ask about a specific commit
[07:06:24] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we'll certainly refer to it whenw e put the CLA in place and need to contact the hundreds of past contributors :-)
[07:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: That's not actually true.
[07:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> People don't configure git properly.
[07:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> Many people don't have proper email addresses in the logs.
[07:06:57] <scott_gonzalez> I had to track down several people.
[07:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> Some were quite hard to find actually.
[07:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> I do require proper info in git for all commits now though.
[07:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> If someone doesn't get the info stored properly, I will ask them for it and then set it with --author="..." when I land the PR.
[07:08:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, well this is starting to feel like bikeshedding to me so I'll be happy to say we use email unless they complain and then we go website. Agreed?
[07:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> +1
[07:08:42] <rworth> +1
[07:09:05] <DaveMethvin> obtw scott_gonzalez can i borrow your scripts for grabbing the author info?
[07:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yup, it's in our gruntfile.
[07:09:21] <DaveMethvin> cool
[07:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> You'll probably need to do a lot of triage the first time.
[07:09:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah i suspect i will
[07:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> The way I use it is I run `grunt authors` then just copy/paste the last few names.
[07:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> Since I know the data at the top will be busted.
[07:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> But I already have the correct data from the top in AUTHORS.txt.
[07:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> You'll also want to go through the SVN history...
[07:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> At least for UI the SVN history was pretty easy.
[07:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> We didn't have too many contributors, and the ones that we did have were pretty well known.
[07:11:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i haven't looked back that far for ages
[07:11:32] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno
[07:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know if you need any help.
[07:12:02] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[07:12:27] <timmywil> did we give anymore thought to signing dojo's CLA as an organization?
[07:12:55] <timmywil> I signed it as an individual cause slex pointed out Sizzle is a dojo project
[07:13:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: in that case it seems like all the sizzle contribs should sign that?
[07:14:28] <DaveMethvin> but then i guess sizzle contribs wouldn't sign ours? seems strange since it's in our project
[07:14:54] <timmywil> idk, might be nice if there was just one thing to sign
[07:15:11] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/O5Jf8w
[07:15:11] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Update AUTHORS.txt. - Scott González
[07:15:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah, like "i hereby sign my life away"
[07:15:34] <timmywil> my point is working with dojo on the CLA may not be a bad idea
[07:15:54] <timmywil> they have experience with it as well
[07:16:01] <rworth> can we talk with dojo about moving sizzle to jQuery, once we have a proper CLA?
[07:16:21] <timmywil> that's probably possible
[07:16:34] <timmywil> they never touch it anymore
[07:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Can we drop the tri-license from SIzzle? :-D
[07:16:48] <rworth> can we drop the dual-license from jQuery? :-D
[07:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: I asked DaveMethvin about that the other day. No response :-P
[07:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> I swear we discussed and agreed on it a few weeks ago.
[07:17:28] <DaveMethvin> hey what do i look like, a lawyer? :)
[07:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> MIT can be relicensed as GPL.
[07:17:54] <DaveMethvin> it seems like we can just choose one license, the least restrictive, yeah
[07:18:04] <timmywil> what was that wtf license called?
[07:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> WTFPL
[07:18:20] <DaveMethvin> that's the way i feel about it
[07:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> It can be held up in court.
[07:18:27] <rworth> except MIT is fine
[07:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> But we probably shouldn't use it.
[07:18:38] <rworth> I wouldn't support it
[07:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> ISC!
[07:18:45] <rworth> oh boy
[07:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[07:18:51] <rworth> now you got scott_gonzalez going...
[07:18:54] <DaveMethvin> take my code and leave me the hell alone!
[07:19:04] <DaveMethvin> what's that license called?
[07:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> ISC is AWESOME
[07:19:08] <rworth> except when you want to help improve it!
[07:19:17] <timmywil> it's open source, seems like if there are legal issues, we didn't license it right
[07:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> hahaha
[07:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Do you know how many open source licenses there are?
[07:20:28] <timmywil> inorite, like even the licenses are open source
[07:21:07] <DaveMethvin> and some are like diseases, they're viral, or venus flytrap, or tarpaper, or whatever
[07:21:13] <rworth> haha
[07:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: LIES!
[07:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> GPL is itself non-modifiable
[07:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> "Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed."
[07:22:06] <timmywil> i know, i was exaggerating
[07:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, heh. Well, some actually are.
[07:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even know what this means: "“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks."
[07:23:22] <scott_gonzalez> That's like "All laws apply, regardless of what they are" :-P
[07:23:42] <DaveMethvin> i wore a semiconductor mask last halloween, scared a lot of electrical engineers with that one
[07:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:24:11] <timmywil> honestly, I don't care much about licensing, as long as people can use the code paying for it or jumping through hoops, I'm happy.
[07:24:18] <timmywil> without*
[07:24:21] <timmywil> heh
[07:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Nice slip :-)
[07:25:15] <timmywil> woooooops
[07:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just use MIT (or if you're brave ISC, or if you're silly WTFPL)
[07:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> Just don't use Public Domain.
[07:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose WTFPL is essentially what people want when they say Public Domain.
[07:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's sad that we live in a world where software patents are legal but public domain doesn't exist globally :-/
[07:27:27] <rworth> It's sad we live in a world where software patents

[07:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> Now whenever I run `grunt authors` I just grab the most recent names.
[07:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which should always be valid now since I verify data before landing PRs.
[07:42:30] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:42:45] <DaveMethvin> damn you, past, why can't i change you?
[07:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:43:10] <DaveMethvin> pretty messy, and interesting to see that people got their emails wrong and fixed them
[07:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yup. That's a pretty common mistake when people first start using git.
[07:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> It's not until they see a log and notice the default data that they even realize there's info to configure.
[07:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> That definitely happened to me when I first started using git.
[07:48:21] <DaveMethvin> what, you mean i'm not <dave@localhost>? I most certainly am!
[07:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:48:37] <DaveMethvin> the commits are coming from INSIDE THE COMPUTER
[07:51:39] <timmywil> lol
[08:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: profiles.jquery.org or profiles.jquery.com?
[08:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> Also, is that going to be a private or public repo?
[08:14:53] <rworth> profiles.jquery.org
[08:15:17] <rworth> could be a public repo but a private db?
[08:15:34] <scott_gonzalez>  sure
[08:15:41] <rworth> want to mazimize the ability of people to help us develop and test federated login, etc.
[08:54:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hey
[08:54:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: re: color
[08:54:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i kinda wanna make a build process that jams those two together as well
[08:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:54:56] <gnarf> but i like the idea of reducing down to the "simple colors"
[08:55:04] <gnarf> in the core plugin
[08:55:21] <gnarf> how do you feel about that one?
[08:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll probably just pull in the core into UI for now.
[08:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> Eventually we won't have it shoved into effects core.
[08:55:41] <gnarf> it wont have all the same colors as it used to
[08:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> And it'll just be listed in the download builder as another option.
[08:55:43] <gnarf> just FYI
[08:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I know.
[08:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> At that point, we'll have both files available in the download builder.
[08:56:05] <gnarf> cool
[08:56:43] <gnarf> also - why do people (myself included) insist on using their own style when submitting pulls even though its obvious everything around it uses a different style? :)
[08:59:42] <scott_gonzalez> People are lazy
[09:19:14] <gnarf> so um
[09:19:26] <gnarf> I'm having trouble figuring out how to handle this second file in grunt now
[09:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> For what?
[09:21:43] <gnarf> well, I got it actually minifying
[09:21:57] <gnarf> but it seems the "compare size" plugin only expects 2 files :/
[09:22:00] <gnarf> also
[09:22:12] <gnarf> thinking about how to handle the "with names" version
[09:22:23] <gnarf> cuz just to same some asshole some time
[09:22:44] <gnarf> i wouldn't mind distributing a color + color.svg-names package
[09:23:19] <gnarf> also - the minified banner on the svg-names is the same, i'd like to add that its the svg-names plugin to color
[09:25:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: got a minute to walk me through this concat / fixing this banner issue?
[09:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Sure, we have a somewhat complex setup in UI.
[09:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> We should see if we can abstract it.
[09:26:42] <scott_gonzalez> But to start we can just get it working in color :-)
[09:50:58] <gnarf> so we seem to use -git
[09:51:03] <gnarf> for our file names
[09:51:05] <gnarf> but like
[09:51:09] <gnarf> jquery.color-git.js ?
[09:51:14] <gnarf> vs jquery.color.git.js
[09:51:18] <gnarf> or
[09:51:25] <gnarf> jquery.color.plus-names-git.js
[09:51:31] <gnarf> vs jquery.color.plus-names.git.js
[09:51:40] <gnarf> the former is more our current standard
[10:02:05] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-git.js
