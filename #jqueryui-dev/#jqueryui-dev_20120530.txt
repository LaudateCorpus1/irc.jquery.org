[05:02:00] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tabs: Properly remove generated aria-controls attributes on destroy. - Scott González
[05:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ^
[05:03:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ah, in case they had aria-controls in the original markup?
[05:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:04:48] <kborchers> i guess i probably need to change that for menu too
[05:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably less likely to happen for menu.
[05:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's part of the tabs API.
[05:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> You can associate a tab with a specific panel if you want.
[05:06:09] <kborchers> yeah, ok that makes sense
[05:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> <li aria-controls="i-really-care-where-this-ends-up"><a href="whatever">...
[05:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> I actually fixed tabs last night, but didn't have an Intenet connection.
[05:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> Then forgot to push when I got home :-/
[05:07:14] <kborchers> \o/ duplicated effort :P

[05:08:25] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Menu tests: Anchor the regex for aria-activedescendant check. - Scott González
[05:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> This change looks nice :-) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/d44f3d079e1a5976333afe56d104d03ba00a901b
[05:08:55] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by kborchers (9h, 54m ago): Menu: Use new uniqueId and removeUniqueId methods for generating id's on menus and menu items and for removing those id's during destroy. Also, properly remove the aria-disabled attribute during destroy.
[05:09:09] <scott_gonzalez> The new code is more straight-forward, which is what I was hoping for.
[05:09:25] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: agreed, i like the new way much better
[05:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> I really wish GitHub provided an RSS feed that included diffs.
[05:10:31] <kborchers> that would be nice
[05:25:46] <jzaefferer> For some reason I did not expect that it would end up as $.fn.uniqueId
[05:25:55] <jzaefferer> that is looking pretty good :-)

[05:33:43] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tabs: Properly remove generated aria-controls attributes on destroy.
[05:34:46] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do we have any idea what is taking those tests so long to run that jenkins hits 30 minutes and gives up?
[05:34:56] <kborchers> browserstack issue i assume
[05:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> TestSwarm is broken.
[05:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> And BrowserStack was swamped with workers for a while.
[05:35:41] <kborchers> double whammy ... nice
[05:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a query that takes ~40 seconds to run in TestSwarm.
[05:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> So that's killing us.
[05:35:50] <kborchers> ouch
[05:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> krinkle is looking into it.
[05:36:06] <kborchers> cool
[05:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> We have no idea why it's taking so long.
[05:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's just an insert into a relatively small table.
[05:36:54] <kborchers> weird

[08:48:44] <jzaefferer> UI meeting in 12 minutes!!
[08:49:13] <kborchers> jzaefferer: is that a reminder for scott_gonzalez :P
[08:49:14] <jzaefferer> btw. last job is all green: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/191
[08:49:30] <jzaefferer> kborchers: mostly for myself /o\
[08:49:33] <kborchers> heh
[09:30:50] <jzaefferer> kborchers: To start, let's just document all internal API methods (_bind etc) as methods in widget.xml
[09:31:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is themeroller in a repo or is that a whole different beast? wouldn't mind taking a look to see what if anything needs to change to get progressbar in 1.9
[09:31:12] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do we have a spec for that on the wiki? Afaik we don't
[09:31:21] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok
[09:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> No specs for internals on the wiki.
[09:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It's in SVN :-(
[09:31:50] <kborchers> doh
[09:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> Not really sure how this will work with the new site though.
[09:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to rewrite ThemeRoller.
[09:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> and Download Builder.
[09:33:42] <jzaefferer> kborchers: So could you go through jquery.ui.widget.js, spec all methods on the wiki?
[09:33:50] <jzaefferer> We can start there, then write xml docs based on that
[09:34:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer: sure. anything similar i should follow as far as style, etc.
[09:34:53] <jzaefferer> Look at the accordion spec
[09:35:01] <jzaefferer> That's the model for now
[09:35:22] <kborchers> jzaefferer: ok, sounds good. i'll dig into that tonight and then you can tear it apart tomorrow :)
[09:35:24] <jzaefferer> And if you notice an issue with the model - that's a feature, not a bug
[09:35:31] <jzaefferer> Cool, thanks
[09:36:02] <jzaefferer> Related to "tonight", anyone here into Diablo3? gnarf maybe?
[09:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's the roadmap for jquery-color 2.0?
[09:39:45] <jzaefferer> gnarf scott_gonzalez: also grunt updates!
[09:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> GRUNT
[09:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> what updates?
[09:40:18] <scott_gonzalez> grunt for color?
[09:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> or what 0.4.0 released?
[09:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> s/what/was/
[09:40:41] <jzaefferer> color to use grunt
[09:40:51] <gnarf> jzaefferer: gnarf@gnarf.net is my battle net
[09:40:59] <gnarf> so - jquery-color
[09:41:09] <gnarf> I have a tweak I still want to make to it
[09:41:19] <gnarf> that and I need to figure out grunt
[09:41:27] <gnarf> unless someone else wants to take care of that for me
[09:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer or I can do grunt for you
[09:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/issues/19 can be closed.
[09:41:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #19 on jquery-color (infusion; 10m, 4w ago): Merge the new Color Plugin with xColor
[09:41:58] <gnarf> it would be appreciated
[09:42:00] <gnarf> it can be
[09:42:22] <gnarf> sadly, the last thing I want to do to it changes the internal storage a bit
[09:42:31] <gnarf> will need a day or so
[09:42:41] <gnarf> but i figure websites are higher prio for my time right now
[09:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[09:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just a bit anxious to get jquery-color into UI
[09:44:36] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i have to restart the discussion with chad killingsworth on closure, i'll be replying on the bugs-team thread
[09:44:43] <DaveMethvin> what is UI's position on CCAO?
[09:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> no way
[09:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:45:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah i didn't want to misrepresent it
[09:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> CCAO is insane
[09:45:14] <DaveMethvin> "not only no, but HELL NO"
[09:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> c
[09:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> oh wait, that's not emphatic enough
[09:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> ccc
[09:46:05] <DaveMethvin> ok well that helps probably
[09:46:21] <DaveMethvin>  b/c i really do want to try and get something that people can experiment with
[09:46:28] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think it's practical
[09:46:42] <DaveMethvin> so i want to make sure we TRY so everyone else can see how impractical it is
[09:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> CCAO is not practical at all.
[09:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> And I can guarantee that it will get out-of-date very fast.
[09:48:57] <scott_gonzalez> I guess if there was CCAO support, we'd have to run TestSwarm against the output.
[09:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only way we've avoid regressions.
[11:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Can you or Scott weigh in on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/619#issuecomment-4814007 ?
[11:13:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by kborchers (2m, 3d ago): Progressbar: Add ability to set value: false for an indeterminate progressbar. Fixes #7624 - Progressbar: Support value: false for indeterminate progressbar

[12:04:21] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/tabs-aria] Merge branch 'master' into tabs-aria - Scott González
[12:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Do you know if you're relying on _bind() not running handlers based on ui-state-disabled class?
[12:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> For menu
[13:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: ping
[13:29:52] <phpkiddy123> $(document).ready(function(){
[13:29:52] <phpkiddy123>   $('img#captchaimage').die().live('click', function(){
[13:29:52] <phpkiddy123>     $(this).attr('src', '/captcha.php');
[13:29:52] <phpkiddy123>   });
[13:29:52] <phpkiddy123> });
[13:30:03] <phpkiddy123> the above code does not work in firefox
[13:30:41] <kborchers> phpkiddy123: support is in #jquery
[13:30:47] <phpkiddy123> if i change the src attribute's extension from .php to an image format's extension like .jpg or .png, it works in firefox, but does not work in firefox with the .php extension
[13:31:35] <phpkiddy123> I see now, thanks,
[13:31:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i believe i am relying on that but would have to double-check
[13:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a problem in tabs where I want to react to some events.
[13:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely useful having the check (which is why I added it), but it makes it impossible to use _bind() in some situations.
[13:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather have the code duplication than not use ._bind() in some places.
[13:34:36] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe opt-in to the class check?
[13:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> this._bind( element, true, handlers )
[13:34:53] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: hmmm, i may not actually be relying on it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js#L45
[13:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> It also only makes sense when specifying an element.
[13:35:16] <kborchers> i am relying on it for other events though it looks like
[13:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> Would it be easy for you to test all cases if we turned it off?
[13:36:36] <kborchers> i would imagine my unit tests would catch most of them
[13:36:59] <kborchers> i should be testing disabled items and if not, should add it
[13:37:03] <kborchers> :)
[13:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can you disable it and do a quick test?
[13:37:58] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: but i can almost guarantee that without the class check the mouseenter/mouseleave (opening sub-menus) will fire
[13:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> line 360 in jquery.ui.widget.js
[13:38:18] <kborchers> because i am not otherwise checking if they are disabled
[13:38:29] <kborchers> i'll do a quick test. one sec
[13:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> damnit. I updated Chrome to a known bad version to verify a bug earlier.
[13:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> Now I can't do development on pages that use floats. :-(
[13:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sitting here wondering why a page that worked this morning is now totally hosed.
[13:40:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yep, disabled items fire events now :(
[13:40:27] <kborchers> i'm seeing disabled sub-menus on mouseenter
[13:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> How many handlers need the check?
[13:41:12] <kborchers> well, only tested in chrome but looks like that line i linked earlier still prevents click
[13:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it doesn't only make sense when elements are passed, because of delegation...
[13:41:59] <kborchers> looks like maybe 7 or 8 handlers
[13:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> If we add a flag do you think it should be opt in or out for the class check?
[13:43:08] <kborchers> hmm, i would say out
[13:43:21] <kborchers> probably more places that want to not handle if disabled than do
[13:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I think too.
[13:44:47] <kborchers> gotta head out to pick up my son. i'll be online later tonight and can update menu to use that if you decide to implement it
[13:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...maybe I won't need this.
[13:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> You're successfully ignoring clicks on disabled menus.
[13:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> Does that work in IE?
[17:58:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[22:08:39] <kborchers> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez so i was going to do some of that widget doc but was a little confused so figured i would wait. there was mention of docing in the wiki and also docing in widget.xml so wasn't sure where. also, the wiki has a widget page but seems more general and not specific to just widget.js
[22:09:05] <kborchers> just wanted to chat before working on it. headed to bed but we can chat tomorrow or today or what ever it is now
