[05:18:33] <arschmitz> Changsuk: Hi not sure if you still around
[05:20:27] <arschmitz> Changsuk: _|Nix|_ is on vacation for the next week but im happy to help with anything i can
[05:30:16] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Sadly he is.
[05:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I was on a call with him when her water broke :-P
[05:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: HOORAY!
[05:36:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: wow that guy seriously came back for more
[05:36:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: he amazes me 
[05:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld arschmitz: Crap, I'm getting dragged into this... https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-browserstack/pull/15#issuecomment-22003264
[05:45:23] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #15 by mattheworiordan (3mon 2w ago): Version 3 support
[05:46:45] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: HA HA love the last line "There have been exactly zero bug reports to date. Please, tell me again about the quality of my code."
[05:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> I like how he keeps talking about his open source projects.
[05:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> Go look at his public contributions graph.
[05:47:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: pretty weak
[05:52:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: that was an amazing response :D
[05:52:50] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also POINTERDOWN IN IE8!!!11!!oneoneone
[05:52:54] <kborchers> :)
[05:53:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you know what his answer kinda sounds like to me "I'm pissed your not going to let me steal credit from you in your repo so im just going to fork in and then you cant stop me from!
[05:53:42] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i like how i worked for a month on that, then we say, let's just hook in and use jQuery and i get something starting to work in a few hours :)
[05:54:33] <arschmitz> kborchers: how dare you use jQuery!!! what kind of a project do you think this is anyway?
[05:55:27] <kborchers> arschmitz: :) â€¦ well the goal was to get oldIE working in Polymer's PointerEvent polyfill without jQuery and yeah â€¦ no
[05:56:23] <arschmitz> kborchers: i know was just being an ass :)
[05:57:08] <kborchers> :P
[05:57:33] <arschmitz> awesome that it makes it so much easier though
[05:57:52] <kborchers> jQuery Special Events for the WIN!
[05:58:00] <arschmitz> and without re inventing the whole events system
[05:58:35] <kborchers> arschmitz: which is where i was headed and decided it was bad :)
[05:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Well, at least we have a solid answer if anyone asks why we didn't just land support directly in Polymer.
[05:58:54] <arschmitz> yeah i saw you talking about it before
[05:59:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yep
[05:59:32] <arschmitz> and for our own uses its not like jquery could ever NOT be there
[06:02:47] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[06:02:56] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:04:15] <frequent> uGoMobi: did someone stumble on this panel issue yet:
[06:04:53] <frequent> uGoMobi: page A with panel. Panel with link to page B. Click link goes to page B. Browser back button breaks JQM (seemingly)
[06:05:09] <frequent> page A is loaded but then everything is stale
[06:05:21] <arschmitz> frequent: can you make a test page on jsbin?
[06:05:23] <uGoMobi> frequent: external or internal pagen?
[06:05:29] <frequent> internal
[06:05:31] <uGoMobi> panel*
[06:05:35] <frequent> that should work in any case
[06:05:43] <frequent> (testbinning)
[06:06:31] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:06:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Morning
[06:06:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought you renamed button widget
[06:07:15] <arschmitz> we were going to but didnt make it in in time
[06:07:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[06:07:27] <arschmitz> but since we are doing another alpha we can do now
[06:07:47] <uGoMobi> thought you said it was done in button branch when _|Nix|_ wanted to make the change
[06:07:53] <uGoMobi> so thought something went wrong
[06:07:57] <uGoMobi> with merge
[06:08:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also we will have to do $.fn.button = $.fn.buttoninput for back compt
[06:08:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah we can do it now
[06:08:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: noticed that we had issue with download builder
[06:08:46] <arschmitz> i was going to do in that branch but forgot in all the rush and doing it before would have made a messy merge
[06:08:53] <uGoMobi> if you select linked based button you get  button.css which isn't for link based buttons
[06:09:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah true
[06:09:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was thinking i might try to add enhanced option to widgets that dont have yet too
[06:10:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we have to move some CSS too
[06:10:23] <arschmitz> that way we can say all the widgets have it 
[06:11:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's look into alpha 1 issues first
[06:11:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if we have time left, that would be nice indeed
[06:11:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and maybe you need time for autoinit after scott_gonzalez and jzaefferer reviewed it
[06:12:01] <arschmitz> yea we will see on that no idea yet lol
[06:12:11] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:13:11] <frequent> uGoMobi: can't js bin with 2 pages, but here: http://www.franckreich.de/members/export/z/pageA.html
[06:13:34] <frequent> - open panel
[06:13:35] <frequent> - go to page B
[06:13:37] <frequent> - go back
[06:13:39] <frequent> - broken
[06:13:46] <uGoMobi> JS Bin doesn't work anymore with our AJAX nav?
[06:14:10] <frequent> uGoMobi: I don't know. I only tried for 2mins and then made 2 pages
[06:14:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: I'm no specialist "in-the-Bin"
[06:14:40] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:14:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks like a problem with classes not being removed on close
[06:14:56] <uGoMobi> frequent: I have a panel test page here
[06:15:03] <arschmitz> from the wrapper
[06:15:04] <uGoMobi> will test it
[06:15:12] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok
[06:15:31] <frequent> uGoMobi: my testpage is just copy&paste form jsbin
[06:16:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually it looks like animation complete is not happening or something
[06:16:08] <frequent> uGoMobi: it seems that if you leave a page with open panel and the page stays in the DOM, going back to that page does not revert "panel-is-open" status
[06:16:13] <uGoMobi> frequent: sorry, I missed the link to your test page... only saw the JS Bin not working part
[06:16:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds more likely
[06:16:37] <uGoMobi> there is another ticket where I think that is the cause
[06:16:51] <uGoMobi> I think I know the problem aready
[06:16:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is a regression because i remember fixing this exact case back for 1.3
[06:17:08] <frequent> arschmitz: deja-vu
[06:17:31] <uGoMobi> I attached the handler to page container instead of page
[06:17:39] <uGoMobi> I guess we do the same for page transitions
[06:18:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we originally had a whole bunch of issues with panels similar to this i fixed prior to 1.3 looks like one came back
[06:18:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok,I don't remember those issues exactly but I will look for the tickets
[06:18:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in this particular case i think it should be doing an immediate close and its running animation 
[06:19:08] <uGoMobi> that could also be it
[06:19:15] <arschmitz> i think there was a special case for it when navigating 
[06:19:20] <uGoMobi> but it is an issue with the animationend event
[06:20:15] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6254
[06:20:16] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6254 by iwsk416 (2d 21h ago): Panel no longer reopens after page transitions. (1.4-alpha)
[06:21:39] <uGoMobi> well at least we know where need to look
[06:21:53] <uGoMobi> I will take care of it
[06:23:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmmm in this case it should be doing immediate close so something is weird the code still looks ok at first look
[06:23:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[06:23:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I remember that we accepted the PR from jhogervorst
[06:24:02] <uGoMobi> that changed the page event we bind to
[06:24:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what was that for i dont remember 
[06:24:17] <arschmitz> ah that one ok
[06:24:29] <uGoMobi> for closing the panel when leaving the page
[06:24:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its doing it on page hide
[06:25:00] <arschmitz> let me see what it was before though it should not make a difference
[06:28:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it used to be pagebeforehide
[06:28:39] <arschmitz> but i dont think that would make a difference but a good place to start
[06:29:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thought that was apparently prior to 1.3.0 rc 1
[06:34:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, don't see anything odd in the code either
[06:34:49] <uGoMobi> will do some testing
[06:37:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe try 1.3 and see if it happens there too since i dont see any changes since then that would really effect it right off hand
[06:38:35] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6254 looks related to me and says it only occurs in 1.4 alpha
[06:38:35] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #6254 by iwsk416 (2d 21h ago): Panel no longer reopens after page transitions. (1.4-alpha)
[06:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm done with this asshole.
[06:41:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i dont even see how he can argue that? if something has tests and also has a bug or regression it clearly passed the tests?
[06:42:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: idiot
[06:43:18] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15iwsk416 opened issue #6275: BUTTON tag within grid block has no margin (1.4-alpha)  02http://git.io/YDpt6Q
[06:45:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks like a conflict between navbar and regular button css
[06:46:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: navbar?
[06:46:38] <arschmitz> not the panel issue the button marking one that just came in
[06:46:47] <arschmitz> margin*
[06:48:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there is no navbar involved in that issue
[06:48:43] <uGoMobi> bug in the CSS for button elements that I added now they are not wrapped anymore
[06:48:46] <arschmitz> right but there is a special css rule for buttons in grid
[06:48:51] <arschmitz> which is what navbar uses
[06:49:03] <arschmitz> so i just made the assumption
[06:50:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gotcha, I was thinking about that same rule
[06:52:37] <arschmitz> cool might be wrong just made sense to me

[08:00:04] <agcolom> gseguin thank you for the v nice words in your update :-) (meeting minutes)
[10:49:46] <gseguin> agcolom: you're very welcome, thank you!
[10:50:34] <agcolom> finally booked to go to France... will be traveling on sunday... Hope to be in the pool on monday or tuesday!
[10:50:44] <gseguin> nice
[10:59:44] <godswearhats> Hey all, I've been looking at bug #5973.
[10:59:54] <godswearhats> I'm not sure I can reproduce it in the current version.
[11:00:01] <godswearhats> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5973
[11:00:01] <b-ot> godswearhats: Issue #5973 by radiallogic (2mon 3w ago): Checkbox and label different select state
[11:01:24] <godswearhats> I'll comment on the bug I guess.
[11:04:42] <godswearhats> I think it no longer exists.
[11:12:31] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: thanks for looking into that
[11:12:59] <uGoMobi> godswearhats: can you please add which device / iOS version you tested on
[11:13:09] <uGoMobi> add to the comment I mean
[11:13:23] <godswearhats> Oh, sure.
[11:13:30] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[11:13:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and I can test on some other devices with your test pages
[11:14:11] <uGoMobi> if we can't reproduce either we will close it :)
[11:14:13] <godswearhats> Done.
[11:14:20] <uGoMobi> awesome
[11:32:53] <arschmitz> godswearhats: ill test it on everything tonight and i mean EVERYTHING currently have 35 38 assorted devices ios / android / Blackberry / WP and others so if i cant reproduce it does not exist any more :)
[11:33:10] <godswearhats> Wow. Way to intimidate me :-)
[11:33:36] <arschmitz> lol nothing to be intimidated just a lot of phones lol
[11:33:39] <arschmitz> and tablets
[11:33:40] <godswearhats> :-)
[11:34:15] <godswearhats> I hope it's actually gone. I'm still getting my head around how the code works at the highest level, never mind at the details.
[11:34:16] <arschmitz> its handy for us to have a lot for testing we tried to get most of the common devices 
[11:34:23] <godswearhats> For sure.
[11:34:35] <godswearhats> This particular bug wasn't reproducible in the iOS simulator, which was annoying.
[11:34:49] <arschmitz> godswearhats: yeah cant trust simulators
[11:35:07] <arschmitz> godswearhats: we have seen a lot of bugs that either dont happen in them or ONLY happen in them
[11:35:17] <godswearhats> Yeah, I've found that with my own code also.
[11:36:00] <arschmitz> godswearhats: android is hard too because you get things that are device specific rather then version specific
[11:36:17] <arschmitz> making them almost impossible to fix
[11:37:24] <godswearhats> Yeah.
[11:37:32] <godswearhats> Got a Firefox OS device yet? ;-)
[11:38:21] <arschmitz> godswearhats: i do
[11:39:30] <godswearhats> Nice!
[11:40:47] <arschmitz> yeah its cool
[11:41:08] <arschmitz> know a couple people working on firefox OS actually
[11:41:31] <godswearhats> I was debating getting involved in that vs jQuery.
[11:41:46] <godswearhats> But I use jQuery and I wrote a plugin, so it seemed like a better place to start.
[12:16:18] <uGoMobi> gseguin: arschmitz : what components should I select in the download builder (1.4 alpha) if just want buttons and no page?
[12:16:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: arschmitz : besides the button widget and link-based buttons components of course
[12:16:58] <arschmitz> none
[12:17:17] <arschmitz> just select those and the dependencies in the files should take care of the rest
[12:17:19] <gseguin> what about init?
[12:17:32] <arschmitz> cant have init with out pages
[12:17:40] <gseguin> ok
[12:17:55] <gseguin> BTW the fixed Gruntfile is almost ready
[12:18:03] <arschmitz> gseguin: awesome
[12:18:49] <gseguin> I had a question regarding what we put on the cdn
[12:18:49] <uGoMobi> hmm, that's what I thought but doesn't work
[12:18:59] <gseguin> all the images are going on cdn right?
[12:19:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they need to for the css to work
[12:19:34] <arschmitz> i meant that for gseguin^^
[12:19:39] <gseguin> yeah that's what I thought
[12:19:45] <gseguin> ok, that's 211 files
[12:19:48] <uGoMobi> we don't need all images on the CDN
[12:20:04] <uGoMobi> we include all SVG's and PNG's in the ZIP
[12:20:13] <uGoMobi> but the SVG's are inline
[12:21:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah sorry by all i meant pngs
[12:21:24] <gseguin> ha!
[12:21:24] <uGoMobi> so you don't need the images
[12:21:24] <arschmitz> the default style sheet is just pngs
[12:21:24] <gseguin> ok so no svgs on the cdn
[12:21:26] <arschmitz> because like uGoMobisvgs are inline
[12:21:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the default stylesheet is inline SVG and external PNG
[12:21:26] * gseguin goes back grunting
[12:21:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right
[12:21:29] <arschmitz> thats what i said just kinda round about lol
[12:22:02] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it's nice to include the SVG images in the ZIP so you can tweak if you want
[12:22:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as far as buttons
[12:22:20] <gseguin> yes
[12:22:21] <arschmitz> that probably means there is a dependency missing
[12:22:22] <gseguin> I will
[12:22:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you are actually calling button/buttonmarkup right?
[12:22:52] <arschmitz> because there will be no autoinit
[12:25:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right... but I bound to pagecreate :/
[12:25:16] <arschmitz> no page events
[12:25:27] <arschmitz> need to use document ready
[12:25:27] <uGoMobi> habits :(
[12:25:33] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:25:42] <arschmitz> mobile gets you in a different mind set
[12:25:53] <uGoMobi> it sure does :)
[12:26:28] <arschmitz> i need to update my page events demo
[12:26:37] <uGoMobi> something we have to look into is the dependency on core.css of many widgets
[12:26:40] <arschmitz> that i never even put in the demos yet to start lol
[12:26:46] <uGoMobi> because the button style is in there
[12:27:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think when we switch to new amd pattern we should review all dependencies both js and css
[12:27:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: agreed
[12:27:42] <arschmitz> i think thats the time to do it since all the AMD wrappers will be re-written then
[12:28:09] <arschmitz> give us the chance to also look at where maybe we can remove some dependencies 
[12:28:24] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:28:39] <arschmitz> i think we need to find a way to make namespace optional 
[12:29:01] <arschmitz> for data- attributes that is
[12:29:16] <arschmitz> because i dont think most people use it and it has real overhead
[12:29:49] <arschmitz> iv never seen a single example bug anything use the namespace other then the test suite
[12:29:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have you?
[12:30:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, not that I can remember
[12:31:06] <arschmitz> yeah thats what makes me think thats something that should be able to be excluded 
[12:34:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am in favor
[12:34:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: would also mean we can use data- attr in CSS as selector if needed
[12:50:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I agree with what you said in your email...
[12:51:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok thanks
[12:51:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom:  I will have a call with him on Mnday
[12:51:26] <uGoMobi> Monday even
[12:51:54] <agcolom> sounds good. (so glad that's not me ;-) I'm rubbish at that sort of thing!
[12:53:54] <gseguin> uGoMobi: arschmitz: do we really need the theme css on the cdn?
[12:54:11] <gseguin> isn't the structure and the bundle enough?
[12:54:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: don't think we really need it
[12:54:36] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jyohere opened issue #6277: Tapping on a link does not ignore the previous request.  02http://git.io/Z1FKlg
[12:55:02] <uGoMobi> that issue is duplicate if you ask me ^^^
[12:55:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think so too
[12:57:37] <uGoMobi> gseguin: let's remove it from the CDN and see if someone complains and mentions a good reason :)
[12:57:57] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:58:10] <gseguin> but seriously I don't see a good reason
[12:58:39] <gseguin> because someone can use structure and then his own theme
[12:59:14] <gseguin> but if you want the default theme from the cdn you wanna use the bundle, right?
[12:59:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jyohere opened issue #6278: Windows Mobile - Blank white screen appearing over the   02http://git.io/r81WDQ
[13:00:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes exactly
[13:00:55] <uGoMobi> unless you like additional http requests there is no reason

[13:12:11] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so you're saying no svg on the cdn, right?

[13:12:51] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: should I remove them from the 1.4-alpha.1 release ?
[13:16:26] <gseguin> in the cdn repo that is
[13:28:43] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper :-) some update on my holiday. I'll be leaving on sunday, and will be offline for a few days while traveling to the south of France... I think I'll be back online sometime between the 6th and 8th, but will be with my parents, so my not do too much until they leave on the 9th, as I only see them twice a year (Xmas plus a few days in August)
[13:29:18] <agcolom> may not do (not my not do!)
[13:29:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks for the update
[13:29:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: enjoy your vacation!
[13:30:19] <agcolom> thanks :-), yes it will be nice to relax for a bit :-) 
[13:31:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, good to take a break sometimes :)
