[06:29:31] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: ping
[06:29:39] <rxaviers> jasperdegroot, hi
[06:29:48] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: hi!
[06:30:13] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: I just saw your comment about compatibility of the new theme with older versions
[06:31:05] <rxaviers> Yeap, I'm concerned of distributing it on older versions, assuming it's fine, but having never tested it.
[06:31:23] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: I think previous versions of UI should get the theme that was shipped what that version as default theme in the download builder
[06:31:47] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: was looking at the history of the theme.css file
[06:32:01] <rxaviers> I can bring that to today's meeting
[06:32:27] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: commits like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/2500bb39c2af32770944488aa9c4bb45e8c305fa where class names are change will cause issues when you use it with older versions
[06:32:36] <jasperdegroot> changed*
[06:33:38] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: ok, I will make sure I am here during the meeting
[06:33:46] <rxaviers> Awesome. Thanks
[06:48:51] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ^
[06:48:56] <rxaviers> we can discuss that at the meeting
[06:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm not entirely sure what you're thinking about doing with the old versions.
[06:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> Aren't you going to be loading their stylesheets and just inserting the values?
[06:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> Is that not how ThemeRoller works?
[06:52:47] <rxaviers> TR replaces variables of a base theme. It automates that for the developer
[06:52:55] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so isn't that what's going to happen?
[06:53:03] <scott_gonzalez> So changes like the one above don't matter.
[06:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Because you'll be loading the old file, but inserting the new values.
[06:53:41] <rxaviers> Class names arent changed for example
[06:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> Where? In the page?
[06:55:12] <rxaviers> The one jasper pointed out above?
[06:56:01] <rxaviers> One I see being a potential problem is tooltip shadow. After jzaefferer change, it will require that classname to be added via JS
[06:56:03] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: that's why scott_gonzalez says "Aren't you going to be loading their stylesheets"
[06:56:17] <jasperdegroot> their meaning, the one that was shipped with that version
[06:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: But the old tooltip styles have those rules.
[06:56:50] <rxaviers> The question is, if we place the new theme.css along with all other files of the previous packages, will they display just fine?
[06:57:05] <rxaviers> If they do, I'm sure DB/TR will distribute good stuff
[07:01:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we've never supported mixing theme.css from one version with CSS from another version.
[07:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why TR works that way. It doens't load theme.css from the correct version?
[07:02:23] <arschmitz> rxaviers: am i to understand that themeroller uses the same theme.css for every version currently?
[07:03:04] <rxaviers> oh shoot my bad
[07:03:46] <rxaviers> nevermind. It doesn't. It uses the values from the theme. But, uses the theme.css of the respective packages
[07:03:48] <rxaviers> Nevermind
[07:06:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jasperdegroot, ^
[07:06:09] <rxaviers> ignore it please
[07:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: No problem, always good to talk things through.
[07:07:32] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened pull request #7927: Pagecontainer: Remove unnecessary $( ":focus" ) fallback on page changeFixes gh-1560 (06master...061560-focus-cleanup) 02http://git.io/zqyXtw
[07:14:49] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: I think the only thing that needs to be done in the ThemeRoller is some changes in the controls, and those should only apply when someone is using 1.12
[07:15:40] <jasperdegroot> rxaviers: like adding bg texture "none", and removing some of the controls for shadow because you can't set things like opacity anymore
[08:49:16] <rxaviers> jasperdegroot, can you file an issues on https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/ requesting that please?
[08:49:27] <rxaviers> thanks in advance :)

[09:24:18] <fnagel> rxaviers: we had this some time ago but I dont remember the outcome. Spinner tests fail on current datepicker branch. Is it due to Globalize issues or something similar?

[09:25:29] <rxaviers> fnagel, this is out of my cache :). I need to review that.
[09:26:59] <fnagel> Ok, we'll see when you update your PR
[09:40:31] <jasperdegroot> jzaefferer: I wanted to squash my commits for the theme update into 1 commit, but I guess that won't affect my commits that are in your PR?
[09:44:38] <jasperdegroot> fnagel: why are you not happy with .ui-calendar td button::-moz-focus-inner { } ?
[09:45:31] <jasperdegroot> fnagel: that's only way I can think of to remove that 1px that Firefox is adding
[09:46:02] <jzaefferer> jasperdegroot: well, you can cherry-pick my commit into your branch and we go back to your PR
[09:46:14] <jzaefferer> jasperdegroot: or I'll do the squashing later, shouldn't be a problem either
[09:46:31] <jasperdegroot> jzaefferer: last option sounds best
[09:47:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: there's so many comments in the classes PR, I don't know if you really need me to respond to something that scott_gonzalez hasn't already covered. Can you let me know here if you still need input from me?
[09:47:19] <fnagel> jasperdegroot: I wasn't sure its the only way but if this is the best option we have...
[09:47:48] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the only thing is about attr( class ) vs is() vs many hasClass
[09:48:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: both scott_gonzalez and i prefer many has class
[09:49:42] <jasperdegroot> fnagel: if 1px extra doesn't cause problems you could remove that rule and just accept that it is 1px higher on FF
[09:49:42] <arschmitz> fnagel: what specifically is your concern ?
[09:50:48] <jasperdegroot> fnagel: but I am pretty sure there is no other way than using button::-moz-focus-inner { } 
[09:50:57] <fnagel> jasperdegroot: it does cause problems as buttons are used for the day cells. When days are disabled the element is a span -- which is styled differently. 
[09:51:08] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[09:51:30] <fnagel> arschmitz: Just wanted to make sure its the best way. I don't remember using this kind of selector anytime before
[09:51:46] <arschmitz> fnagel: ok fnagelwhy do you change it to a span
[09:52:06] <fnagel> Instead of disabled button?
[09:52:09] <arschmitz> yes
[09:52:10] <fnagel> Good question
[09:52:23] <arschmitz> fnagel: there was an issue previously
[09:52:30] <arschmitz> but i fixed it on master
[09:52:31] <fnagel> We had <a> and <span> before and wanted to use buttons
[09:52:40] <arschmitz> with disabled buttons
[09:52:40] <fnagel> what kind of an issue?
[09:52:54] <arschmitz> style they still interacted with hover states and stuff
[09:53:08] <arschmitz> it was an isue in old datepicker too
[09:53:08] <fnagel> mhh ok
[09:53:33] <arschmitz> but thats fixed in the ui-state-disabled class now
[09:54:04] <fnagel> Mhh ok, good to know. I will add your suggestion to the PR
[09:54:10] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: did that have to do with pointer-events?
[09:54:19] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yes
[09:54:37] <arschmitz> fnagel: yeah seems like a lot of extra logic for nothing
[09:54:40] <jasperdegroot> I remember we had/have issues with that in Mobile too
[09:55:01] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: yeah i think its fixed both now
[09:55:06] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: cool
[09:55:19] <arschmitz> fnagel: but with anchor's you cant disbale them 
[09:55:22] <arschmitz> so maybe thats why?
[09:55:31] <jasperdegroot> do buttons in datepicker get the ui-button class?
[09:55:39] <fnagel> jasperdegroot: no
[09:55:43] <fnagel> not the day cells
[09:55:44] <jasperdegroot> ah ok
[09:55:57] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: they share essentially no style
[09:56:02] <fnagel> arschmitz: with anchors? Buttons with anchors?
[09:56:04] <jasperdegroot> I was thinking it might be a good idea to set that rule for Firefox for all buttons
[09:56:36] <fnagel> jasperdegroot: I assume this is something for a reset.css 
[09:56:42] <arschmitz> fnagel: buttons in datepicker for cells and regular ui buttons
[09:56:53] <fnagel> ahh ok
[09:57:11] <jasperdegroot> fnagel: yeah
[09:57:19] <arschmitz> fnagel: i looked at it to see if it looked worth it when i did button re-write
[09:57:30] <arschmitz> because in re-write the selectmenu is changed to be a ui-button
[09:57:57] <arschmitz> but datepicker didnt share anything to make it make any sense to use that class
[09:58:19] <fnagel> Selectmenu used button widget to generate the selectmenu button before, but we removed that due to massive overhead
[09:58:33] <arschmitz> fnagel: yeah this is just the css
[09:58:36] <arschmitz> not the widget
[09:58:40] <fnagel> ahh ok
[09:58:54] <arschmitz> fnagel: so it depends on ui-button css only
[09:59:04] <fnagel> Its now possible to use button styles without the widget right?
[09:59:16] <arschmitz> fnagel: yeah thats the idea
