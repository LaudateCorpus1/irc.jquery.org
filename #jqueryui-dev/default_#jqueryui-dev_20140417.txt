[00:01:09] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: I dunno ... hook up a webcam to your computer and point it at the phone.
[00:07:33] <Rhomber> i tried using a screen recorder.. but that FIXED the bug.. so yeah, i guess i'll use a real camera
[00:19:00] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Then it's a performance issue.
[00:20:08] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Although, on second thought, that makes no sense, because a screen capture program should /decrease/ performance, making the problem worse. OTOH, it may be a synchronization issue, in which case ... anyway, video will tell, hopefully :)
[00:23:38] <Rhomber> can't be performace, or it would happen when i pressed the button too
[00:28:28] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Right. I spoke too soon.
[00:29:29] <Rhomber> just trying to figure out how to convert this video to something useful
[00:35:11] <Rhomber> ok uploading now :)
[00:40:11] <Rhomber> _[Nix]_: http://tinypic.com/r/28ipb2d/8
[00:40:24] <Rhomber> it kind of stuffed the aspect ratio, but it shows the bug fairly well
[00:46:09] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Excellent!
[00:46:28] <Rhomber> _[Nix]_: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/400/edit
[00:46:40] <Rhomber> it's a crappy project, but I am just scaffolding atm
[00:47:09] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: ... and it's Cordova, so it's the Android WebView, not the browser.
[00:47:50] <Rhomber> I guess, though it would probably happen via the native browser too
[00:48:05] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Could you please file an issue wherein you provide the above two links, as well as the make/module of the phone and the version of Android running on it?
[00:48:05] <Rhomber> it doesn't happen in my chrome though..  
[00:48:54] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: You can load http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/400/ in the Android browser (both Chrome and native) and see if the issue occurs.
[00:48:56] <Rhomber> sure, is it likely to be fixed? I have used a few other platforms and all of them are buggy (i.e. ionic).. I really want to just start developing my app :(
[00:49:06] <Rhomber> yep ok
[00:49:35] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Actually, this may already be fixed.
[00:49:49] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: We had an issue where we were wrapping the panel every time it opens.
[00:49:58] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Lemme see if we've landed that fix already.
[00:50:50] <Rhomber> it's reproducable in the native browser (using the jsbin link)
[00:51:10] <Rhomber> ok cool :)
[00:51:19] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Yeah, then it might be the same bug that causes iframes to reload when you open a panel.
[00:51:27] <Rhomber> though, the jsbin is uing the git js.. so should be the nightly yeah?
[00:51:50] <Rhomber> well, it only glitches when you swipe to open.. not click the button
[00:52:24] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: git is like 5 minutes after we commit to master.
[00:52:34] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: So, I guess we haven't merged the fix yet.
[00:52:41] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: I'll look up the branch that has the fix.
[00:54:18] <Rhomber> thanks :) will be safer than lodging another report.. and would be great if it's been fixed
[00:55:54] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Actually, no. I think the fix doesn't work in this case, or the cause may be different, because the fix has already been merged :(
[00:56:20] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: So please, file that issue :)
[00:57:17] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: There's also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6885 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6220
[00:57:26] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: ... but those are supposedly fixed.
[00:57:43] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: This may also be a theme inheritance bug. Lemme check that thread.
[00:57:56] <Rhomber> ah crap, ok then.. :(
[00:58:14] <Rhomber> let me try and copy the example code exactly
[00:58:52] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: The link to the jsbin, the link to the video, the make/model of the device, and the version of Android should be enough.
[00:59:02] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: The jsbin has all the code we need.
[00:59:23] <Rhomber> yeah, but I copied some example I found on the internet and modified it.. hopefully I cocked something up
[01:01:26] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: This looks like it's straight out of our demos: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/panel-swipe-open/#demo-page
[01:01:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[01:02:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[01:02:14] <uGoMobi> morning
[01:02:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you know what happened to that panel theme inheritance thing?
[01:03:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could Rhomber's video (http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=28ipb2d&s=8#.U0-GpznukzY) be that?
[01:03:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you talking about panel inside or outside page?
[01:03:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Inside. http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/400/edit
[01:04:30] <uGoMobi> hmm... for some reason that video stops playing after couple of seconds
[01:04:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what Android version should I test?
[01:04:59] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: What version of Android is on the phone in that video?
[01:05:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've asked Rhomber to file an issue with this information.
[01:05:25] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[01:05:31] <uGoMobi> thanks Rhomber 
[01:06:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looks like swatch B briefly takes over the whole page before swatch A re-asserts itself over the contents.
[01:06:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I don't see a theme inheritance bug in that JSBin, or maybe I misunderstoond
[01:06:34] <uGoMobi> understood*
[01:07:00] <Rhomber> ok, I just re-did my example
[01:07:20] <Rhomber> it looks better now.. exactly like the demo .. but reduced (only one menu).. still glitches
[01:07:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm thinking the b-swatch from the panel is set on the entire page, then a is set on the contents again, so that's why the whole thing flashes black.
[01:07:23] <Rhomber> will make another video
[01:07:28] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: OK.
[01:07:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am looking at OS X / Chrome now, don't see that issue
[01:07:34] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: What version of Android?
[01:07:38] <Rhomber> 4.0.4
[01:07:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[01:07:51] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:08:21] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: May be better to make the video with the browser, not with Cordova.
[01:10:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm thinking that the classes applied during the animation might influence the page background colour. Or maybe it's the style application being slow :(
[01:14:26] <Rhomber> the browser and cordova are the same result?
[01:15:05] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Well, aren't they? Don't they both flash?
[01:18:53] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: What's your device make/model?
[01:19:15] <Rhomber> yeah they both stuff up..  I took videos of both
[01:19:25] <Rhomber> Motorola RAZR XT885
[01:20:59] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Thanks!
[01:21:17] <_|Nix|_> I'll try to reproduce it on my emulator.
[01:23:26] <Rhomber> thanks for all your help :)
[01:24:12] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: And thank you for bringing this to our attention!
[01:27:34] <_|Nix|_> Reproduced in the emulator.
[01:27:35] <Rhomber> lol, it always seems to happen to me lately :)
[01:27:39] <Rhomber> oh cool
[01:27:53] <Rhomber> I gather you saw I updated the test case?
[01:28:14] <uGoMobi> I just noticed :)
[01:29:24] <_|Nix|_> Gah ... it's almost impossible to swipe on the emulator.
[01:30:12] <_|Nix|_> OK, so it doesn't always happen, but it happens sometimes.
[01:30:17] <Rhomber> lol, that shows in my new video
[01:30:29] <Rhomber> exactly, and when it happens.. then swiping seems to stop as well
[01:30:47] <Rhomber> swiping didn't work previously without setting the threshold to 15.. i think it's because of my pixel density
[01:30:51] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: Can you please share a link to that video?
[01:31:05] <Rhomber> In cordova: http://tinypic.com/r/mbqv13/8
[01:31:11] <Rhomber> uploading the browser one now
[01:32:54] <Rhomber> In android browser: http://tinypic.com/r/2ci9tnn/8
[01:32:59] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[01:34:33] <Rhomber> you can see why i'm frustrated :)
[01:34:48] <_|Nix|_> It's really weird how it just stops working for a short while and then it resumes.
[01:35:04] <Rhomber> yeap, then works like there is no problem
[01:35:51] <Rhomber> so submit a report? or..?
[01:37:15] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: I got it.
[01:37:40] <Rhomber> as in you solved it? or you want to submit it? :)

[01:37:53] <_|Nix|_> Rhomber: ^
[01:38:17] <Rhomber> ah nice :) thanks
[01:39:32] <Rhomber> i like how he just joins to post the message then leaves.. lol
[01:39:41] <frequent> _|Nix|_: Rhomber: hey
[01:39:48] <Rhomber> hey :)
[01:40:09] <frequent> _|Nix|_: just reading up. Could this be a general problem with swipe on Android?
[01:40:26] <frequent> because I'm having the same with the carousel I'm doing
[01:40:38] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, it might be.
[01:42:38] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I was wondering if the swipe horizontal swipe was "swallowed" by any vertical swipe events triggered, but have not had time to look into it - not necessarily related to JQM.
[01:44:26] <Rhomber> tried tinkering with horizontalDistanceThreshold ?
[01:45:37] <Rhomber> mine wouldn't work at all before I set it to 15..  which if that is the 'fix' i would really like to do conditionally (based on pixel density or something).. but I really think that's a bug too.. i.e. it's calculating '30px' wrong
[01:46:04] <Rhomber> like 30 real pixels vs dpx
[02:27:22] <frequent> _|Nix|_: still there?
[03:59:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it's a theme thing. In http://jsbin.com/cuvesujo/2/ I have reversed the swatches, and now it flashes with the colour of the "a" swatch.
[04:01:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It may be a bug in the way it interprets the CSS. During the opening animation, a lot of class addition/removal takes place in panel.open(). One of those may be causing it to apply the /other/ swatch to the page.

[04:24:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I slowed down the fps to illustrate the intermediate state that is causing the flash.
[04:25:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The original: http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=28ipb2d&s=8#.U0-6BTnukzZ
[04:25:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and I reversed the swatches to see if it's theming-related.
[04:26:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does it happen without swipe?
[04:26:42] * uGoMobi is looking
[04:26:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Apparently not.
[04:27:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've reproduced it in the emulator, which is how I was able to do that video.
[04:27:18] <arschmitz> ok
[04:27:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have really bad hardware acceleration, so that helps to slow things down :)
[04:28:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do remember swipe to open is not part of the widget or the library
[04:28:51] <arschmitz> thats a demo
[04:28:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so you are saying it's a rendering performance issue, not an issue with our code?
[04:29:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it's an issue with our code.
[04:29:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For a very brief period of time, the state of the page is such that the panel is fully open and the page has the same swatch as the panel.
[04:30:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then things go back to being correct.
[04:30:59] <uGoMobi> ok
[04:30:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I remember there was a problem with popup too, where it first appears at its final location, then disappears, and then it returns to its final location gracefully, via the animation.
[04:31:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then why would it only happen with swipe
[04:31:52] <uGoMobi> right, swipe or clicking a button triggers the same open method
[04:32:05] <uGoMobi> there we add and remove classes
[04:32:09] <arschmitz> exactly
[04:32:13] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but it doesn't always happen with swipe either.
[04:32:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: point being you should be able to reproduce without
[04:32:46] <_|Nix|_> So, I would say that it happens more rarely when you push the button - waaay more rarely, but I wouldn't bet against it.
[04:33:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I dunno ... swipe may be more processor intensive, because of all the tight-loop mouse processing.
[04:33:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in which case other then try to improve swipe perf there is nothing we can do
[04:33:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What I'm suspecting is that it's not deterministic.
[04:33:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why do we have an intermediate state where the page looks like the animation has already happened and the panel is out.
[04:34:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you briefly add/remove that class, it may cause such an intermediate state.
[04:34:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i would investigate that and ignore swipe if you think this is a bigger problem
[04:34:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly. I'm also ignoring swipe.
[04:34:52] <uGoMobi> we do set the page to transparent and the add theme class to the page container
[04:35:04] <uGoMobi> so if there is an issue in the code I think we should look there
[04:35:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: WHAT! well of course thats the problem in the video
[04:35:25] <arschmitz> you are seeing through the page to the panel
[04:35:33] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.panel.css#L39
[04:35:36] <arschmitz> and then when it becomes non transparent again it fixes
[04:35:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The panel is internal.
[04:35:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so?
[04:36:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So if the page becomes transparent, the panel will become transparent as well.
[04:36:20] <uGoMobi> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L316
[04:36:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or wait ... does the panel place the page inside a wrapper?
[04:36:32] <arschmitz> just its contents
[04:36:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: yeah, so then that might be it.
[04:36:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and it does not set opacity
[04:36:57] <arschmitz> it sets background transparency
[04:37:09] <arschmitz> so panel and other stuff will still be visible
[04:37:21] <_|Nix|_> OK. So we have a weiner :)
[04:38:03] <_|Nix|_> I'll try to comment that out and see if it's still happening.
[04:41:14] <_|Nix|_> That would also explain why the page suddenly takes on the swatch of the panel.
[04:42:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L318 why are we also adding the theme class?
[04:43:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we theme the page container and make the page itself transparent
[04:43:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The -themed class makes it transparent, but the "-" + o.theme class adds the panel's swatch.
[04:43:42] <uGoMobi> no, the -themed class makes its child transparent
[04:43:59] <uGoMobi> where child is the page
[04:44:28] <_|Nix|_> Yes, but the "-" + o.theme class adds the panel's theme class to the page container, not the page's theme class.
[04:44:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[04:44:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the container should have the same bg color as the panel
[04:45:02] <uGoMobi> that is to mask blinks
[04:45:26] <uGoMobi> the wrapper that we create gets the same theme as the page
[04:45:41] <Rhomber> _[Nix]_: Nice slow mo.. and I noticed the colours switched as well when I reversed the themes.. 
[04:46:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, self._page().parent() is the wrapper we create, and at that line it's getting the panel's swatch, not the page's.
[04:47:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, that's the page container
[04:48:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:48:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the wrapper is inside the page
[04:49:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK, so it's <page><wrapper><header><content><footer></wrapper></page>?
[04:49:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[04:50:48] <_|Nix|_> OK, so if the wrapper is created at _create() time, then it should already have the page's theme.
[04:51:02] <Rhomber> I was never able to reproduce it with the button, which is what I tried to show in the videos.. I guess as you say that doesn't make it only related to swipe though.. I just thought the swipe thing might be dragging elements on the page or something.. but that wouldn't explain why it reflects the theme of the panel.. so sounds like you guys are on to it :)
[04:52:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i sugest we just ditch panel and start over probably quicker then fixing the current one ha ha :)
[04:52:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm game, for sure, and re-writing the internals while keeping the API intact is fair game for a minor version.
[04:53:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its on the roadmap somewhere
[04:53:22] <arschmitz> neither uGoMobi or i are happy with the current one
[04:53:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +1
[04:55:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and we should not worry about api
[04:55:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we do it like its a brand new widget the way it "should" be then just add backcompat where needed
[04:55:54] <Rhomber> nice :)
[04:56:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so did making it not transparent make any difference?
[04:56:21] <Rhomber> does it (or will it) use transform3d?
[04:56:29] <arschmitz> Rhomber: no idea
[04:56:32] <arschmitz> it may or may not
[04:56:39] <arschmitz> it does now though
[04:56:43] <uGoMobi> we use transform3D
[04:56:57] <Rhomber> ah ok, well it should.. and that's cool :)
[04:57:19] <arschmitz> Rhomber: im not sure i would say should this causes issues in many places
[04:57:24] <uGoMobi> but the problem is the blinks that is causes when hardware accelleration kicks in
[04:57:54] <uGoMobi> thats why this whole theming trick
[04:57:58] <Rhomber> arschmitz: LOL, i guess.. though my targets are android and iphone.. so transform3d will work fine.. granted.. that's not jquery mobile's targets
[04:58:14] <arschmitz> Rhomber: actually those are places it causes issues
[04:58:20] <arschmitz> Rhomber: its not an issue of support
[04:58:29] <arschmitz> its an issue of other things it does
[04:58:33] <arschmitz> like blinks
[04:58:52] <Rhomber> that sucks :(
[04:59:42] <Rhomber> though I am guessing it's not a usual problem of transform3d and more how the code works?
[05:00:02] <arschmitz> Rhomber: no its how transform3d works
[05:00:58] <arschmitz> on some devices
[05:01:05] <uGoMobi> if we wouldn't set the page container to the same theme as the panel you would see the browser rendering the panel bg while it is opening
[05:01:19] <uGoMobi> with white bg where it isn't rendered yet
[05:01:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i remember that
[05:01:39] <arschmitz> it was like that before
[05:01:41] <Rhomber> ah crap :(
[05:01:52] <uGoMobi> that's because of the transform3d / hardware acceleration
[05:02:12] <Rhomber> does anyone know what the famous guys are doing?
[05:02:22] <uGoMobi> with panel we often added fixes for one thing and introduced new issues at the same time
[05:02:28] <arschmitz> know what the famous guys are doing?
[05:02:33] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:02:45] <uGoMobi> specify famous
[05:03:59] <Rhomber> https://famo.us/ .. sadly there is a 'line' to get access.. though there was a presentation on youtube.. i'll see if i can find it
[05:04:27] <Rhomber> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dClmexNib-I
[05:05:23] <Rhomber> also, with the current panel..  is it possible to use it on multiple pages?.. for me, i'd like to use the same sidemenu on all pages
[05:07:50] <arschmitz> Rhomber: yes just place it outside the page
[05:08:36] <arschmitz> Rhomber: not realy something that applies to what we do that more for games and things like that
[05:08:40] <arschmitz> has a physics engine

[05:11:07] <frequent> _|Nix|_: in Firefox Mobile I can swipe ok, in Android Browser it's really difficult, because the vertical scroll triggers much quicker.
[05:11:33] <Rhomber> arschmitz: Ah fair enough, though they said it can 'render' html too.. like angular js stuff
[05:11:35] <frequent> _|Nix|_: and seems to "swallow" all horizontal swipe efforts
[05:11:46] <Rhomber> _[Nix]_: thanks! :)
[05:13:53] <Rhomber> oh, that was the other thing.. I didn't notice the flicker when using "overlay" only "push" and "reveal"
[05:14:14] <arschmitz> Rhomber: overly is totally different
[05:14:33] <arschmitz> Rhomber: overlay does not need a wrapper or theme juggling 
[05:14:43] <arschmitz> it just has to slide out it does not care about page
[05:16:54] <Rhomber> fair enough
[05:19:05] <_|Nix|_> Great ... my Chrome/desktop does not support 3D transforms, so I can't even test on Chrome/desktop, because the code path is different :/
[05:19:15] <_|Nix|_> I'll try the other video card ...
[05:19:30] <arschmitz> Rhomber: i always use overlay its much simplier and less buggy
[05:22:49] <Rhomber> I am thinking i'll do the same for now
[05:23:10] <Rhomber> _[Nix]_: I don't think mine does either
[05:23:30] <Rhomber> the transitions show shimmering
[05:23:34] <Rhomber> on my phone they don't
[06:14:30] <Rhomber> does the header have a fixed height by default? and anyone know what it is?
[06:15:55] <arschmitz> Rhomber: it does not
[06:16:30] <Rhomber> ah ok, so if i wanted to put an image in it.. are there any guides/practices?

[10:17:04] <arschmitz> gseguin: Pong!
[10:17:15] <gseguin> re: the swipe thing
[10:17:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: oh theres lots of bad news with that
[10:17:30] <arschmitz> but continue
[10:17:36] <gseguin> so if there is a touchstart handler and a touchmove handler
[10:17:53] <gseguin> and in the touchmove handler you do .preventDefault on the event
[10:18:07] <gseguin> scrolling won't work, right?
[10:18:12] <arschmitz> right
[10:18:21] <gseguin> that makes sense
[10:18:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:18:47] <arschmitz> the scroll is what you are preventing when you prevendefault scroll is the default action
[10:19:52] <gseguin> arschmitz: thanks!
[10:20:38] <arschmitz> gseguin: iv been talking to rick byers from google more though
[10:20:56] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah?
[10:21:01] <arschmitz> and they are reverting the changes they made in 35 that made swipe possible again
[10:21:17] <gseguin> ah, that's not good
[10:21:21] <arschmitz> nope

[12:05:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't get how using $( document ).on( "pageshow", "#id", function() {}); does not enable modular coding.
[12:05:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: huh?
[12:06:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the poster's opinion the ability to write modular code hinges on the ability to attach events to the page object.
[12:06:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is not so, because you have delegated events.
[12:06:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i know
[12:07:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only time it makes a difference is if you want to prevent default.
[12:07:16] <arschmitz> i didnt address that in my reply
[12:07:47] <arschmitz> but if they want to be all super modular about things use my onPage plugin
[12:07:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: you still here?
[12:08:06] <gseguin> I am, sorry getting side tracked
[12:08:09] <gseguin> what's up?
[12:08:22] <arschmitz> just had quick download builder question
[12:08:34] <gseguin> sure
[12:08:38] <arschmitz> i was trying to use your repo

[12:09:38] <arschmitz> and im pretty sure i have it all setup right but i keep getting that the works space has not been created
[12:10:22] <gseguin> so you have a bare repo in "repos/"
[12:10:30] <arschmitz> yup
[12:10:36] <gseguin> what's the name of your project?
[12:10:43] <gseguin> is it on github?
[12:10:50] <arschmitz> i was actually just using jqm to test it
[12:10:58] <arschmitz> so i was trying to use the builder with jqm lol
[12:11:05] <gseguin> oh ok, 
[12:11:11] <gseguin> in your staging dir
[12:12:01] <gseguin> it should be <owner>/<tag>/<project>
[12:12:08] <gseguin> that is created
[12:12:49] <gseguin> arschmitz: do you have that?
[12:12:58] <arschmitz> checking
[12:13:23] <arschmitz> i do not
[12:13:31] <gseguin> create it

[12:19:30] <gseguin> it's the other way around

[12:24:03] <gseguin> does that return OK
[12:24:26] <arschmitz> same
[12:24:34] <gseguin> hmm
[12:25:17] <arschmitz> gseguin: im trying to hijack the builder for my own site 
[12:25:27] <arschmitz> so i can allow people that want to use these plugins
[12:25:32] <arschmitz> to still do a custom build
[12:25:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: so im just going to use a clone of jqm with the plugins added to it in their own module 
[12:26:23] <gseguin> and that should work
[12:26:28] <arschmitz> then they can still do a custom build but include like the datepicker or onpage or nested lists etc
[12:26:38] <gseguin> send me your startup command line for the server
[12:27:46] <arschmitz> node server.js -r repos -s staging
[12:28:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: i figure i have so many things in the jqm demos i should probably have a builder and api docs for them lol
[12:28:59] <gseguin> heh :)
[12:29:14] <gseguin> ok, so what's in repos
[12:29:16] <gseguin> ?
[12:29:47] <arschmitz> a bare clone of jqm 
[12:29:54] <gseguin> use my nick everytime as I'm working on something else
[12:29:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: sure
[12:30:04] <gseguin> but in which directory ?
[12:30:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: jquery-mobile
[12:30:45] <gseguin> it should be repos/jquery/jquery-mobile.git
[12:30:51] <arschmitz> oh ok
[12:31:32] <arschmitz> i think thats missing in the readme
[12:31:43] <arschmitz> same with creating the directories inside staging
[12:32:25] <arschmitz> gseguin: ^^
[12:32:49] <gseguin> PR, welcome ;)
[12:32:56] <arschmitz> gseguin: i will
[12:33:10] <arschmitz> because i plan on using this for now at least lol
[12:33:12] <gseguin> If you don't have time I'll try to remember it
[12:33:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: no problem i can do it
[12:33:34] <gseguin> hey I'm glad that thing is getting used out of it
[12:33:50] <gseguin> I wish I had more time to improve the quality and maybe re-design a bit
[12:34:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: seemed like the simplest way to do a builder to add custom pieces to jqm 
[12:34:25] <gseguin> arschmitz: yep or any AMD based project
[12:35:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: would be nice to beable to to npm install it
[12:35:53] <arschmitz> and just start the server 
[12:36:13] <gseguin> It's in NPM
[12:36:16] <arschmitz> oh is it
[12:36:22] <gseguin> node-amd-builder
[12:36:27] <arschmitz> ok cool
[12:36:47] <gseguin> let me double check the name
[12:37:03] <arschmitz> need to automate the directory creation based on start or something though so you dont have to set up all the directories that would be cool
[12:37:34] <gseguin> it was kind of on purpose
[12:37:43] <arschmitz> oh?
[12:37:51] <gseguin> a way to control what to expose
[12:37:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:38:10] <gseguin> but it may not have been smart
[12:38:20] <gseguin> or there should be an option to auto-create
[12:38:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:39:20] <arschmitz> hmmm 
[12:39:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: so im just getting {} now

[12:47:49] <arschmitz> jquery is in both of those
[12:48:09] <arschmitz> but doing repos/* returns whats in directory inside that directory

[12:48:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: ^

[13:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I've wanted this for a while.
[13:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> I've been tempted to build it before, but it just seemed like too much work to make it good.
[13:24:16] <gseguin> and it integrates with Google Hangouts which is pure awesomeness!
[13:24:34] <gseguin> I think it's using meteor 
[13:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> Cool. I haven't heard much about it since the initial noise during the announcement.
[13:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> It looked pretty powerful. I'm surprised there hasn't been much noise about it on the node mailing list.
[13:25:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess everyone using it is on a meteor mailing list instead.
[13:27:48] <gseguin> I'm on neither of those, I heard of it through someone at work
