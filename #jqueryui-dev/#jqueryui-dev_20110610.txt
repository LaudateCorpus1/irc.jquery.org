[02:52:22] * hhillen pokes jzaefferer 
[02:53:14] <jzaefferer> hey Hans
[02:53:31] * jzaefferer pokes hhillen
[02:54:40] <hhillen> Hi jzaefferer, I made the change for popup, there's just one issue left
[02:54:58] <hhillen> And that has to do with the use of aria-owns
[02:55:12] <hhillen> It's causing a bug in JAWS
[02:55:50] <hhillen> See my line note in the pull request
[02:56:09] <jzaefferer> okay, looking
[02:56:48] <hhillen> I've notified FreedomScientific of the issue, but we need to think about whether we want to leave aria-owns in or not
[02:57:53] <jzaefferer> does it work properly when we remove it? or do we need something else?
[02:58:29] <hhillen> It does work properly when we remove it, but aria-owns is the correct markup to use
[02:58:56] <jzaefferer> ugh
[02:59:31] <jzaefferer> let's leave it in, along with an inline comment, and discuss that in Toronto?
[02:59:37] <jzaefferer> we won't release 1.9 before that anyway
[03:00:46] <hhillen> There is one other advantage of using aria-owns with JAWS though: When you move focus away from the popup and back into it, aria-owns will make JAWS announce both the trigger element and the dialog before announcing the focused element inside the dialog (without aria-owns it only announces the dialog first). However, this isn't really a realistic use case because the popup would normally collapse when focused is moved somewhere else anyway
[03:01:15] <hhillen> Yes, let's leave it in
[03:01:21] <hhillen> It works find in NVDA by the way
[03:01:53] <jzaefferer> okay
[03:05:16] <gnarf> is the ui.menu.js we have in master getting any refactors?
[03:09:20] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/358/files I'm pretty sure that adding a return false, and removing a var assignment is bad, however the redeclared var / missing semicolon errors in jslint are disturbing
[03:09:48] <gnarf> i'll let someone who knows better close that one out
[03:11:03] <Peeter> Whats the ETA of 1.9 ?
[03:11:16] <jzaefferer> gnarf, close it, and apply the valid fixes manually
[03:11:39] <jzaefferer> the commit message is also bad, those aren't no typos
[03:11:50] <jzaefferer> Peeter, this year
[03:12:12] <jzaefferer> next jQuery conference is early October, should be done before that
[03:12:35] <jzaefferer> see also http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138038/Roadmap
[03:13:12] <jzaefferer> hhillen, did you have something else for that popup pull request? otherwise I'll merge that now
[03:13:33] <hhillen> jzaefferer: you can merge it
[03:14:26] <jzaefferer> will do
[03:14:44] <jzaefferer> nevermind that inline comment, but I'll mention that issue on the ARIA Hackathon page
[03:20:40] <jzaefferer> nice, now working fine even in IE6
[03:21:35] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-ui/commit/0a0d2ad26cff5fa14f7b44e9a934a744bf4e7475 seem ok?

[03:35:05] <bot-t> [#6669] stopPropagation does not work ( function(event) {) - http://jqbug.com/6669
[03:35:37] <gnarf> i tend to agree with the bug report :)
[03:37:21] <gnarf> but it hasn't been marked valid yet
[03:39:50] <gnarf> SRY - http://jqbug.com/ui/6669 -- that line of code is 2 years old, I just want one person to say "agreed" before I merge http://jqbug.com/ui/p337
[04:04:22] <gnarf> oh well, sleeping - if i had a test case for that one i'd be more confident to merge it
[04:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: due to an annoyance of how pbwiki works, don't describe your changes
[04:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> it prevents the actual changes from being sent in a notification email
[04:39:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lol
[04:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> also, --squash implicitly does a --no-commit
[04:39:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: noted
[04:39:27] <gnarf> orly?
[04:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[04:39:43] <gnarf> here i've wasted keystrokes
[04:39:46] <gnarf> :/
[04:39:47] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[04:40:03] <gnarf> repeating cuz you weren't here 30 minutes ago
[04:40:03] <gnarf> http://jqbug.com/ui/6669 -- that line of code is 2 years old, I just want one person to say "agreed" before I merge http://jqbug.com/ui/p337
[04:40:25] <gnarf> no test or anything
[04:40:29] <gnarf> kinda bugs me
[04:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> if you can verify it manually, then you can merge
[04:41:09] <gnarf> can i also be lazy and ask the dude that fixed it to actually create a jsfiddle to show the bug? :)
[04:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[04:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> actually, why is that check even there?
[04:41:52] <gnarf> *shrug*
[04:41:59] <gnarf> i'll just go to bed
[04:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> seems like a better fix would be to remove the if statement
[04:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> inst.input has to be a jQuery object
[04:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> so it must either contain 0 or 1 items, depending on whether it's an inline datepicker
[04:42:50] <gnarf> that _ in irc that isn't on github confuses me
[04:43:14] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/337#issuecomment-1341651
[04:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> gotta keep you on your toes
[04:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> nothing in GitHub, underscore in IRC, dot in email, ...
[04:44:22] <gnarf> tweet tweet?
[04:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> underscore
[04:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> the order is dot, underscore, nothing when creating a username
[04:45:21] <gnarf> :)
[04:45:38] <gnarf> gnarf / gnarf37 / give up
[04:46:03] <gnarf> i've been avoiding sleep for like 3 hours now, and I'm not really sure why... so I'm gonna go get caught up :)
[04:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> heh, sounds like you've been avoiding sleep for more than 3 hours
[04:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> considering it's almost 7a for you
[04:56:39] <gnarf> its a horrible habbit of mine
[04:56:50] <gnarf> brain gets fired up and doesn't slow down sometimes
[05:01:27] <gnarf> heh http://twitter.com/#!/k_borchers/status/79118541491683328
[05:02:22] <gnarf> has he been coming to meetings?
[05:07:59] <jzaefferer> hey Corey, welcome on board!
[05:08:13] <jzaefferer> nice to finally have another commiter :-)
[05:23:21] <gnarf> jzaefferer: before you commented I wasn't gonna do that
[05:23:33] <gnarf> now i definitely need sleep....

[05:24:28] <jzaefferer> ha, okay
[05:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm pretty sure he's been at meetings, at a minimum he's in here sometimes
[08:58:20] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers, just checked out the inputmenu demo
[08:58:23] <jzaefferer> commented on the wiki
[08:58:38] <jzaefferer> in general, that's exactly the type of prototyping we need
[08:58:39] <kborchers> thanks, i'll take a look
[08:58:50] <jzaefferer> so much to explore there
[09:01:36] <kborchers> yeah ... it's been fun so far. thanks for the feedback. sorry for breaking the references, i'll fix my local testbed to reflect the repo so that doesn't happen again. i was looking at using actual inputs but figured i would get it working this way first. i'll keep working. thanks!

[12:40:27] <kborchers> jzaefferer just added a new version to the wiki for menu. let me know what you think. https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/blob/5b55c18b6b4053a24197ea0048a067f66bd46944/tests/visual/menu/inputmenu.html

[12:43:18] <kborchers> hey gnarf
[12:43:24] <kborchers> told you i'm in here
[12:43:28] <kborchers> ;)
[12:43:39] <gnarf> ;) so many names its hard to remember who's been at the meetings ;)
[12:45:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah sure

[13:30:54] <gnarf> im trying to figure out exactly wtf is going on here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/308/files#L0R346
[13:31:24] <gnarf> seems like that has to have a smaller way to write it
[13:53:28] <jquicommit> jquery-ui: master tomykaira * 3e0d3c9 (1 files in 1 dirs): Effects.transfer: check the target is fixed or not, and consider scrolling. Fixed #5547 - Transfer effect to fixed positioned element. - http://bit.ly/iwzRtO
