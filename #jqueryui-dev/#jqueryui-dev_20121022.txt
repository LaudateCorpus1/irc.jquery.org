[08:29:19] <_zoggy_> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=779399 - about buttons in firefox 16.0.1 showing a horz line in the middle of the button on hover, when it uses a gradiant bg
[08:36:38] <_zoggy_> hmm, lesser known bug. it would appear that doing "use strict" causes issues in safari 6 -- https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/issues/392
[08:50:56] <kborchers> _zoggy_: i'm confused … do these issues affect jQuery UI? if so, an actual bug report with a reduced test case at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ would be much more helpful than random links to other bug trackers and github repos
[09:22:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think i came up with a way to test options
[09:22:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we make a "test" effect that puts the "parsed options" on .data() so we can test the results
[09:24:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That seems fine.
[09:34:49] <_zoggy_> just was sharing info that might be useful in the future. if it was jui specific i would post a bug report as ive done in the past

[12:27:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we land mikesherov's pull?
[12:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I haven't had time to test it to make sure it works properly with the command line tool and sublime, but sure.
[12:29:36] <mikesherov> Not sure in sublime
[12:29:46] <mikesherov> But works in grunt and the unit tests
[12:29:53] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:29:58] <gnarf> npmjs is slow as shit today
[12:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Right, my concern is whether this totally breaks other uses of .jshintrc.
[12:30:36] <mikesherov> Right, understood
[12:30:48] <gnarf> alright, ill hold off
[12:30:50] <mikesherov> But that's the format for latest JSHint period
[12:31:16] <mikesherov> I can test the sublime plugin if needed

[12:44:23] <mikesherov> .
[13:13:05] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: my pull doesn't work with the cli JSHint
[13:13:10] <mikesherov> as you predicted
[13:13:32] <mikesherov> apparently, the .jshintrc format is for node-jshint
[13:13:39] <mikesherov> and not for the cli jshint
[13:13:41] <mikesherov> which is stupid
[13:14:03] <mikesherov> so, I can fix it so it;s back the way you had it
[13:14:26] <mikesherov> but still maintain the updated package
[13:15:16] <mikesherov> there was an extra jshint file that wasn't used by grunt
[13:15:27] <mikesherov> I guess I can fix that too
[13:15:35] <mikesherov> actually, no
[13:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: The way JSHint works in CLI vs. JS in annoying.

[13:43:59] <gnarf> i want to land this pull, but not sure what I need to do RE: CLA
[14:42:11] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: upgraded the pull
[14:42:21] <mikesherov> gnarf: the JSHint pull works now again
[14:42:27] <mikesherov> should work in all environments
[14:43:05] <gnarf> mikesherov: awesome
[14:43:11] <gnarf> after npmjs starts behaving again
[14:43:15] <gnarf> i'll land it
[14:43:17] <mikesherov> k
[14:43:37] <mikesherov> I'm going to go ahead and assume you're going to land it, and then fix all the undefs
[14:51:20] <gnarf> mikesherov: so um
[14:51:27] <gnarf> "grunt" still seems to blow way up
[14:51:37] <gnarf> at least on my build
[14:51:55] <mikesherov> npm install
[14:52:12] <gnarf> i even rm -rf node_modules; npm install
[14:52:29] <gnarf> still getting a slew of jshint onevar,etc warnings
[14:53:01] <gnarf> i'm sitting on 7a2b22c
[14:54:13] <gnarf> in the lint:grunt task
[14:54:41] <mikesherov> Repull my branch
[14:56:29] <gnarf> thats yer HEAD
[14:56:32] <gnarf> on jshint
[14:57:44] <gnarf> strangely
[14:57:52] <gnarf> it doesn't seem like it should even be looking in these files
[14:58:09] <gnarf> Linting build/dist/jquery-ui-1.9pre/tests/jquery-1.6.js...ERROR
[14:59:41] <mikesherov> Yeah, it shouldn't
[15:00:00] <gnarf> wtf
[15:00:02] <gnarf> okay
[15:00:15] <gnarf> apparently if there is a build/dist file
[15:00:18] <gnarf> it lints it
[15:00:21] <gnarf> and thats been my problem
[15:00:38] <gnarf> had to git clean -fdx

[15:06:36] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Build: Upgrade to the latest Grunt and JSHint - Closes gh-786
[15:16:25] <mikesherov> gnarf: are we cool now?
[15:16:37] <gnarf> yup
[15:16:47] <mikesherov> cool
[15:17:01] <mikesherov> this friday, we're hacking on mergeatron
[15:17:12] <mikesherov> getting it to the point where it doesn't need a DB at all
[15:17:14] <gnarf> mikesherov: count me in
[15:17:45] <mikesherov> awesome, would be great for both SNAP and jQuery
[15:17:56] <gnarf> yeah
[15:18:13] <gnarf> i don't feel like figuring out why bot.io broke when mergeatron is a lot closer to where we want to be i think
[15:18:14] <mikesherov> one of the easiest ways to do this is have it go through Jenkins still too.
[15:18:23] <gnarf> right
[15:18:29] <gnarf> totally possible
[15:18:32] <mikesherov> well, also, you have a company willing to build it out
[15:19:02] <gnarf> is it published on npm yet?
[15:19:06] <mikesherov> um, the real reason for jenkins is because you want a public URL for results
[15:19:21] <mikesherov> I don't think so yet
[15:19:28] <mikesherov> We'll do that Friday
[15:19:57] <gnarf> mikesherov: well - mergatron could keep a "public dir" like botio did
[15:20:03] <mikesherov> sure
[15:20:05] <gnarf> but really, jenkins already does this for us
[15:20:06] <gnarf> so
[15:20:16] <mikesherov> that's fine too, but Jenkins already serves that purpose
[15:20:20] <mikesherov> eventually, that's a nice goal
[15:20:33] <mikesherov> we can skype on Friday and go over the whole thing
[15:21:08] <gnarf> time?
[15:21:40] <mikesherov> we're hacking 10AM-6:30PM, so any time within then
[15:21:43] <mikesherov> earlier the better
[15:22:10] <gnarf> roger, I should be around most of that - got a few afternoon meetings, but will see you then
[15:23:54] <mikesherov> awesome
[15:24:15] <mikesherov> gnarf: if you want a good laugh, turn on unused:true in the new jshint
[15:24:42] <gnarf> good enough laugh that we should make an issue to turn it on? :)
[15:24:56] <mikesherov> Yeah, I can tackle it
[15:25:09] <mikesherov> if you guys need tixx for that, I'll add one
[15:26:08] <mikesherov> ok, doing
[15:39:55] <gnarf> well, i didn't expect you to volunteer :)
[15:40:13] <gnarf> just didn't want to forget that we want to turn it on
[16:27:39] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: you there?
[16:28:20] <mikesherov> or gnarf:?
[16:28:26] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: here
[16:28:41] <jzaefferer> mikesherov: though I may disappear any minute, depending on the events unfolding here...
[16:28:47] <mikesherov> k
[16:28:52] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: now that new JSHint is in place on jquery-ui
[16:28:58] <jzaefferer> is it?
[16:29:00] <mikesherov> I'm trying to turn on "unused:true"
[16:29:12] <mikesherov> yeah, I just got the pull merged in by gnarf
[16:29:17] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i merged it 80 mins ago
[16:29:24] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[16:29:25] <mikesherov> pull upstream master and then npm install
[16:29:35] <mikesherov> so, trying to turn on unused true
[16:29:48] <mikesherov> only problem is that some globals are defined in one file but used in the next
[16:29:54] <mikesherov> so JSHint doesn't like that
[16:30:08] <jzaefferer> any specifics?
[16:30:10] <gnarf> examples?
[16:30:39] <mikesherov> tests/unit/selectable/selectable_core.js
[16:30:43] <mikesherov> var drag = ...
[16:31:13] <mikesherov> gets used in tests/unit/selectable/selectable_options.js
[16:31:25] <gnarf> i think we made a namespace to put those on in other unit tests
[16:31:28] <mikesherov> right
[16:31:34] <mikesherov> that's what I was thinking
[16:31:49] <jzaefferer> yeah, that :-)
[16:31:59] <gnarf> theres like a "testHelpers" you can punch
[16:32:04] <mikesherov> window.TestHelpers
[16:32:18] <mikesherov> So, I can just dangle it off of that
[16:32:29] <mikesherov> is that what you'd suggest?
[16:32:40] <gnarf> seems the right way to me
[16:32:47] <mikesherov> there are SOOOO many global convenience test helpers
[16:32:53] <mikesherov> we should standardize that
[16:33:06] <jzaefferer> we should also get rid of most of them
[16:33:09] <mikesherov> HAHAH
[16:33:12] <mikesherov> there's that too
[16:33:14] <gnarf> is there a more logical place on qunit itself?
[16:33:40] <jzaefferer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc
[16:33:43] <mikesherov> for this exercise, I'm going to attach it to window.TestHelpers
[16:34:03] <mikesherov> and then at a later date, refactor that
[16:34:14] <jzaefferer> riiiiight
[16:34:15] <mikesherov> but at least it gets all the helps into a namespace
[16:34:15] <jzaefferer> :-)
[16:34:21] <mikesherov> Oh, I will :-)
[16:34:34] <mikesherov> ok, so that sounds good. That's what I'll do
[16:34:35] <mikesherov> thanks guys
[16:34:46] <mikesherov> there are only like 250 unused in tests :-P
[16:36:42] <jzaefferer> haha
[16:36:46] <jzaefferer> what a mess
[16:36:59] * gnarf thanks mikesherov
[16:37:05] <mikesherov> np
[16:37:09] <mikesherov> I like cleaning up
[16:37:11] <jzaefferer> don't bother too much with dialog tests, we're going to clear a lot of those out in the next days
[16:37:13] <mikesherov> it's cathartic
[16:37:18] <mikesherov> Yeah, I'm going anyway
[16:37:24] <mikesherov> even if you're clearing out
[16:37:27] <mikesherov> I need a clean lint
[16:37:50] <mikesherov> I can always rebase if it's conflicted
[16:38:22] <gnarf> ?ts
[16:38:22] <bot-t> That's Sexual™
[16:38:49] <jzaefferer> testing dialog is so much fun: http://bassistance.de/i/0205c8.png
[16:39:32] <mikesherov> ugh
[16:41:07] <gnarf> jzaefferer: and then do it all with JAWS
[16:41:15] <gnarf> ;)
[16:44:40] <jzaefferer> and then there's awesome stuff like this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7107 "z-index: 2147483583 (css maximum supported)" "The reason for this is that elem.css('zIndex') returns '2.14+e9', which gets evaluated to 2 after parseInt()."
[16:44:55] <jzaefferer> luckily we got rid of the entire z-index mess, so everything related to that is fixed
[17:04:51] <jzaefferer> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4892 "I hope the problem will be over soon.."
[17:12:22] <zjs> jzaefferer: "Opened 3 years ago"...
[17:14:48] <gnarf> zjs: :)
[17:15:47] <zjs> I guess 3 years and a couple of weeks might be considered "soon" on a geological or cosmological timescale.
[17:27:40] <jzaefferer> zjs: yeah, we're more like a tectonic plate here :-)
[19:06:56] <RBeuligmann> @jzaefferer, or anyone else, Is there an example page for menu widgets with icons?
[19:22:52] <_zoggy_> Icons are supported by adding a class of ui-menu-icons to the menu element, which happens automatically when there is an element within the menu with the class ui-icon. The ui-menu-icons class adds some padding to the left to offset menu items (with or without icon). The icon generated for submenus isn't affected and will continue to be positioned on the right.
[19:23:52] <_zoggy_> http://kborchers.github.com/jquery-ui-extensions/menu/inputmenu.html#
[19:24:00] <kborchers> RBeuligmann: check out the visual tests here http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/visual/menu/menu.html
[19:25:27] <_zoggy_> should show demo with menu icons and have them invert/use hover set for dark/light purpose
[19:25:37] <_zoggy_> as all the demos are for light theme only
[19:25:49] <kborchers> _zoggy_: that input menu extension may be outdated … don't remember the last time i merged master into that. just fyi
[19:26:27] <_zoggy_> yeah, was talking about your visual test link
[19:26:36] <_zoggy_> yeah, that inputmenu demo is a bit old :x
[19:27:01] <_zoggy_> thought there was a demo with icons on the jui site.. but wasnt
[19:27:09] <_zoggy_> had to go google and stubmled upon your page
[19:28:54] <RBeuligmann> thanks guys, was looking around for some links, guess i was just looking in all the wrong places
[19:35:45] <RBeuligmann> I knew i had seen one of the pages before
[19:38:23] <mikesherov> my eyes are bleeding
[19:41:11] <RBeuligmann> I total you to page more attention to warning on the bottom of the page in the ninja handbook about sharpening the edge of your contacts
[19:56:34] <mikesherov> gnarf: kborchers: jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: review please https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/788
[19:56:49] <mikesherov> cmon bot-t: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/788
[19:56:57] <mikesherov> oh, where's socialhapy?
[19:57:06] <mikesherov> Fixes #8714: turn on "unused": true in JSHint
[19:59:24] <gnarf> mikesherov: is that one inside color?
[19:59:33] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/788/files#L51R248
[19:59:49] <gnarf> mikesherov: we should prolly update that too
[20:00:20] <gnarf> so, there are a few lines like https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/788/files#L51R248 where I really want to keep the signature visible there
[20:00:30] <mikesherov> gnarf: I can fix color
[20:00:35] <mikesherov> Afterwards
[20:01:18] <mikesherov> Yeah, the "keep the signature" idea is something I'm on the fence about
[20:02:01] <gnarf> i mean, its kinda lame to do /* args */, but it might make sense here, having "unused" on will likely warn us about future smell
[20:02:08] <mikesherov> gnarf: In src, it's wasted bytes
[20:02:32] <mikesherov> I'll update it however you'd like
[20:02:52] <mikesherov> I can either do inline JSHint configs or commented fake args
[20:03:05] <mikesherov> I'd prefer the latter because uglify catches it
[20:03:23] <mikesherov> And because its clearer, IMHO
[20:03:41] <mikesherov> I'd actually prefer true JSDoc, but whatever
[20:04:16] <mikesherov> Gnarf: just leave me comments and ill update in AM
[20:04:54] <gnarf> ill leave that one to scott_gonzalez / jzaefferer -- it's their codebase :)
[20:05:15] <gnarf> but, i tend toward commented fake args also
[20:05:57] <mikesherov> Cool
[20:06:15] <mikesherov> It's everyone's codebase! They just maintain it :P
[20:06:40] <mikesherov> Anyway, my eyes are bleeding now
[20:06:53] <mikesherov> Gnight gnarf thanks again!
[20:59:42] <gnarf> btw mikesherov - on the topic of color, do you have any opinion for landing this "number" representation: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/pull/44 ??
