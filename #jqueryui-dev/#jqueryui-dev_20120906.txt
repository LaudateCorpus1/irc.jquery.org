[05:33:55] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/uku3Aw
[05:33:55] <jquicommit> [api.jqueryui.com/master] Updated markup for widget options. - Scott González
[05:58:26] <gnarf> hey - so anyone have an opinion on expires headers for the CDN? how long should we set them for?
[06:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> For versioned files, many years.
[06:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> For -latest, -stable, -git, whatever, something smaller.
[06:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> -git should be super low.
[06:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> But latest/stable/whatever else we have, can probably be 1 day.
[06:13:56] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: much!
[06:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> Did you know that @placeholder is supported in all browsers (even IE, starting with IE10) unprefixed?
[06:17:27] <gnarf> hrm
[06:17:41] <gnarf> so do all of our "latest" have "latest" in their name, same with "git" ?
[06:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure which projects have "latest" builds.
[06:18:36] <gnarf> I'm afraid of setting 1 year cache headers
[06:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[06:19:00] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js
[06:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> That's -git
[06:19:23] <gnarf> it has latest in the url
[06:19:27] <gnarf> damnit
[06:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's bad.
[06:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> We should make them change it.
[06:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> The CSS rules in web-base-template are so overly specific it's really hard to work with.
[06:35:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: there is so much going on though that if you get too general you start messing up other areas you didn't intend to touch. it's a fine line but i'm sure some stuff could be made more general and/or moved into individual themes
[06:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm cleaning up a lot of the stuff related to search forms right now.
[06:37:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's a huge mess.
[06:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> For example: #container header nav .searchform .icon-search
[06:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> That's crazy specific.
[06:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> .icon-search is likely good enough.
[06:38:27] <kborchers> yeah, that's pretty rediculous
[06:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> The whole site is styled like this.
[06:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes even multiple ids in the selector.
[06:38:52] <kborchers> really? wtf?
[06:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's painful to work with.
[06:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> I've been trying to cut down as much as I can.
[06:39:54] <scott_gonzalez> Also simplifying things like using @placholder instead of using JS to show/hide the label and CSS to overlay the label on the input.
[06:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> IE7-9 users can just deal with not having a placeholder.
[06:40:28] <kborchers> i didn't do that because of ie7-9
[06:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you wrote this code.
[06:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/js/scripts.js#L6-23
[06:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> What did you think I was referring to?
[06:41:27] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: no but i made the label responsive and was like "Why don't i just use @placeholder" and then ie7-9 made me not do it
[06:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[06:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> Was that specifically for the search form?
[06:42:13] <kborchers> yes
[06:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> I think people will figure it out.
[06:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> There's a search icon in the field.
[06:43:15] <kborchers> yeah
[06:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check our browser stats.
[06:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> IE is 8.5%
[06:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> 51% of that is IE9.
[06:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> 39% is IE8.
[06:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> 2% is IE10.
[06:44:32] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: as long as there is stuff for AT and not just an icon
[06:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> There's a label with color: transparent.
[06:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> So the info is available to AT.
[06:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> But visually hidden.
[06:45:33] <kborchers> cool
[06:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> Screen magnifiers would still see the placeholder (if not using IE) and the icon.
[06:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome is at 50%
[06:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> IE with Chrome Frame: 0.08%
[07:22:03] <_zoggy_> you can do placeholder.. just have to load the shiv
[07:22:07] <_zoggy_> or use modernizer
[07:22:22] <_zoggy_> and for ie6 you can suggest people to use chrome frame
[07:23:54] <_zoggy_> also stuff like: https://github.com/miketaylr/jQuery-html5-placeholder/blob/master/html5placeholder.jquery.js
[07:25:01] <_zoggy_> http://miketaylr.com/code/input-type-attr.html
[08:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> wtf? text-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.796875)
[08:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> Is that level of precision on the opacity really necessary?
[08:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> This whole things is just full of overly specific insanity.
[08:27:17] <gnarf> ?js 0.796875 * 255
[08:27:20] <bot-t> gnarf: 203.203125
[08:31:11] <kborchers> gnarf: it's just opacity so between 0 and 1 but good try at trying to justify that crazy number :)
[08:31:44] <gnarf> kborchers: yeah, but i mean, most compositing still works on 8 bit alpha
[08:32:00] <gnarf> ?js 203/255
[08:32:01] <bot-t> gnarf: 0.796078431372549
[08:32:50] <kborchers> gnarf: honestly my first thought was it was generated by one of those online CSS3 style generators
[09:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> DAMN YOU EDITORCONFIG!
[09:23:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ?
[09:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> I installed the editorconfig plugin for Sublime. Now it's trimming trailing whitespace on save.
[09:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> Which means I can't cherry-pick to 1-8-stable.
[09:25:21] <gnarf> oh, and fix the merge conflicts?
[09:25:33] <gnarf> because it will trim whitespace on the rest of the file?

[09:43:18] <DaveMethvin> oh what a tangled repo we trace, when we forget to trim whitespace
[09:52:49] <kborchers> hey anyone have recommendations on merging a PR but you don't want one of the commits other than asking them to remove the commit or cherry-picking around it? scott_gonzalez gnarf jzaefferer
[09:53:13] <gnarf> kborchers: merge it then revert the one you don't like on a temp branch then squash it
[09:53:45] <kborchers> gnarf: hmmm, yeah i think i like that. thanks
[09:53:45] <gnarf> or remove it from history with a rebase
[09:53:52] <jzaefferer> kborchers:  these days I always use an interactive rebase
[09:53:53] <gnarf> on the temp branch
[09:53:53] <jzaefferer> sooo
[09:54:13] <jzaefferer> `git checkout -b <#prnumber> [fork/branch]` to create a local branch
[09:54:22] <jzaefferer> then `git rebase master -i` to start the interactive rebase
[09:54:31] <jzaefferer> the reword, squash or whatever
[09:54:37] <jzaefferer> then checkout master and merge that branch
[09:55:01] <jzaefferer> which is actually not what you were asking for :/
[09:55:07] <jzaefferer> what gnarf said ;)
[09:55:09] <kborchers> cool, so that's basically what gnarf's second suggestion was
[09:55:16] <kborchers> hah, ok cool
[09:55:24] <kborchers> thanks guys
[09:55:25] <gnarf> you could do it with a rebase too, just remove the one commit from the log
[09:55:25] <jzaefferer> still, interactive rebase is nice, if you havent' used that yet, give it a try
[09:55:41] <kborchers> jzaefferer: yeah, i'm going to try that out
[10:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, we have icon sprints and icon fonts. And we're using the same class for both!
[10:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> s/sprints/sprites/
[10:18:38] <scott_gonzalez> I cannot type anymore.
[10:19:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: workers comp?
[10:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> yes please
[10:19:23] <gnarf> complain to ajpiano
[10:19:29] <gnarf> :)
[10:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The mental stress of working on the new sites has broken my ability to type. I need $100,000 in workers comp.
[10:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> Please take it out of the misc. line item :-)
[10:21:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lolz
[10:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> There are two search boxses on this page: http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/
[10:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> They use the exact same markup.
[10:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> The small one in the nav is using an image sprite for the icon (which is on the right)
[10:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> And the big one in the banner is using a font for the icon (which is on the left).
[10:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> How am I supposed to remain sane while working on this?
[11:11:06] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: lol MISC ALL THE THINGS
[11:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> This took way too long: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/2437472b17fb767d3d179f42e2ba9be163f7330c
[11:57:14] <scott_gonzalez> All I wanted to do was remove the id from the search field.
[12:07:47] <kborchers> ummmm, wow :/
[12:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: How can I set the number of results to show on a search page?
[12:14:18] <nacin> what do you want it to be?
[12:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: 1 for testing.
[12:21:34] <nacin> check out web-base-template/mu-plugins/api-sites/category-listings.php
[12:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:21:53] <nacin> same deal, just check $query->is_search() in addition to is_main_query()
[12:22:01] <nacin> posts_per_page can be set there.
[12:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[13:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What's the deal with $big in http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/paginate_links#Examples ?
[13:42:35] <nacin> I have no idea
[13:43:09] <nacin> looks like an example written by someone having no idea what they are doing
[13:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:44:39] <nacin> do you simply want prev/next?
[13:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> No, we want the page numbers as well.
[13:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> At least that's what the designers delivered.
[13:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'm skeptical as to the vaue of ever jumping through paged content.
[13:45:57] <nacin> totally.
[13:46:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on the plugins site right now.
[13:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm personally fine with just using next_posts_link()
[13:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano DaveMethvin gnarf jzaefferer kborchers kswedberg: Any of you want to make the final decision?
[13:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Whether we should show page numbers or just next/prev links on the search/category pages for the plugins site.
[13:50:32] <kborchers> in that instance i don't see an advantage to having the numbers
[13:50:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, page numbers don't seem useful to me
[13:51:35] <DaveMethvin> use the force, Luke, trust your feelings
[13:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Fuck it, ship it.
[14:03:59] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: looks like paginate_links() is a lower-level function and no one has bothered to create a wrapper to use for search/archives
[14:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> Because pagination sucks :-P
[14:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> At least in most forms.
[14:05:28] <ajpiano> ha yea f page numbers
[14:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> There are definitely ways to provide useful pagination, like paging by year or month or letter.
[14:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> Paging by fixed increments is usually worthless.
[14:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Why would /tags/blah/ give a 404 instead of the tags page?
[14:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> If the tag doesn't exist I get a 404, if it does, I get the tags page.
[15:00:30] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: if it doesn't exist why wouldn't you get a 404?
[15:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: When you work on the banner text color for non-webkit can you also look into making to look good when split onto multiple lines?
[15:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Because it's essentially a search page.
[15:00:55] <ryanneufeld> ah
[15:01:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yep
[15:04:20] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: tags that don't exist 404. tags that exist but have no posts 200. tags that exist with posts 200.
[15:05:05] <nacin> if you wanted tags that don't exist to 200, it's doable, but I've never seen it requested.
[15:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> Our tags.php had code for handling tags with no results.
[15:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> But I guess we'll just never run into that situation.
[15:06:07] <nacin> no results means the tag exists but no posts are tagged with it
[15:06:13] <nacin> that's a valid 200
[15:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but it probbly won't happen for us.
[15:06:33] <nacin> probably not, nope.
[15:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll leave that code in.
[15:08:27] <nacin> you have a while ( have_posts() ), so the alternative just means no posts will be shown
[15:08:30] <nacin> probably don't need the code
[15:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> At this point I just want to start deleting stuff.
[15:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather break something that's not ready to deploy than keep around a ton of crufty CSS.
[15:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: So painful. All I was doing is making the tags page use the same styling as the search page. https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/1ed62a3698d8927bed0cc3c06a5630c5232853b6
[16:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Function for getting a post id by URL?
[16:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, finally found it.
[16:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> I knew we had used it before.
[16:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell rxaviers https://groups.google.com/d/topic/nodejs/QDB1ccpG67U/discussion
[16:41:35] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[17:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a hook for replacing content from a post with a function call?
[17:02:13] <scott_gonzalez> Something like the "more..." feature.
[17:07:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see...it's just hardcoded in get_the_content().
[17:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we can hook into the_content filter.
[18:04:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ouch
[18:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> ohhhh.... kborchers is in trouble...
[18:47:56] <kborchers> uh oh, why?
[18:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> topalignmenu.html doesn't have a demo description.
[18:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> I just assume you made the demo.
[18:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm parsing the demos with jsdom to create content for jqueryui.com and it died on that demo :-P
[18:49:30] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i honestly don't remember. i know i have worked on it but don't remember if i originally created it. i'll take the blame though
[18:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> Way to take one for the team :-P
[18:49:48] <kborchers> :)
[18:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add a description.
[18:50:21] <kborchers> ok
[18:50:29] <kborchers> seriously, why does this css SUCK?!?
[18:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, it doesn't even use the .demo wrapper.
[18:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, the CSS is so horrible.
[18:52:34] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i checked history, it was me :/
[18:53:25] <kborchers> though to be fair, i haven't touched it since then which was July of last year and both you and jzaefferer have
[18:53:32] <kborchers> YOUR FAULT, NOT ME!!!
[18:53:33] <kborchers> :P

[19:00:05] <doesallmagic> Scott González: Menu demo: Added demo description.
[19:14:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: if you come back tonight let me know
[19:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers
[19:33:29] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ok, so styling that damn banner on the plugins site
[19:34:18] <kborchers> they used -webkit-background-clip which i'm pretty sure is webkit only without using JS … thoughts on just killing that
[19:35:04] <kborchers> actually even with JS you can just do a decent solid fallback but not the gradient
[19:36:23] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: second, by "make it look good when split on multiple lines" did you mean more responsive font to prevent wrapping or were you talking about the gradient getting messed up which i want to remove anyway
[19:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> I was talking about the gradient getting messed up
[19:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> This is why I was going to just completely redo the styling.
[19:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> It sounds like you've come to the same decision.
[19:39:52] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i mean, that gradient was so subtle anyway, i think it looks fine with just color: #EEE; honestly
[19:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was going to do color + text-shadow.
[19:40:17] <kborchers> ok, i'll do that
[19:41:02] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: also, we're not even using that banner anywhere else right? so i can just put those styles in the plugins theme
[19:41:04] <kborchers> ?
[19:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> We will.
[19:45:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: but will they have the same color? that's what i meant was the color and shadow styles
[19:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they'll all have the same color
[19:46:22] <kborchers> oh, ok
[19:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> https://www.dropbox.com/s/gqjqztc4r70k56i/UI-Home1.png
[19:46:35] <kborchers> cool, i'll put it in base then
[19:47:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gotta go again.
[19:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> LATER
[19:48:16] <kborchers> see ya on the main level
[19:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be on the main level for the rest of the night :-)
[19:48:33] <kborchers> :)
