[01:07:08] <gnarf> FYI Infra people - I've borked our puppet configs and am too tired to actually fix them now, will handle in the morning, shouldn't cause any issues since it can't actually compile, nothing should be being updated by puppet anyway

[09:42:36] <jzaefferer> nacin gnarf: one thing missing to launch qunitjs is the bad category links on the api subsite: http://api.qunitjs.com/ (links on the right) - any ideas where that might be coming from?
[09:43:29] <nacin> is api.qunitjs.com new?
[09:44:52] <nacin> got it.
[09:44:54] <nacin> looking
[09:47:37] <nacin> debugging with some lame var_dumps() on stage, don't mind me
[09:48:17] <nacin> rewrite rules simply needed a flush, jzaefferer. not sure why.
[09:48:43] <nacin> you're good to go, and if it happens on live, we'll fix it there.
[09:49:05] <jzaefferer> nacin: cool, though currently I'm still seeing them on that url
[09:49:19] <jzaefferer> assuming
[09:49:20] <nacin> whoops, I was only fixing it on stage.
[09:49:22] <nacin> you're on prod?
[09:49:23] <jzaefferer> 70.32.120.34 qunitjs.com api.qunitjs.com
[09:49:28] <jzaefferer> yeah, supposed to be prod
[09:49:32] <nacin> one second, then.
[09:49:41] <jzaefferer> these don't exist before, so using this to test prod deployment
[09:49:46] <jzaefferer> which turns out to be a good idea...
[09:50:29] <jzaefferer> actually all the links, not just the categories, go to stage...
[09:50:47] <jzaefferer> like the "asyncTest" entry link
[09:50:49] <jzaefferer> navigation is fine
[09:51:34] <nacin> probably something weird in the DB based on it being a site added recently
[09:52:41] <nacin> :-(
[09:52:48] <nacin> very broken.
[09:53:00] <nacin> it's almost as if someone just manually inserted these tables/rows
[09:57:29] <jzaefferer> nacin: okay, that sounds pretty bad - any clue about the source of that issue?
[09:57:36] <nacin> going through it now.
[09:57:39] <jzaefferer> can we just reinstall the site?
[09:57:47] <nacin> I might have been on the wrong server, so it is not as bad as I thought
[09:58:03] <nacin> :-)
[09:58:11] <jzaefferer> heh, okay
[09:59:01] <nacin> okay, was on the wrong server, but as bad as I thought on the right server, but will have it fixed in just a moment
[10:01:50] <nacin> jzaefferer: all fixed.
[10:02:28] <jzaefferer> nacin: nice!
[10:02:35] <jzaefferer> is that all puppeteered as well?
[10:02:56] <nacin> it was all DB, no code
[10:03:08] <jzaefferer> okay, so it shouldn't happen again?
[10:03:14] <jzaefferer> we'll see I guess :-)
[10:03:16] <nacin> it will — looks like a lot of the sites are borked
[10:03:27] <jzaefferer> oh, okay
[10:03:30] <jzaefferer> well, this is looking good now
[10:03:37] <jzaefferer> will ask gnarf to update the DNS to get this live
[10:03:49] <nacin> we should basically wipe the production DB and do a re-install
[10:03:52] <jzaefferer> we'll have at least one site ready then :-)
[10:04:00] <jzaefferer> okay, that's fine
[10:04:06] <jzaefferer> as long as you recreate the jquery user
[10:04:09] <nacin> aren't some sites live?
[10:04:21] <jzaefferer> I don't know what's going on with other sites
[10:04:22] <jzaefferer> might be
[10:06:06] <nacin> okay. I will talk to rworth when he is around, I guess.
[10:32:00] <gnarf> nacin: yes
[10:32:02] <gnarf> nacin: jquery.com is live
[10:32:04] <gnarf> what needs the reinstall?
[10:32:13] <nacin> gnarf: how was the DB created for prod?
[10:32:20] <gnarf> nacin: install.php
[10:32:30] <nacin> gnarf: really? cause the DB has two things wrong with it
[10:32:33] <gnarf> nacin: drop database wordpress; then going to the website and letting it install
[10:32:45] <nacin> one, all of the URLs are stage.*, which means the config was wrong when the install occurred
[10:32:50] <gnarf> 98% sure
[10:33:11] <gnarf> also 98% sure that the wp-config.php didn't have stage. when I did this
[10:33:18] <gnarf> or rather, stage was set to false
[10:33:30] <gnarf> because I had been testing on that machine for a little bit
[10:33:39] <nacin> it might use JQUERY_STAGING_PREFIX even when JQUERY_STAGING is false. I can fix that.
[10:33:45] <gnarf> nacin: ok
[10:33:53] <gnarf> nacin: i can coordinate a DB wipe with richard
[10:34:03] <gnarf> if you can verify it will fix this issue
[10:34:11] <nacin> we don't need to wipe the DB, I can fix this manually, since things are already live.
[10:34:40] <gnarf> okay
[10:34:43] <gnarf> thats a good thing
[10:35:13] <nacin> digging into this further. looks like the install script may be to blame for the other thing as well. still looking.
[10:41:50] <gnarf> nacin: okay, if you need me to stop into IRC text me or something if I don't respond to ping
[10:43:34] <gnarf> 815.505.4487

[11:48:36] <gnarf> hrm
[13:35:34] <kborchers> nacin Ping
[13:35:49] <nacin> howdy, kborchers
[13:36:06] <kborchers> hey, is there a .htaccess file for local dev on apache that you were working on?
[13:36:16] <nacin> I can drop one into web-base-template
[13:36:21] <kborchers> perfect!
[13:36:24] <kborchers> thanks
[13:41:28] <nacin> gnarf: here?
[13:41:32] <gnarf> yup
[13:41:47] <nacin> can you make sure that JQUERY_STAGING_PREFIX is empty in wp-config.php on production
[13:41:59] <gnarf> in the define?
[13:42:04] <nacin> yeah
[13:42:10] <nacin> define( 'JQUERY_STAGING_PREFIX', '' );
[13:42:13] <gnarf> yes - I can but I thought it was ignored when JQUERY_STAGE was false
[13:42:25] <gnarf> but doing so now
[13:42:30] <nacin> we could also just combine them
[13:42:39] <nacin> define( 'JQUERY_STAGING', false );
[13:42:41] <nacin> define( 'JQUERY_STAGING', 'dev.' );
[13:42:53] <nacin> but that'd break existing dev installs.
[13:43:19] <nacin> gnarf: thanks
[13:46:12] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/647c0b7
[13:46:12] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[13:49:18] <nacin> thanks!
[13:49:25] <nacin> this is mainly to make checks easier.
[13:51:35] <jzaefferer> nacin: I can add my .htaccess to the web-base-template readme, should help kborchers continue
[13:51:57] <nacin> jzaefferer: works for me
[13:52:00] <gnarf> danheberden: you around?
[13:52:11] <nacin> trying to make sure the install script is flawless by the time you guys have a hackathon tonight :-)
[13:52:35] <gnarf> appreciated
[13:52:41] <gnarf> I'm looking to build a VM I can distribute
[13:52:43] <gnarf> actually
[13:52:53] <gnarf> unless kborchers is working on a virtualbox
[13:53:07] <gnarf> kborchers: are you MAMP'n it?
[13:53:14] <gnarf> or are you making a VM to host this?
[13:53:18] <kborchers> gnarf yup
[13:53:22] <gnarf> damn
[13:53:41] <gnarf> nacin: our "dev leads" meeting for this will be in about 1.5 hours
[13:53:52] <gnarf> and that is when we will likely be attacking the hell out of the install script
[13:54:01] <nacin> the install script is now simple enough that it should alleviate the need for a VM, but yeah, apache/mysql can be a pain.
[13:54:08] <gnarf> the "non leads" will prolly not be using these
[13:54:24] <kborchers> i got it working with mamp no problem
[13:54:28] <kborchers> just need the htaccess
[13:54:37] <gnarf> I was just thinking about booting up like 10 clones of my stage environment :)
[13:55:00] <nacin> gnarf: sounds good. I may not be around during that time, but koopersmith is around you somewhere, plus a few people from Automattic including Stephane you met today.
[13:55:00] <gnarf> and rather than distributing them, let everyone use a "local" VM for their team
[13:55:22] <gnarf> aye, Setphane had some great insight
[13:56:12] <jzaefferer> kborchers: .htaccess sample in web-base-template
[13:56:21] <jzaefferer> nacin: if that looks fishy, feel free to fix it up
[13:56:29] <kborchers> jzaefferer thanks … you could have told me since you're sitting next to me
[13:56:35] <nacin> well now I know too
[13:56:40] <kborchers> :)
[13:56:58] <kborchers> but then gnarf would yell at us for being loud
[13:57:00] <gnarf> kborchers: but then I coulda heard it!
[13:57:06] <gnarf> ;)
[13:57:34] <jzaefferer> well, give it a try, my own setup doesn't seem to be working that well
[13:57:42] <jzaefferer> though I get 404 pages from WordPress
[13:57:51] <nacin> I will look at that next
[14:00:08] <jzaefferer> apparently it works for kborchers
[14:00:18] <jzaefferer> so just need to figure out why my own setup is b0rked
[14:03:36] <kborchers> probably because i'm awesome … just a guess though
[14:03:42] <kborchers> jzaefferer ^
[14:03:54] <jzaefferer> dunno about that
[14:06:26] <nacin> jzaefferer: if you are getting 404 pages from WP, but it is actually loading the theme, then it is not .htaccess
[14:06:33] <nacin> go to Settings > Permalinks
[14:06:39] <nacin> visiting that page will make it all work again
[14:07:06] <jzaefferer> uh
[14:07:07] <jzaefferer> okay
[14:07:08] <jzaefferer> that works
[14:07:11] <jzaefferer> but WHY?
[14:07:24] <nacin> WP's internal rewrite rules needed to be flushed. and hitting that page does so.
[14:07:36] <nacin> I think it is related to the install script
[14:07:43] <nacin> (why the rules are broken)
[14:08:36] <jzaefferer> okay
[14:09:08] <jzaefferer> something else is wrong there: my themes keep getting disabled
[14:09:57] <nacin> jzaefferer: that's cause someone renamed the directories a day or two ago
[14:10:05] <nacin> from api-jquery-com to api.jquery.com
[14:14:17] <jzaefferer> oh, okay
[14:14:32] <jzaefferer> so I probably should've just reinstalled everything...
[14:14:44] <nacin> probably.
[14:14:48] <jzaefferer> well, we'll get to a more stable setup :-)
[14:14:57] <jzaefferer> at least one site is live now, qunitjs.com
[14:15:02] <jzaefferer> along with api.qunitjs.com
[14:15:03] <nacin> nice!
[14:15:08] <nacin> jquery.com is also live
[14:15:23] <nacin> the server essentially cares less :)
[14:16:02] <jzaefferer> nice
[14:16:05] <nacin> load average of 0.08, seeing quite a bit of traffic
[14:17:39] <jzaefferer> awesome
[14:17:48] <jzaefferer> so much for WordPress being "slow" :-)
[14:17:55] <jzaefferer> I've met koop earlier
[14:18:12] <jzaefferer> Hope to see you on site next time as well ;)
[14:21:45] <nacin> I'll be out for the next one, for sure
[14:24:06] <nacin> gnarf: so the open file limits reset themselves again, it seems
[14:24:32] <gnarf> ulimit?
[14:24:33] <gnarf> or nginx
[14:24:36] <nacin> ulimit
[14:24:38] <gnarf> i was researching that still
[14:24:45] <gnarf> there is a .conf yu can set
[14:24:52] <nacin> I bumped it back up to 20000, from 1024
[14:24:56] <gnarf> heh
[14:25:07] <nacin> this likely caused the errors this morning
[14:25:15] <gnarf> right
[14:25:20] <nacin> I got a text from rworth asking about the site, but things were fine when I looked.
[14:25:21] <gnarf> I'll make sure thats confed soon
[14:25:31] <nacin> rworth is like my nagios.
[14:25:34] <gnarf> :)
[14:25:51] <gnarf> nacin: I need to write a zabbix test for actual response time and 200/400 case or something
[14:26:00] <gnarf> so it can actually be our "nagios" :)
[14:26:06] <nacin> sounds good.
[14:28:25] <gnarf> closin up for a bit, page if needed ;)
[14:29:09] <nacin> I'll be out for much of the evening, I think
[14:29:17] <nacin> koop knows how to get ahold of me
[14:42:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I don't think I was on this PC when danheberden and I shared that info ;)
[14:45:50] <nacin> fixed everything in the DB.
[14:45:59] <nacin> gnarf: for object caching, you have APC on the server?
[14:49:54] <nacin> we can do a branch of web-base-template that includes an additional web-base-template/object-cache.php file. That file should be this: http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/apc/trunk/object-cache.php
[14:50:03] <nacin> anyway, I'm out for a while.
[15:09:14] <gnarf> nacin: yeah - pretty sure apc is there
[15:09:17] <gnarf> if it isn't i'll add it
