[04:34:47] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tests: Added ability to run tests suites against different versions of jQuery core. - Scott González
[04:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> run tests against latest supported jQuery: /tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html

[04:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> run tests against jQuery's master branch: /tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html?jquery=git
[04:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> that last one requires an internet connection, the others work offline

[07:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> we now have a fully passing 1-8-stable test suite
[07:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> ...by way of deleting all failing tests :-)
[07:21:14] <kborchers> heh
[07:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> well, at least now running the test suite gives you something meaningful
[07:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> any red and you know something is newly broken
[07:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> better than before where we just didn't run the tests since they were pretty much useless

[09:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: you around?
[09:58:39] <rpflo> hey scott_gonzalez
[09:58:40] <bot-t> (15 hours 40 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell rpflo catch me during the day to talk about widget factory
[09:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> ^ what he said :-)
[09:59:24] <rpflo> haha
[09:59:37] <rpflo> I'm heading into a phone call, but I'll be available in 30 mins or so
[09:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> cool, ping me when you're available
[09:59:56] <rpflo> will do, thanks
[10:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: you around?
[10:01:02] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ya kinda
[10:01:16] <danheberden> need view updated?
[10:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> heh, no, wanted to show you the changes for code
[10:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> http://gyazo.com/941e6b2ad09e682fbcf5ac7b837f0398.png
[10:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> thoughts?
[10:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> the other projects just have All {project} Versions
[10:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> but UI was split out into major releases
[10:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> not sure if you wanted to keep it that way
[10:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> actually, now that you mention it...yes, I would like view updated :-)
[10:13:07] <danheberden> haha, dude - whatever you want for that index page is cool
[10:13:12] <danheberden> i just put shit up there to, well, have shit up there
[10:13:20] <danheberden> i like your list
[10:13:43] <danheberden> the thing was, before, i just put everything on the cdn on that page (within reason)
[10:13:57] <danheberden> but since adding all the ui stuff, having every theme 'n past version seemed a bit unneccessary - i like your approach
[10:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> cool, I'll send you the file after I eat lunch
[10:16:50] <gnarf> so, i wonder if my house has internet yet
[10:16:57] <gnarf> kborchers[A]: seems you have power :)
[10:17:21] <gnarf> danheberden: whats up with view on branches?
[10:17:47] <danheberden> gnarf - i think clarkbox did it a bit funky, it's all the branches are sharing the same working tree
[10:17:48] <danheberden> like at once
[10:17:56] <danheberden> i'm trying to update them, but it's getting messy in here
[10:18:00] <gnarf> hrm
[10:18:49] <gnarf> cuz https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/mask/tests/unit/mask/mask_core.js is stil !=== http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/unit/mask/mask_core.js :)
[10:19:01] <danheberden> ya, mask is whats fucking it up
[10:19:10] <gnarf> good to know
[10:19:11] <gnarf> ;)
[10:19:15] <danheberden> somehow there are local changes that git is going ape shit about
[10:19:22] <gnarf> oh
[10:19:24] <gnarf> hrm
[10:19:29] <gnarf> force an update?
[10:19:38] <gnarf> i did push an amended commit
[10:19:39] <kborchers> gnarf: yes i have power. never lost it and unplugged computer/cable modem/etc. before the storms hit last night to avoid losing internet again. you still without power
[10:19:57] <gnarf> kborchers: power was restored about an hour ago, no comcast tho
[10:20:04] <gnarf> kborchers: where u at btw?
[10:20:16] <kborchers> naperville
[10:20:19] <gnarf> right on
[10:20:22] <gnarf> not far
[10:20:22] <gnarf> :)
[10:20:29] <gnarf> should come down to my JS meetup sometime
[10:20:34] <kborchers> nope, not at all
[10:20:43] <kborchers> you do one in rockford or in chicago?
[10:20:46] <gnarf> rockford
[10:20:46] <danheberden> gnarf http://danheberden.com/share/81ae.png
[10:20:56] <danheberden> tried stashing first to see if that'd help, but no
[10:21:01] <kborchers> cool, definitely have to. you get a good crowd?
[10:21:23] <danheberden> gnarf any idea on what to do manually on that branch?
[10:21:43] <gnarf> danheberden: git reset --hard origin/mask ?
[10:21:54] <danheberden> ah, good idea
[10:22:10] <gnarf> this is probably my own fault from amending that initial commit
[10:22:29] <gnarf> i'll remember not to do that in the future, ever again :)
[10:22:37] <gnarf> kborchers: not yet ;)
[10:22:47] <gnarf> kborchers: basically me, and my friend I drag out, and my boss' son
[10:22:51] <gnarf> occasionally a few locals
[10:23:21] <kborchers> gotta start somewhere. i've been thinking about going to some of the meetups in chicago as well
[10:24:08] <gnarf> kborchers: i would think about it too, but, i don't own a car ;)
[10:24:33] <gnarf> and sadly, no passenger rails in rockford
[10:24:36] <kborchers> i guess that's a bit of a barrier ... too bad metra doesn't go all the way out to you
[10:24:39] <kborchers> hah
[10:24:51] <gnarf> gotta get up to harvard
[10:24:56] <gnarf> which is like 30 mi from my house
[10:24:57] <danheberden> gnarf can you check now?
[10:25:03] <danheberden> if it looks the way you expect it to
[10:25:14] <kborchers> yeah, that's a bit of a bike ride ;)
[10:25:18] <gnarf> yup, seems right danheberden
[10:25:25] <gnarf> kborchers: not impossible, I've done it before ;)
[10:25:33] <danheberden> thanks for pointing out the obvious - heh heh
[10:25:33] <gnarf> but yeah, a bit intense for a JS meetup
[10:25:42] <kborchers> right
[10:25:43] <gnarf> itd be like a 5 hour travel
[10:25:53] <gnarf> including train time
[10:26:07] <gnarf> then id have to find a place to stay in chicago
[10:26:22] <gnarf> cuz the last train to harvard is like 9:30pm
[10:26:44] <kborchers> ouch, yeah that's a little much for a meetup
[10:27:05] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/unit/mask/mask.html yay, tested on my droid :)
[10:29:39] <gnarf> yer a lil closer to the city than I am
[10:29:39] <gnarf> ;)
[10:29:53] <gnarf> out of curiosity
[10:30:07] <gnarf> anyone got an iOS Safari to hit that test from?
[10:30:16] <kborchers> yep, one sec
[10:31:09] <kborchers> looks good and all pass on ipad
[10:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah, http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all.html?jquery=git is working now :-)
[10:31:58] <gnarf> hotness scott_gonzalez
[10:32:12] <gnarf> does that work with arbitrary versions too?
[10:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> for master, you can use 1.6, 1.6.1, 1.6.2, git
[10:34:14] <scott_gonzalez> for 1-8-stable, you can use 1.3.2 through 1.5.1 + git
[10:37:18] <rpflo> ping scott_gonzalez
[10:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[10:38:01] <rpflo> Got a few minutes?
[10:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:38:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: var instance = new $.ui.testWidget( {}, elem ); --- options elem, returns instance?
[10:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> still annoys me a bit that it's options first
[10:38:43] <rpflo> So, to set some context, I come from MooTools, and jQuery.widget is actually like a very specific MooTools "Class"
[10:38:59] <rpflo> And, I think it's awesome.
[10:39:05] <gnarf> for testing the private methods, you think its better to rip the .data() out, or should i use that method?
[10:40:02] <rpflo> The only issue I really have about it is the event system, I don't like the names of the events, and that you have to route them through the element.
[10:40:24] <rpflo> el.bind('slideshowcomplete', fn) ... yuck
[10:40:27] <jzaefferer> btw rpflo, support for event delegation in _bind is to close to landing in master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/372
[10:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> rpflo: what would you rather have?
[10:42:14] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: to me, the events are part of the constructor instance, not the element.
[10:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> but UI is all about the DOM
[10:42:44] <rpflo> Say you have an accordion inside an accordion (I know gross)
[10:42:56] <rpflo> and you have an event attached to the parent accordion
[10:43:07] <rpflo> the child accordion's event bubbles up to it
[10:43:17] <rpflo> so you have to add an event to the child accordion also just to stop it
[10:43:26] <rpflo> the event there is very different from a dom event
[10:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> or just check $( event.target ).closest( ".ui-accordion" )
[10:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> the same thing happens in real DOM events
[10:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> if you click on something, it's gonna bubble
[10:44:15] <rpflo> Crap, boss on phone
[10:44:17] <rpflo> brb
[10:46:51] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez gnarf ping me if you don't see the view site updating after 5 minutes - i re-setup the cron for clarkbox so i think we're golden now
[10:48:27] <gnarf> danheberden: roger, the mask issue was prolly my fault btw
[10:48:44] * gnarf apologizes for making you scratch head that long
[10:48:52] <danheberden> well it wasn't setup to handle head changes, no biggies
[10:49:04] <danheberden> i had that same issue, kinda, on the learn site pull tool
[11:00:00] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: back
[11:01:12] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: So, I guess I still view the contructor instances as just objects with events, separate from the DOM, I can fold on routing the events through the element, I can see the argument.
[11:02:00] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: as for the names ... any reason not to separate them with a colon or something for readability?
[11:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> what if you could opt-in to having the events on the instance instead of the element?
[11:02:13] <rpflo> el.bind('widget:event', fn)
[11:02:26] <rpflo> scott_gonzalez: I'd love that.
[11:02:41] <rpflo> some events are "DOM-ish" ... others are "instance-ish"
[11:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> to be honest, it's back-compat
[11:03:02] <rpflo> would be cool to have some sort of way to control which kind of event you want
[11:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> 1.0 had a specific convention
[11:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> widget:event would actually solve problems that we have
[11:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> with event name collisions
[11:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> resize -> resizable:resize
[11:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> drag -> draggable:drag
[11:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> would drop eventPrefix in that case
[11:04:34] <rpflo> the other weird thing about widget events tied to element events is inheritance
[11:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> got an example of that?
[11:05:16] <rpflo> the event name changes as the widget name changes
[11:05:20] <rpflo> like I've got .slideshow
[11:05:23] <rpflo> and .slideshownav
[11:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> btw, if you set defaultElement to null, you'll get events on the instance instead of the element
[11:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> that's intended
[11:06:04] <rpflo> since event are routed through the element, it's slideshownavcomplete now instead of slideshowcomplete ... where if the events were just on the instance the event would simiply be 'complete'
[11:06:18] <rpflo> I know it's intended, and necessary when routing through the element.
[11:06:29] <jzaefferer> also, you can set the widgetEventPrefix back to that of the parent, doing that for the inheriting datasources in grid
[11:07:08] <rpflo> tell me about defaultElement, how would that work?
[11:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> defaultElement allows you to create elements if you instantiate a widget without one
[11:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> new $.rp.slideshow( options )
[11:09:48] <rpflo> interesting, I'll have to play with that
[11:10:20] <rpflo> so seriously, now that there's callSuper and applySuper, I'm really happy with .widget
[11:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> in master, there's this line:
[11:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> element = $( element || this.defaultElement || this )[ 0 ];
[11:10:35] <rpflo> If the event names had were widget:type, I'd have zero complaints I think
[11:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> we can seriously consider that
[11:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> because we've got 2 big problems right now
[11:11:05] <rpflo> it's hard to document and read 'slideshowshowcomplete'
[11:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> 1) drag events overlap with HTML5 drag events
[11:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> 2) jQuery 1.6 bubbles events all the way to the window, causing issues with $( window ).resize() and resizable elements
[11:12:54] <rpflo> opt-in to custom event bubbling, or opt-in to instance events would be great too.
[11:13:03] <rpflo> or opt-out to custom event bubbling
[11:13:17] <rpflo> but that's jQuery, not UI
[11:13:45] <rpflo> In the mean time, I'm thinking of building a little instance event mixin for widgets.
[11:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> should be easy
[11:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> just proxy $.Wiget.prototype._trigger
[11:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> if you have events on instances, how would you listen to all instances?
[11:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> bubble from the instance to the prototype?
[11:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> lots of extensions are written based on event bubbling
[11:17:29] <rpflo> I've written some pretty complex stuff, not sure that I've ever needed to listen to all instances of a contructor, but there's probably a chance you'd show me where I could have and it would blow my mind.
[11:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> for example: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/master/autocomplete/jquery.ui.autocomplete.selectFirst.js
[11:44:31] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: reruns no worky for jquery=git: http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/all.html?jquery=git&filter=accordion%2Faccordion.html%3Fjquery%3Dgit
[11:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> hah
[11:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll fix it
[11:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> oh god, that's gonna be painful
[11:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> at first I thought it was just the fact that there was no & between the params
[11:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> but the problem is the test name is wrong
[11:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...maybe not
[11:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[11:50:23] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/61caba7803d1c3885a8e2a6cd3c1e8b723e8beee
[11:50:23] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/master] Tests: Fixed param parsing for compound test suites. - Scott González
[12:06:39] <jzaefferer> that wasn't so bad :-)
[12:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> yup, just had to make sure we don't pass the filter down from the parent to the chidl
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> since it'll never match
[12:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> if we add more hooks to QUnit, we can make this awesome
[12:08:23] <scott_gonzalez> if we could actually proxy the modules and tests
[12:08:55] <jzaefferer> is there an easy way to compare a branch in a fork to its origin on github?
[12:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> all of the module and test registration has to happen synchronously, right?
[12:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/mask
[12:11:21] <jzaefferer> mhm
[12:12:08] <scott_gonzalez> you can also explicitly compare two branches
[12:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/1.8.14...1-8-stable
[12:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> things in 1-8-stable since 1.8.14 :-)
[12:12:26] <jzaefferer> nice
[12:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> hah: Showing 56 changed files with 62,565 additions and 1,410 deletions.
[12:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> that's right... 62 THOUSAND additions
[12:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> 61,676 of them are from a single commit
[12:13:30] <jzaefferer> 1.5 doubled compared to 1.3
[12:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, jQuery grows a lot with each release
[12:14:16] <kborchers> that huge commit must have been to fix some IE bug ;)
[12:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:23:08] <jzaefferer> I'd like to land the widget-delegation stuff, if someone wants to review: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/372/files
[12:23:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, kborchers, gnarf, rworth, any comments?
[12:26:10] <rworth> I've never liked "eventname selector" syntax but I don't have anything better to offer, and it's becoming common-ish
[12:28:47] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/a57c43525786712207f8067df68045c2c33c1e04/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L316
[12:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> does that need to be $( event.target ) now?
[12:32:28] <kborchers> maybe i'm just not seeing it but how are you handling the disabled option in those events in menu?
[12:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: it's magic
[12:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> _bind() does the check for you
[12:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> _bind will do a disabled check and set the context of the handler to the plugin instance
[12:34:26] <kborchers> cool! i think that looks good then. really cleans up all of those handlers in menu :D
[12:35:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding the $(this).is(.disabled) check - inside the delegate callback, this refers to the target we care about (this === event.currentTarget), while event.target can be something else - I think its correct as-is
[12:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right
[12:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> I WRITE FUTURE PROOF CODE!
[12:36:18] <jzaefferer> kborchers: even without delegation we could've used _bind
[12:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm like David Mark
[12:36:49] <kborchers> learn something every day
[12:36:54] <jzaefferer> like the focus and blur handlers could be used already
[12:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> my code works in theoretical versions of jQuery UI that don't yet exist
[12:37:14] <kborchers> right, that makes sense
[12:39:55] <gnarf> jzaefferer: seems pretty solid, although I'm kinda agreeing with rworth's dislike of "click selector"
[12:40:12] <gnarf> and definitely agreeing that i have nothing better to offer
[12:45:37] <gnarf> i don't like it because then we can't bind "input paste": sameFunc
[12:45:57] <gnarf> maybe we already can't
[12:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> well, it just requires two lines:
[12:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> this._bind({ "input": handler, "paste": handler })
[12:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> unless we get into defining our own syntax, but I don't think it's worth it
[12:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> "(input paste) foo bar"
[12:53:12] <jzaefferer> binding multiple events at once isn't enough of a concern really - the one weak spot is where you have a event or selector configurable via an option
[12:53:22] <gnarf> "input;element a"
[12:53:24] <jzaefferer> its already bad for event options
[12:53:42] <jzaefferer> but thats really rare, and the one case we have, accordion, shouldn't even exist
[12:54:01] <gnarf> :)
[12:54:12] <jzaefferer> tooltip has configurable selector, but tooltip is weird/fancy and can't use _bind anyway
[12:54:50] <jzaefferer> I've used Backbone with the same style for delegation for half a year, I like it
[12:55:05] <jzaefferer> yet Backbone.View has all kinds of issues, I'd be happy to replace it with $.widget...
[12:55:54] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to widget-delegation: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/0ff3396e8853d1858db56e4ad7552f87c09e5504

[12:55:57] <jzaefferer> fixed the one issue scott commented on
[13:29:16] <gnarf> hrm
[13:29:36] <gnarf> trying to figure out where to stick this array of "definitions" for mask
[13:29:40] <gnarf> or rather object
[13:29:48] <gnarf> (sorry, been in PHP too much today ;))
[13:30:08] <gnarf> should I put it on $.ui.mask.definititions, make it configurable per instance?
[13:30:17] <gnarf> that way you could pass your own definition in?
[13:36:17] <peol> +1
[13:41:16] <gnarf> how can you +1 an "or" ? :)
[13:42:58] <gnarf> I'm also trying to think about handling a "hh:mm:ss" mask
[13:43:12] <gnarf> where mm/ss only allow 00-59
[13:43:14] <gnarf> etc
[13:45:19] <rworth> gnarf: you could do both
[13:45:41] <gnarf> rworth: no real reason to have the "global" one if i stick it in defaults right?
[13:45:55] <gnarf> like it gets extended right?
[13:46:08] <rworth> oh yeah, I guess what I was going to suggest already happens
[13:51:50] <gnarf> i think i have a way to support hh:mm:ss and mm/dd/yy type stuff
[13:52:10] <gnarf> along with being able to do 5(right)2780 to get 05/27/80
[13:52:41] <gnarf> at least the theory in my mind is working
[13:52:55] <rworth> everything's working in my mind ;)
[13:53:12] <rworth> in David Mark's too
[13:53:14] <gnarf> yup
[13:53:27] <gnarf> finding the path in the mind is the first step tho
[13:53:27] <gnarf> :)
[13:53:47] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/2t1D003S3I1X2J280B2N
[13:55:37] <gnarf> an "undefined" return means invalid char
[14:05:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: would you say these are flipping correctly (looked better in my local test but should get the idea) http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/FwmHP/ ?
[14:05:27] <kborchers> any other situations to check?
[14:33:14] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez can you take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/FwmHP/ when you get a chance and let me know if there are other situations i need to check for flip? thanks
[14:33:15] <bot-t> kborchers, Okay.
[14:33:18] <kborchers> heading out
