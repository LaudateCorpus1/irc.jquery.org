[06:18:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yo
[06:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> yo
[06:18:26] <kborchers> so how important is it that the border bug is fixed? :P
[06:18:34] <kborchers> pretty sure it's the borders causing that jump
[06:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[06:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> Give me a few minutes to wrap something up.
[06:20:17] <kborchers> i did some playing around with removing borders and almost got rid of it
[06:20:18] <kborchers> ok
[06:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'm ready.
[07:00:01] <kborchers> ok, about to jump into a meeting. like i said, i think the issue may be with the borders not taken into account with the animation calculations. i could be wrong but it seemed like i could almost get rid of the jump when i messed around with removing borders in chrome dev tools last night.
[07:00:14] <kborchers> i may have also been imagining it because it was driving me crazy
[07:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, ok, I'll see what's going on
[07:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Even removing the accordion stylesheet, the animation isn't smooth in Firefox.
[07:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Why does Mozilla suck at building dev tools?
[07:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> The new web console seems like a piece of crap.
[07:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> How have they not obsoleted Firebug by now?
[07:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> FML .outerHeight() always return integers.
[08:31:36] <kborchers> i think i am going to change professions ... house-husband sounds really nice right now :P
[09:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like Firefox doesn't allow fractional values for borders.
[09:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think I found another change to make in the stylesheet, but it doesn't help Firefox.

[09:54:24] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Accordion: Simplify CSS so content panels never have a top border instead of toggling the bottom border of the headers.
[10:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> damn, the animations are better in master than in accordion-animation in IE 9 :-/
[10:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> So we're gotten better in Chrome, Opera IE 6, about the same in Firefox, worse in IE 9.
[10:20:39] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: this is miserable :(  it reminds me of when i was trying to fix that button bug and since FF doesn't follow the box model with buttons it never worked out so that all browsers looked right/same
[10:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> I hate this problem.
[10:22:09] <kborchers> require accordions be put in a div with overflow: hidden;
[10:22:10] <kborchers> ?cc
[10:22:10] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we may do that during animation just to avoid the flickering below
[10:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> It won't fix the jumping inside the accordion, but it would keep the rest of the page clean.
[10:26:32] <kborchers> yeah, i was going for the rest of the page issue with that ... and was kind of joking but if you're cool with it i'm in :P
[10:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> We've talked about it a few times. If we can't get this to work in all browsers, we might have to actually do it :-/
[10:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> We can just set the height on the accordion element itself before the animation, and then revert it after.
[10:27:55] <kborchers> yeah
[10:28:01] <kborchers> as for the internal flicker, it really wasn't that bad for me.
[10:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf also suggested just setting the height on creation.
[10:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's not too bad.
[10:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> People mostly complain about the content below.
[10:28:27] <kborchers> yep
[10:28:55] <kborchers> wouldn't gnarf's suggestion mess with the non fixed height accordions though?
[10:29:06] <kborchers> what ever that option is called
[10:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we would need to do it based on that option.
[10:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> And we'd need to account for that whenever the option is changed.
[10:29:31] <kborchers> right

[12:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> Print out a large copy of the logo and take it to the shooting range :-)
[12:12:37] <kborchers> YES!
[12:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> All browser logos are designed like targets anyway :-)
[12:13:04] <kborchers> seriously though, WTF? http://gyazo.com/d35d894a982de0fc4b9dca31bb5d0206
[12:13:30] <kborchers> triggering an extra focus event for some reason
[12:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> Hah. IE does sync + async focus
[12:14:32] <kborchers> i think i need to just find a way to rewrite those tests without using the focus event ... fun
[12:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> When I finish this round of animation insanity, I'll take a look at the tests.
[12:15:58] <kborchers> thanks. i'll let you know if i come up with something before then

[12:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> Look at all that red!
[12:52:25] <kborchers> nice!
[13:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I just realized I've been changing the wrong test for menu.
[13:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> I thought the browser was using some sort of super cache.
[13:05:39] <kborchers> doh!
[13:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> yo dawg, I heard you like timeouts. :-P
[13:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> Before I tell you how to fix this, I need to ask you a question about the first assertion...
[13:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> You simulate down, down, but you expect 3 different indexes.
[13:14:03] <scott_gonzalez> Is that because of the focus?
[13:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> Or is that because that's what got the test passing?
[13:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> Meaning, is that actually the expected behavior because focusing the menu is supposed to focus the first item.
[13:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like that's expected behavior, I just want to make sure.
[13:18:35] <kborchers> heh ... timeouts :)
[13:18:41] <kborchers> and yes, that is expected with the focus
[13:19:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok.
[13:20:04] <scott_gonzalez> 3
[13:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> 2

[13:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> ?boom
[13:20:08] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[13:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> That diff is a bit hard to follow because of whitespace.
[13:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> I just wrapped everything after the first assertion in a timeout.
[13:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> The focus occurs, then we simulate two keydowns, then we do an assertion.
[13:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> Before moving on, we pause to let the async focus event fire in IE.
[13:22:08] <kborchers> ooohhh, i see
[13:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> Menu just passed in IE 8 on TestSwarm
[13:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:22:49] <kborchers> SWEET! Thanks!
[13:22:53] <kborchers> all of those timeouts suck ... is there a better way to deal with the delayed opening of the submenus
[13:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> No, but there's a better way to structure the tests :-)
[13:23:44] <kborchers> i am all ears! this was my first attempt at qunit thus the ugliness
[13:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/tabs/tabs_events.js#L253
[13:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just name the functions for the timeouts, so you can remove all the nesting.
[13:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs doesn't have timeouts in the tests, but those events are async.
[13:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice the bottom of each tabsload event handler just calls the next set of actions.
[13:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, IE 6 is so much slower at running tests than IE 8.
[13:26:12] <kborchers> oh, i get it. _MUCH_ cleaner!
[13:26:29] <kborchers> i will redo those tests like that

[13:27:37] <kborchers> stupid headless tests

[13:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> It may have reached the limit?
[13:27:48] <clarkbox> sending that to browserstack
[13:28:36] <scott_gonzalez> And here's the actual test run that died: http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=4549&client_id=7735
[13:28:44] <kborchers> i guess we'll see if it comes back around and cleans that up
[13:28:53] <clarkbox> it will not
[13:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, it's looking really good: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/754/
[13:29:05] <kborchers> yep
[13:29:19] <clarkbox> i have browserstack only run tests that have never been run
[13:29:25] <kborchers> clarkbox: no? i thought i saw it happen yesterday
[13:29:33] <clarkbox> we may be changing that
[13:29:42] <clarkbox> it may have been another client?
[13:29:47] <clarkbox> not a browserstack one
[13:29:50] <kborchers> oh, yeah. that makes sense
[13:30:16] * kborchers fires up browserstack with IE6 to fix that test ;)

[13:33:09] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, we might get a green build.
[13:34:30] <kborchers> DON'T JINX IT!!!
[13:34:48] <kborchers> damn it scott!
[13:34:55] <kborchers> :P
[13:35:28] <kborchers> that's weird!, you see it keep erroring?
[13:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, was reading a bug report.
[13:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yt?
[13:35:50] <kborchers> still doing it
[13:36:01] <kborchers> IE6 on tabs
[13:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I see it.
[13:36:47] <scott_gonzalez> It looks like a BrowserStack client.
[13:36:59] <kborchers> running manually now
[13:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> Which is strange because the failure looks like a focus issue.
[13:37:24] <kborchers> what?!?!
[13:37:27] <kborchers> IE7
[13:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf gnarf
[13:37:38] <kborchers> lolololol
[13:37:54] <gnarf> yeah
[13:38:03] <gnarf> watched it error
[13:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8112
[13:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> worksforme?
[13:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like "ugly" is expected for all UI effects.
[13:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> .show( "slide" ) is intentionally different from .slideDown/Up()
[13:39:17] <kborchers> wait for it .......
[13:40:09] <kborchers> oh come on
[13:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:40:20] <gnarf> hrm
[13:40:41] <gnarf> well i think this effect is meant to have content sliding down from above
[13:40:57] <gnarf> the wrapper is at "full height" during that
[13:41:05] <gnarf> not sure if it should be
[13:41:20] <gnarf> most of the ui effects kind of assume aboslute positioning
[13:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..I was thinking it needed to be, but I guess it doesn't
[13:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[13:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> ALL GREEN!
[13:42:01] <kborchers> yes!
[13:42:17] <kborchers> come on jq-jenkins ... you're so quick to yell failure!
[13:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> It already yelled failure for this job.
[13:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> So it won't say that it passed now.
[13:43:01] <kborchers> jerk
[13:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> jerk-jenkins :-P
[13:43:16] <kborchers> jq-jerkins
[13:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ok, I'll leave it open for you to think about :-)
[13:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> I wish the Trac ticket graph included today.
[19:41:17] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: you still around?
[19:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> maybe :-P
[19:41:47] <kborchers> just wondering if you could take a quick glance at this to make sure i am doing it right before i change the rest https://github.com/kborchers/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/menu/menu_events.js#L197
[19:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that looks good, though you can decrease all the timeouts to 50
[19:43:07] <kborchers> oh yeah, duh
[19:43:09] <kborchers> thanks
[19:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
