[00:15:00] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #627: STILL UNSTABLE in 18 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/627/
[05:34:08] <tj_vantoll> hmmmm grunt uglify:i18n fails in the jquery-ui repo and I'm not sure why.
[05:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Worked for me. Checking to make sure I've got up-to-date dependencies.
[05:41:14] <tj_vantoll> Yeah just npm install'd and I get Warning: Uglification failed
[05:41:51] <tj_vantoll> grunt uglify:main works fine
[06:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> node -v?
[06:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, got distracted by other stuff while npm was installing modules.
[06:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> It worked for me on a clean npm install.
[06:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> node v0.10.32
[06:06:54] <tj_vantoll> I'm a bit behind. I'll try updating.
[06:07:52] <tj_vantoll> Still fails on 0.10.33
[06:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Try `rm -rf node_modules`?
[06:27:07] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15tjvantoll reopened pull request #1380: Sortable: Append a tr with td to the placeholder of tbody elements (06master...06tbody_placeholder) 02http://git.io/nGQWFw
[06:36:44] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Still no luck. Very odd.
[06:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not sure how else to debug this.
[06:36:58] <tj_vantoll> I wonder if others are seeing this or if it's just me.
[06:37:12] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: what do you need tried
[06:37:13] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: Around?
[06:37:17] <arschmitz> :)
[06:37:19] <tj_vantoll> arschmitz: good timing :)
[06:37:39] <tj_vantoll> In the UI repo can you try running grunt uglify:i18n
[06:37:44] <arschmitz> sure
[06:40:06] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: i got the error
[06:40:51] <tj_vantoll> Thanks. So now the question is what's scott_gonzalez doing differently :)
[06:40:57] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: scott_gonzalez: i also rm -rf node modules and npm install
[06:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's make sure we ended up with the same dependencies.
[06:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/04386e1ac1d1d466c5b1
[06:41:56] <tj_vantoll> Also I find grunt tasks incredibly difficult to debug so I'm not sure what the error is.
[06:42:33] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: What are you running to generate that?
[06:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> npm ls | pbcopy
[06:43:30] <tj_vantoll> identical for me
[06:44:16] <arschmitz> same here
[06:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> Weird. I've got no ideas then.
[06:46:46] <tj_vantoll> If I create the dist/i18n/jquery-ui-i18n.js file the task runs.
[06:46:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: tj_vantoll: its saying there is no sourse
[06:47:19] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/5b24656dfd7708ec0fed
[06:47:42] <arschmitz> source 
[06:48:03] <tj_vantoll> It seems that it depends on the concat task.
[06:49:19] <tj_vantoll> Should be easy enough to make sure uglify depends on concat.
[06:49:41] <tj_vantoll> Although this isn't really that big of a deal.
[06:49:48] <tj_vantoll> Thanks guys.
[06:52:31] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: no problem that was a quick and fairly simple one :)

[08:39:49] <scott_gonzalez> lisa_deluca: Make sure to search for uses of the icon too, because I think we might use one of the caret icons in a demo or two.
[08:40:27] <lisa_deluca> scott_gonzalez: yea, i'm not allowed to contribute to the demos/ directories.  so I've got the jQM changes for all but the demos

[10:25:11] <arschmitz> jasperdegroot: other then not checking to make sure they actually deployed no
[10:25:17] <arschmitz> it was a problem with the server

[10:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> lisa_deluca: Thanks, that looks good. A few comments though (I'll fix these myself when I merge):
[10:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ref, not Refs, and this should actually have been Fixes anyway.
[10:37:52] <lisa_deluca> scott_gonzalez: I didn't push the demo updates though so I didn't want it to close it out without those fixes
[10:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we're actually keying anything off of Ref though, so that wouldn't be an issue.
[10:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> There were no demo references that I saw.
[10:38:24] <lisa_deluca> scott_gonzalez: ah, okay
[10:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> And Spelling is not a component ;-)
[10:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> Also, no periods in short description.
[10:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> There's also a stray space at the beginning of the Ref line, which I believe would actually cause problems for our scripts.
