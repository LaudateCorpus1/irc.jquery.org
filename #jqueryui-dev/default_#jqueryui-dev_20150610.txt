[00:05:39] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - compat-git core build #903: STILL UNSTABLE in 13 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20compat-git%20core/903/
[00:15:08] <ArkoEWD> Good morning. I have two containers that I have both draggable and droppable on applied. However, whenever I drag one item from list A to list B, I can't drag it back from list B to list A. I have seen some liveDraggable() functions on stackoverflow, but live() is not supported anymore on the latest jQuery versions.
[00:15:13] <ArkoEWD> Are there any other solutions to this?

[07:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did you see https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/6ce448b33cf8afe23646d548fe9bb0fd7a550435#commitcomment-11268223?
[07:03:11] <arschmitz> Yeah when i updated that pr you were in the middle of reviewing and all i did was squash one commit
[07:03:24] <arschmitz> because it fixed basicly everythign you were commenting about
[07:03:38] <arschmitz> that was just apparently the one thing
[07:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[07:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I'm going to just stop commenting on style issues. We just need to get JSCS updated so it's working properly.
[07:21:11] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: did you see my comment?
[07:21:16] <arschmitz> we dont run jscs against tests
[07:21:21] <arschmitz> im going to add the ones i work on in that pr
[07:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, really?
[07:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> That's silly.
[07:21:47] <arschmitz> yup
[07:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely do that.
[07:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> WE DO IT AT WORK!
[07:21:59] <arschmitz> lol
[07:22:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: What's up with https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/66097638#L306?
[07:23:02] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: cgack broke it!
[07:23:05] <arschmitz> :-p
[07:23:10] <gabriel_schulhof> :)
[07:23:15] <arschmitz> rebase mistake landing rangeslider
[07:23:28] <arschmitz> hes on top of it
[08:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you run the meeting today?
[08:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm in a meeting that's running long.
[11:55:44] <onodera> hello, is it possible to combine multiple effects?
[11:56:06] <onodera> I want to conbine scale and clip to get something like this: https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/372480/screenshots/2057963/ikano.gif
[12:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Did your head explode writing these tests? https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-ui/commit/591a3eca16c6974a3a125341f2aea6a355bfdd04#diff-5722f4972dfbe81426af161d84d86985R85
[12:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> Because my head is exploding just reading them.
[12:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> You'd think something as simple as passing through a boolean wouldn't have so many cases.
[12:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing is ever as simple as you'd think :-P
[12:32:55] <arschmitz> ha ha 
[12:33:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:33:15] <arschmitz> and each one has potential differences in the code path
[12:33:23] <arschmitz> so i wanted to make sure to test each one
[12:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> onodera: You can't combine them, but in 1.12 (and in master), you can use a custom clip animation.
[12:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> That animation looks like it's just a clip that converges on the center point.
[12:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> Though it's only coming in to about 25% horizontally.
[12:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> So not quite the center pont.
[12:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> s/pont/point/
[12:39:51] <onodera> 3>you can use a custom clip animation
[12:40:13] <onodera> can you please explain how, or can you link me some resource that tells me how?
[12:41:54] <apsdehal> onodera: This is not the right place to ask, support is at #jquery
[12:42:51] <onodera> oh I am sorry I missread something on the support page
[12:43:09] <onodera> I already thougt that the -dev prefix was kinda weird lol
[12:43:21] <onodera> *suffic
[13:12:36] <onodera> where can I grab a 1.12/master build?
[13:38:16] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: When you get a chance, could you please add the missing stuff back into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/8141?
[14:40:14] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: oh shoot yeah i kinda blew that up lol
[14:48:06] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: NP! Whenever you get a chance ...
