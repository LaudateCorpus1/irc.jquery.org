[05:49:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:51:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on that firefox iframe issue have you opened an issue on bugzilla or seen if there is already one?
[05:54:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No.
[05:54:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good point though.
[05:55:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I should check.
[05:55:42] <arschmitz> we need to do that for firefox issues we have mike taylor who will try to fast track fixes if we do
[05:56:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im done with demos-nav
[05:58:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make a test page.
[05:59:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome thank you
[06:03:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've filed the bug (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=927842) but I have not added the test page yet.

[07:55:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thanks
[07:55:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will take a look at the style and merge in master
[07:56:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: style actually didnt end up too bad
[07:56:30] <arschmitz> only thing i really noticed besides you maybe wanting to adjust colors and stuff is key word over flow in the panel
[07:57:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I see that
[07:57:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: would also be nice if the search input gets focus when you open the panel
[07:57:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can do that

[08:31:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: global nav doesn't work for me local
[08:33:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like you didn't add ../ to the href
[08:35:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll do that
[08:38:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I also noticed that search results keywords are appended multiple times
[08:52:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll fix that too ^^
[09:18:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hold on on global nav because it was working for me
[09:18:32] <arschmitz> maybe i broke somehting when i cleaned up js
[09:20:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ohhhh that was a merge conflict 
[09:20:43] <arschmitz> i didnt fix correctly
[09:20:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what did you merge?
[09:20:54] <arschmitz> you had made a change
[09:21:02] <arschmitz> to jqm-contents
[09:21:19] <arschmitz> and i forgot i had added that and just took your copy
[09:21:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, gotcha
[09:21:38] <uGoMobi> I added it back and it's working now
[09:22:21] <arschmitz> yeah the code was there to remove it and when i did all my testing it was there but then i merged right before i commited and lost it
[09:23:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Re: the search keywords... I used .one() instead of .on() to bind the handler to pagecreate, then the problem is gone
[09:23:39] <arschmitz> ok cool
[09:23:52] <arschmitz> i wonder if it always did that
[09:23:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just wondering, all links have data-ajax="false" so it seems to me we create the search list again for each page
[09:23:57] <arschmitz> because that was always there
[09:24:17] <arschmitz> yes
[09:24:29] <arschmitz> we do
[09:25:01] <uGoMobi> so I don't understand why it didn't work correctly with .on()
[09:25:20] <arschmitz> i have no idea
[09:25:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you happen to notice it after using back button
[09:25:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[09:25:56] <arschmitz> because there is the bug that back button always uses ajax
[09:26:00] <arschmitz> hmmm ok
[09:26:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just used a link in the search results panel to nav to another page and then opened search again
[09:27:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then the keywords are appended again
[09:28:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am now looking into the search list icon
[09:28:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we set it to false but still it's there :(
[09:29:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nevermind, got it
[09:29:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in the extension it wasn't set to false
[09:30:32] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:31:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually all those options should not even be listed in extension
[09:31:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: only the four added options should
[09:31:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, deleted the others
[09:32:00] <arschmitz> cool
[09:34:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually I do need to set icon: false there
[09:35:14] <uGoMobi> maybe because it isn't the default value
[09:36:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:57:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Is the meeting in an hour?
[09:57:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[09:58:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you in a different time zone?
[09:58:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or is it wintertime already in some parts of the world?
[09:58:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, but I know that in North America they switch the clocks like two weeks earlier or later or something like that.
[09:59:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The difference between your time zone and mine is always an hour.
[10:00:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nov 3rd
[10:01:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's great! Now, if only I knew when we're doing the switch :)
[10:02:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol ill be in amsterdam when time switches her
[10:02:20] <arschmitz> here
[10:04:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for you and me the clock changes on Oct 27
[10:04:53] <uGoMobi> so there is only one week in between this year
[10:07:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[10:08:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[10:08:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[10:08:27] <uGoMobi> I see I wrote "wintertime", that's Dutch English lol
[10:08:45] <uGoMobi> anyway, DST i mean
[10:12:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Whatever ... I never know which one's which :) ... I just know that it switches around this time.

[12:40:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #6622: Grunticon demo page  02http://git.io/5U-W4g
[12:51:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: im looking at that im a little perplexed by it
[12:52:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: here I changed trigger("create") to enhanceWithin()... http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/651/edit
[12:52:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i did the same already
[12:52:49] <arschmitz> and it still does not work
[12:52:55] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:53:03] <arschmitz> but enhance within is what does all our enhancment
[12:53:11] <arschmitz> and it works fine with toolbars
[12:53:18] <arschmitz> so im perplexed as to the cause
[12:54:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: refresh that JS Bin
[12:54:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : you have to enhance the popup yourself
[12:54:45] <uGoMobi> because it's injected on pageshow
[12:54:56] <uGoMobi> so it's basically the same as a popup outside page
[12:55:09] <arschmitz> right but the popup was working
[12:55:18] <arschmitz> why were toolbars not enhanced
[12:56:05] <arschmitz> because they are enhancing the contianer the popup was in
[12:56:12] <arschmitz> this should all be handled by enhancewithin
[12:57:11] <arschmitz> and triggering create just calls enhanceWithin

[13:07:14] <arschmitz> ok
[13:10:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it seems to be a toolbar specific issue
[13:10:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/653/edit
[13:10:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: input button is enhanced
[13:11:14] <arschmitz> yeah something very weird going on
[13:11:15] <uGoMobi> just tested that because <button> doesn't use a widget
[13:19:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its only headers and footers inside popup
[13:20:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: header or footer not in a popup work fine
[13:28:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: figured it out
[13:28:36] <arschmitz> anything that comes alphabetically after popup does not work
[13:28:48] <arschmitz> because the popup relocates itself on create
[13:29:19] <arschmitz> so enhancewithin when it runs its selectors on the container finds nothing inside popup because its been moved
[13:32:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we have to rename the widget to "oolbar"?
[13:33:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 
[13:33:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: I'll look into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621 now ...
[13:33:22] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (2h 20m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[13:33:26] <_|Nix|_> Oh, NM.
[13:33:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so tables and tabs dont work either
[13:34:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ...
[13:34:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 
[13:34:44] <_|Nix|_> That should also be true for static then ...
[13:34:56] <_|Nix|_> No, wait.
[13:34:56] <arschmitz> i was just thinking that
[13:35:11] <_|Nix|_> It's not true for static, because the page gets traversed for each widget.
[13:35:30] <_|Nix|_> So, as long as the popup stays inside the page, it will be traversed.
[13:35:46] <arschmitz> right but why is it different in the dynamic case?
[13:36:03] <arschmitz> isnt the popup moved outside page?
[13:36:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No.
[13:36:19] <_|Nix|_> It's appended to the end of the page.
[13:36:27] <arschmitz> oh its in page just moved from where it is
[13:37:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6621 it's not working because you invoke enhanceWithin on the div that encloses everything, but the popup moves to become the last child of the nearest page, which is the parent of that injected <div>.
[13:37:10] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6621 by H2Os (2h 24m ago): Dynamically injected popup with header/footer not enhanced properly
[13:37:23] <arschmitz> maybe we should move popup on open
[13:37:26] <arschmitz> not create
[13:38:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... not bad. At that point we could solve all the z-order issues too.
[13:38:19] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:38:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Make popup the last child of the body while it's open.
[13:38:31] <arschmitz> exactly
[13:39:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not bad ... I leave a placeholder div where the popup used to be, so I can just re-insert it before the placeholder.
[13:39:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:44:12] <_|Nix|_> OK ... 
[13:45:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just hope there are no unexpected consequences of our moving the popup like that.
[13:45:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:55:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Of course, the next observation is that the screen can move to the end of the body right away, because it never contains anything that needs enhancing. That's a hop, skip and a jump away from saying that all popups should share the same screen.
[13:55:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... otherwise the bottom of the body will be littered with screens.
[14:01:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, OK. Looks decent.
[14:01:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if this addresses all our cover-the-toolbar concerns.
[14:43:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's a consequence: Popups have no theme by default because they have nothing from which to inherit. The body doesn't have a theme, AFAIK.
[14:44:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'll have to move the popup and the screen to the bottom of the page, not the body :/
[14:44:58] <_|Nix|_> ... and there's some funkyness with the custom select - tests are failing, but I can't figure out why. I'll have a look in the morning.
[14:45:15] <_|Nix|_> Calling it a day, I think ... L8Rz ...
[15:24:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: you around?
[15:43:08] <gseguin> arschmitz: now I am
[15:43:13] <gseguin> arschmitz: 'sup?
[16:53:27] <arschmitz> gseguin|away: sorry missed you i found the problem with builder and just wanted to ask you about it
[16:58:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: here now
[16:58:53] <gseguin> sorry we keep on missing each other
[16:58:54] <arschmitz> its because we removed depend.js
[16:59:03] <arschmitz> the error is that its not found
[17:00:04] <arschmitz> gseguin: so i think we just need to remove it here by adding another if
[17:00:12] <arschmitz> to check if its 1.4 or later
[17:00:20] <gseguin> ok
[17:00:25] <gseguin> for which param?
[17:00:42] <gseguin> oh so it's not a problem with the backend then
[17:00:44] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/blob/master/builder.js#L210
[17:01:14] <gseguin> do you have commit access to that repo?
[17:01:16] <arschmitz> yes
[17:01:28] <arschmitz> i can do it i just wanted to ask you if that seemed right?
[17:01:37] <gseguin> ok so what would be the array of exclude?
[17:02:03] <arschmitz> same as it is now just without depend
[17:02:10] <arschmitz> because it does not exist any more
[17:02:15] <gseguin> ah!
[17:02:21] <gseguin> that would make sense ;)
[17:02:33] <gseguin> did you try it out?
[17:02:47] <arschmitz> no i havent had a chance yet
[17:02:57] <arschmitz> is there an easy way to test it locally?
[17:05:21] <gseguin> change the host to http://jquerymobile/amd-builder
[17:05:33] <arschmitz> oh yeah lol 
[17:05:37] <gseguin> change the host to http://jquerymobile.com/amd-builder
[17:05:43] <gseguin> that should work
[17:05:57] <arschmitz> yeah ill try it but im pretty sure thats the issue 
[17:06:21] <arschmitz> i knew it had to be something simple and likely in the lib other wise it wouldnt work for 1.3 
[17:14:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup that does it 
[17:16:07] <arschmitz> best part is its a retro active fix so beta will work
[17:18:00] <arschmitz> gseguin: how does this get pushed to live just log into the server and do a pull?

[17:25:10] <gseguin> oh I may know why
[17:25:16] <gseguin> hold on
[17:25:24] <arschmitz> ok
[17:27:06] <gseguin> gnarf: where is the amd builder running again?
[17:27:32] <gseguin> jq02, found it
[17:29:36] <gseguin> arschmitz: try it out
[17:29:43] <gseguin> I may have to bounce the node server
[17:30:35] <arschmitz> still not working for me
[17:30:42] <gseguin> hmm
[17:30:58] <arschmitz> its giving the same error which is weird
[17:31:14] <gseguin> let me bounce it
[17:31:24] <arschmitz> ok
[17:31:45] <arschmitz> gseguin: wait that cant be it
[17:31:54] <arschmitz> because local im using the same back end builder
[17:31:59] <arschmitz> because i point the host to it 
[17:33:54] <gseguin> try that again
[17:34:03] <gseguin> true 
[17:36:24] <arschmitz> ok wooo new error lol
[17:36:35] <gseguin> ah shit
[17:37:06] <arschmitz> just another missing file
[17:37:30] <arschmitz> i should be able to take care of it
[17:38:04] <gseguin> something is still referencing depend
[17:38:24] <arschmitz> yeah and page.sections
[17:38:38] <arschmitz> but i see the depend issue
[17:38:48] <arschmitz> will look for page.sections issue
