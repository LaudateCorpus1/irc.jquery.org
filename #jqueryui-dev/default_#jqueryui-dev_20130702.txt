[05:01:23] <gnarf> agcolom_: ping
[05:05:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[05:14:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: morning
[05:14:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: morning
[05:15:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: wanted your opinion on _|Nix|_ comment on checkbox radio
[05:15:45] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/07d11e810bfcc6330328645b1da2717a13f3901c#commitcomment-3545822
[05:15:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it was about flagging that it has been enhanced, right?
[05:16:04] <arschmitz> yes
[05:16:10] <arschmitz> but enhanced is an option not a flag
[05:16:23] <arschmitz> so i dont think we should be changing it
[05:16:49] <arschmitz> not to mention it it can only run on create so it will never be looked at again anyway
[05:18:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: makes sense, no need to change if you ask me
[05:18:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so the only thing it could be useful for is for a dev to check if enhancment is done but i think a custom enhanced event would make more sense for that
[05:19:38] <uGoMobi> that's useful in general, not really related to option enhance
[05:19:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually an event there could be pretty useful i suppose for widgets with the enhance method
[05:19:52] <arschmitz> true
[05:20:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there is a feature request ticket from frequent for that
[05:20:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have not pushed it yet but i also reviewed button
[05:20:42] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:20:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i had one question about button
[05:20:50] <uGoMobi> big issues there?
[05:21:02] <uGoMobi> sure
[05:21:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nah mostly just moving stuff from refresh to setOptions and breaking out enhancment
[05:21:19] <uGoMobi> okay
[05:21:29] <arschmitz> in the intit selector button is still there
[05:21:37] <arschmitz> i thought button didnt use the button widget any more?
[05:21:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it still does
[05:22:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have been thinking about moving to buttonMarkup
[05:22:34] <uGoMobi> because it is just about adding/removing classes
[05:24:00] <uGoMobi> but I there was something why we shouldn't move it... let me try to remember :)
[05:24:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm ok so unless its something internal to another widget all buttons are going through button widget then?
[05:24:39] <uGoMobi> button widget is only for button element and input type button/submit/reset
[05:24:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the select also has type=button
[05:25:00] <uGoMobi> anchors with data-role button get their classes from buttonMarkup
[05:25:01] <arschmitz> so all links will be enhanced also
[05:25:22] <uGoMobi> huh? select type=button?
[05:25:28] <arschmitz> oh never mind thats like type=button
[05:25:38] <arschmitz> never mind early still hazy
[05:25:41] <arschmitz> lol
[05:25:48] <uGoMobi> yeah, I don't mean button style
[05:26:19] <uGoMobi> selects and checkboxes etc get the ui-btn class in their own widget
[05:26:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah sorry its my fault i saw [type='button'] and some how in my head that was = [data-role='button']
[05:26:39] <uGoMobi> no problem
[05:26:47] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:27:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: unless there is some reason why it cant be id still like to see button moved
[05:27:44] <uGoMobi> yeah, always better if it isn't a widget
[05:27:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes for something like that for sure
[05:28:05] <uGoMobi> let me think if I can recall when I look at the code
[05:28:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i tend to use <button> a lot vs link to avoid the link binding 
[05:31:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think thats button was the last of the form elements execpt for the select / custom select stuff _|Nix|_ was working on 
[05:31:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so ill move on to the rest of the widgets tonight
[05:31:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[05:32:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: which ones do you have in mind? I was thinking navbar and collapsible
[05:34:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i want to do those as well as toolbar, page, and panel
[05:34:17] <arschmitz> those are all kinda half or mostly done
[05:34:35] <arschmitz> because iv recently done a bunch of work on them but they dont have enhanced id or class options
[05:34:46] <arschmitz> so they should be pretty simple
[05:36:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, good idea to finish those first
[05:36:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im punting on slider,and table stuff 
[05:36:33] <arschmitz> oh listview i think is a must if time allows too
[05:37:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda hoping _|Nix|_ might have time for popup but no idea this morning he said hes really busy with web-fw-ui
[05:37:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that
[05:37:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and july 15 is coming fast
[05:38:00] <uGoMobi> he already has been working on popup though
[05:38:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I know!
[05:38:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i know it works outside a page
[05:38:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so when _|Nix|_ is around we should discuss who works on what and in what order
[05:38:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah 
[05:39:23] <uGoMobi> when textinput is in a branch on the repo I can do the CSS change for search input clear button
[05:39:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it is already 
[05:39:34] <uGoMobi> I think panel is something we have to look into together
[05:39:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree
[05:39:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh sorry, missed that
[05:39:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/textinput/js/widgets
[05:40:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you also mentioned a change in slider CSS because of pointer events
[05:40:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh yeah super simple
[05:41:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: touch-action: pan-y pinch-zoom double-tap-zoom;
[05:41:16] <arschmitz> on .ui-slider
[05:43:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: basicly it disables horizontal scrolling when the event starts on a slider
[05:43:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's to make things work on WP8/Win RT?
[05:43:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[05:43:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can we add -ms prefix?
[05:44:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: otherwise after ~40px it decides this is a scroll and stops sending events
[05:44:11] <uGoMobi> ah I see
[05:44:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah it should have the prefix
[05:44:39] <uGoMobi> okay
[05:45:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on the bright side my android killing 100 slider page
[05:45:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's push that change to master so we can test
[05:45:27] <arschmitz> works perfect with my lumia 520
[05:45:36] <arschmitz> super smooth maybe better then my iphone
[05:45:37] <uGoMobi> wow
[05:46:10] <arschmitz> yea iv been really impressed with the lumia 520 i think i would pick one over an andoird 4.2 phone
[05:46:47] <uGoMobi> what I like about android is that it syncs so nicely with all my Google stuff
[05:47:15] <uGoMobi> but I do like the WP8 interface and the Lumia phones
[05:47:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: true not sure if they have windows apps yet like they do ios ones
[05:47:37] <uGoMobi> really impressed how much phone you get for less than $200
[05:48:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure im impressed with its perfromance everything seems really smooth and the browser seems very fast for a phone
[05:48:24] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:49:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill push the change right now
[05:49:34] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:55:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm i cant push to github
[05:55:08] <arschmitz> its getting errors
[05:55:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: GH is having issues today
[05:55:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh thats always fun
[05:55:36] <uGoMobi> I get 404's all time when browsing the issue tracker
[05:55:50] <uGoMobi> but I was able to push commits
[05:56:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you ever get a chance to test that wp8 opacity issue?
[05:56:22] <arschmitz> i tested and i could not reproduce
[06:02:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I gave my Lumia 520 to my father before I went to Portland so he could try WP8 before buying a Lumia, will get it back tomorrow and test that issue
[06:03:07] <uGoMobi> I suppose I will see the same as you :)
[06:03:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool no rush on it was just curious
[06:03:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lets hope you see the same any way :)
[06:03:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:05:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm here. What's up?
[06:06:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Want me to look at popup?
[06:06:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: your comment on checkboxradio
[06:06:26] <arschmitz> about chaning the enhanced option in the enhance method
[06:06:38] <arschmitz> not sure i agree with that its an option not a flag
[06:07:23] <arschmitz> and im not sure i see the need of a flag since its only going to be checked on create and never again
[06:08:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why don't we then make it this._enhanced?
[06:09:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not folowing
[06:09:17] <arschmitz> enhanced is an option to say your markup is already enhanced
[06:09:26] <arschmitz> so dont enhance it on _create
[06:09:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see!
[06:09:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I completely forgot the semantics.
[06:09:52] <_|Nix|_> I guess alreadyEnhanced would be too long.
[06:10:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah lol
[06:10:50] <arschmitz> and i think it makes sense data-enhanced="true" = data already enahcned
[06:11:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The funny thing is I suspect the corresponding operation of retrieving the elements from the already-enhanced markup that we would have assigned during enhancement is just as expensive as creating them.
[06:11:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i highly doubt it a selector will always be faster then dom manip
[06:12:11] <arschmitz> and so far for everything i haved added to the only selector needed is this.element.parent()
[06:12:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess, especially if we limit it to ... this.element or at most this.element.parent().
[06:12:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Cool!
[06:12:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NM my comment then.
[06:12:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok just wanted to make sure we were on the same page
[06:13:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... sorry ... I'm a bit out of it.
[06:14:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its fine 
[06:14:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I failed to find adequate hosting for the API docs, so I was forced to use wget to mirror things from local.api.jquerymobile.com :/
[06:14:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats no fun
[06:14:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i mean :)
[06:15:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i saw your comment your super busy with web-ui-fw
[06:15:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and a lengthy procedure to change the links and post-process the content: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/blob/jqm/RELEASE.md - check step 4 ...
[06:15:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's a d00zy: find -type f | grep -v '\.git' | sed 's@^\./@@' | while read; do DEPTH=$( dirname "$REPLY" | awk -F '/' '{ if ( $0 == "." ) print 0; else print NF ; }' ); RELPATH=`for (( Nix=0; Nix < $DEPTH ; Nix++ )); do echo -n "../"; done`; cat "$REPLY" | sed -r 's@http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/@'"$RELPATH"'@g' > "$REPLY".new && mv "$REPLY".new "$REPLY" ; done
[06:16:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does not look friendly lol
[06:16:06] <_|Nix|_> Nope :)
[06:16:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: At least it's somewhat documented.
[06:17:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 
[06:17:02] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:17:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when is your target release for web-ui-fw?
[06:17:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... today ... ?
[06:17:39] <arschmitz> cool
[06:19:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as far as widget review have you started on anything besides select / custom select?
[06:19:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I sent an email to the other guys on the team with the two links just to give it some time to stew, but I might as well mention them: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/jqm/0.2.0/demos/ and http://web-ui-fw.github.com/jqm/0.2.0/api-docs/
[06:19:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. Sorry! I'll try to get on it ASAP.
[06:19:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its fine i was just checking
[06:19:51] <arschmitz> didnt want to work on something you already started
[06:19:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono.
[06:20:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, this "enhanced" flag is something we have to weave into all the widgets, eh?
[06:20:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[06:20:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: idea is we can basicly eliminate all dom manip on startup
[06:20:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's interesting, because in some ways it means that we have to make our creation process "reversible", in the sense that our widget structure has to be such that we can recognize it when it's already present.
[06:20:59] <arschmitz> by supplying pre enhanced content
[06:21:30] <_|Nix|_> OK. I gotta go shopping now, and then I'll get started ...
[06:21:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in theory it should make pageinit ultra fast
[06:21:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good 
[06:22:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think there is a bug in your Hue/sat/val picker
[06:35:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was thinking that when enhance option is set to false we should only unbind events in the destroy method
[06:35:59] <uGoMobi> don't you think?
[06:36:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i had been debating about that myself already
[06:36:40] <arschmitz> im a little tossed
[06:36:56] <arschmitz> on one hand destroy is suposed to leave dom as it was before
[06:37:03] <arschmitz> meaning we should just unbind events
[06:37:58] <uGoMobi> yes, that's how I see it
[06:38:02] <arschmitz> on the other hand in a way it kinda makes sense to do the dom teardown because otherwise there is no way to do it unless you handle your self
[06:38:31] <arschmitz> but if you handle the enhancment your self i guess its up to you to unenhance yourself too
[06:38:38] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:39:28] <arschmitz> yeah i think ill change that
[06:49:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: github is being so very very not cool today i cant push to any of my repos!!!
[06:49:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah it's very annoying

[08:49:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds like high contrast mode on a surface breaks css like crazy
[08:51:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, improving accessibility is nice but the way they attempt to do it sucks if you ask me
[08:51:22] <arschmitz> yeah lets just break everyones css im sure it will make it more accessible
[08:52:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: almost seems like we need a special high contrast style
[08:52:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: @media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: active), (-ms-high-contrast: none) { ...
[08:53:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: at least you can detect highcontrast mode in css
[08:53:23] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:53:57] <arschmitz> also makes it easy to target ie10 only rules i suppose lol
[09:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: This seems like it's correct, but I'm surprised that we have this inverted after lots of accessibility reviews: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9407
[09:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> Can you confirm that the ticket is valid?
[09:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone else familiar with ARIA as well ^
[09:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's also annoying that the state is tracked simultaneously by 3 properites.
[09:24:35] <gseguin> mornin' all
[09:25:33] <gseguin> arschmitz, uGoMobi: are there tests that are expected to fail on master ?
[09:25:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: no
[09:26:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: thanks, then it must be something with my code ;P
[09:26:17] <arschmitz> there are one or two that are flaky on travis but locally they should all pass
[09:26:49] <arschmitz> gseguin: out of curiosity what test just to make sure its not one of the flaky ones
[09:26:49] <gseguin> the one that failed so far are unit/select and integration/dialog
[09:27:09] <gseguin> now I have navigation failing too
[09:27:27] <gseguin> ok nevermind let me make sure that they pass locally before my patch
[09:30:20] <uGoMobi> gseguin: that dialog test is one of the tests that randomly fail on travis
[09:31:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just so you know you can enable high contrast on windows 7 also
[09:31:19] <arschmitz> but it did not expose a css property
[09:31:20] <gseguin> ok good to know
[09:31:41] <gseguin> didn't we say that we were going to either fix or disable these unstable tests?
[09:31:50] <arschmitz> until ie10
[09:31:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh, good to know... at least I can see what it does
[09:32:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just go to your themes and pick a highcontrast theme
[09:32:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes but your the only person who has ever got one to fail local if its the same failure
[09:33:15] <uGoMobi> I am still in favor of disabling them until they work as expected on travis
[09:34:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: themes? is that an option somewhere in IE?
[09:34:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no like your desktop theme
[09:34:45] <arschmitz> it effects whole computer not just ie
[09:35:00] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:35:05] <uGoMobi> will check on windows
[09:35:06] <arschmitz> if i recall its right click then personalize 
[09:35:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: tried to do it in browserstack on ie8 but they seem to not give access to what you need to do it
[09:35:41] <arschmitz> i mean ie10 windows 8
[09:38:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... what should popup's widget() return? The container? The screen? Popup is a bit similar to some of the form widgets in that it wraps this.element, but in addition to that, it also moves it to the bottom of the page.
[09:38:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm im going to say the container
[09:39:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, theoretically, it could have a class option as well, but I don't think it needs it, because if you set an ID on the popup, you'll have a variation of that ID on the container.
[09:39:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: [✓] the container.
[09:40:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think it should still have a class / id option for consistancy
[09:40:10] <arschmitz> and replace the current prefixed one with it
[09:40:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, what are the semantics of disabling a popup? 
[09:41:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see, so if the id option is set, then an ID will not be generated, but rather it will be assigned from the option.
[09:41:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right
[09:41:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as far as disabling i think if its disabled it should just not open ?
[09:41:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess so ... 
[09:42:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What if you set an already-open popup as disabled?
[09:42:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i guess the alternative would be to grey the whole thing out?
[09:42:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess.
[09:42:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should either close or grey out or do nothing then just no longer open
[09:42:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... tough call ..
[09:43:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'd favour closing it.
[09:43:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: first need to decide if we want to to not open or just grey out
[09:43:23] <arschmitz> i think not open makes more sense
[09:43:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd say not open.
[09:43:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[09:43:40] <arschmitz> and in that case it should close or nothing and then no longer open
[09:43:40] <_|Nix|_> ... and close if disabled while open.
[09:43:48] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[09:43:49] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[09:43:53] <uGoMobi> +1
[09:43:57] <uGoMobi> and I think that the ID option could just replace the generated ID
[09:44:01] <arschmitz> hmmm im a little tossed on the if its open
[09:44:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep. That's how it looks like it's gonna be.
[09:44:31] <arschmitz> im envisioning someone disabling the popup on open so it can only be opened once or something lol
[09:44:37] <uGoMobi> ok, thought we would still generate an ID if the option has not been set
[09:45:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think thats the best thing maintains back compat
[09:45:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: popup.one( "popupafterclose", function() { $( this ).popup( "option", "disabled", true ); }
[09:45:15] <_|Nix|_> )
[09:45:17] <_|Nix|_> ;
[09:45:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not saying there is not another way just thinking aloud
[09:46:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ...
[09:46:29] <gseguin> johnbender: that change in the <a href> click handler to call navigate instead of changePage breaks a lot of tests
[09:46:37] <gseguin> johnbender: expected?
[09:46:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was just thinking that it's somehow awkward to see a popup behave as if nothing had happened when the disabled flag is already looming over it.
[09:46:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[09:47:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Better to set the disabled flag when it disappears.
[09:47:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: oh yeah i was thinking about that im not so sure that will work
[09:47:54] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Popup has a lot of options, and a lot of them quite hefty.
[09:48:15] <gseguin> arschmitz: why ?
[09:48:34] <arschmitz> none of the page events will be fired
[09:49:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see my note about popup theme inheritance?
[09:49:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No.
[09:49:18] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah they do fire
[09:49:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well it doesn't work anymore :(
[09:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You know if we go with this id/class/enhanced trio in a lot of places, we might want to make that into an extension ... depends of course if we end up with a lot of code duplication or not.
[09:49:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I was working on it, the popup and its container were still child of a page when opened
[09:50:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What broke it?
[09:50:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: popup container is now sibling of the page
[09:50:23] <arschmitz> they do ? how ? maybe im missing something here but the page events are fired by changepage function
[09:50:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It is? Since when?
[09:50:35] <arschmitz> so if we replace with navigate where are they getting fired
[09:50:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If a page is found, it should still be a child of the page.
[09:51:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's what I found
[09:51:25] <uGoMobi> s/found/thought/
[09:51:32] <_|Nix|_> Lemme check that.
[09:51:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let me find the JS Bin
[09:52:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it could be that it's only when there is a panel on the page
[09:54:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looking at the view-source popups on demos/widgets/buttons/ and they're all inside the page. They are siblings with all the children of page.
[09:54:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nevermind... http://jsbin.com/otevuh/9/edit ... it's the alert on that test page that causes it
[09:54:12] <uGoMobi> sorry
[09:54:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[09:54:20] <arschmitz> gseguin: nevermind i see it there is a binding to navigate that calls handlehashchange that calls changepage
[09:54:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: wow seems like this adds a lot of call overhead
[09:54:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just removed the alert because it wasn't relevant and it looks fine :)
[09:56:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: im also not sure exactly how this addresses your problem or that there might not be a better way since in the end its still calling changepage
[10:01:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi brought up the idea of the extension for id / class before
[10:01:24] <arschmitz> problem is its best to add these to the wrapper when its created before its appended
[10:01:58] <arschmitz> so i think its best to handle in each widget individually
[10:02:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no reall added code for this either if you do it that way
[10:05:40] <arschmitz> off to lunch be back in ~1 hour
[10:16:09] <gseguin> arschmitz: because changePage calls navigate at the end to align the url with the current page but the location it calls it with is stripped of the querystring
[10:21:28] <_|Nix|_> Woah! http://news.slashdot.org/story/13/07/02/146251/firefox-takes-the-performance-crown-from-chrome

[10:28:06] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14e1c711b 15Jasper de Groot: Updated JS Bin in contributing guidelines to core 1.10.1
[10:45:27] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#429 (master - e1c711b : Jasper de Groot): The build was broken.
[10:45:27] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/c3075d9aeedf...e1c711b92d20
[10:45:27] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/8665447
[11:28:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: so wouldnt it be better to fix the problem in changepage rather then add the call overhead?
[11:48:46] <gseguin> arschmitz: looking into it
[11:49:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: i already know where it happens and how to fix it i thought i sent you a link before if not ill get it right now
[11:49:34] <gseguin> arschmitz: oh, even better
[11:50:04] <arschmitz> i was going to fix for 1.3 but it was decided it was a breaking change
[11:51:14] <arschmitz> gseguin: as you can imagine its required to implement deeplinking to ids
[11:52:25] <gseguin> arschmitz: so you have a fix? is it on master?
[11:53:12] <arschmitz> no i never got around to implementing deep linking yet i have a branch or local copy somewhere though with the fix give me a few minutes
[11:55:49] <arschmitz> gseguin: basicly what you want is to just pass through the link unaltered right?
[11:59:50] <gseguin> correct
[12:23:03] <gseguin> arschmitz: so one thing I don't get is why toPage is absolute 
[12:23:16] <gseguin> shouldn't it be just the hash ?
[12:23:41] <gseguin> because we keep track of the absolute url via absUrl
[12:24:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: its to fully qualify it to things listening
[12:24:27] <arschmitz> you could have the same hash on multiple pages
[12:24:56] <gseguin> but isn't that the purpose of absUrl ?
[12:25:12] <gseguin> the triggerData contains both toPage and absUrl
[12:25:19] <gseguin> and they are the same
[12:25:23] <arschmitz> true
[12:29:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok so the solution is a one liner
[12:29:23] <arschmitz> take that back 2 lines
[12:29:26] <arschmitz> i found it
[12:29:47] <gseguin> yeah got it too I think
[12:30:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: $.mobile.path.parseUrl( triggerData.absUrl ).hash
[12:30:22] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L913
[12:30:31] <arschmitz> replace url with that
[12:31:18] <gseguin> I used toPage.data( "absUrl" ) and assigned the url var with that value
[12:31:23] <arschmitz> gseguin: will also need to do it in the else right below
[12:31:32] <gseguin> it was something we started exploring with johnbender
[12:31:43] <gseguin> only I was using the wrong data
[12:32:07] <gseguin> running the test suites
[12:32:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: expect some failures
[12:32:33] <gseguin> checkboxradio failed
[12:34:45] <jlembeck> https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software - awesome.
[12:37:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: that changes breaks nav
[12:37:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: because it appends a hash to the end of all urls
[12:37:57] <gseguin> arschmitz: does it?
[12:38:11] <arschmitz> hmm wait it was but now its not
[12:38:24] <arschmitz> something i did navigating around made the hash stick
[12:38:29] <arschmitz> see if i can do it again
[12:40:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: hmm not sure i can reproduce again
[12:40:44] <arschmitz> i had it happen like 3 times in a row but now cant do it again lol
[12:41:01] <gseguin> hmmm, I've got a bunch of test failures
[12:41:24] <arschmitz> gseguin: im not suprised
[12:41:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: many are probably just false assumptions
[12:41:50] <arschmitz> that portions of the url would be stripped
[12:42:38] <gseguin> but they seem more reasonable than the ones I had when changing the call in the click handler
[12:43:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah i think this is the proper way to implement your change
[12:43:52] <gseguin> I'll try to fix the tests before checking in
[12:44:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: im running them now also to see whats failing
[12:44:26] <arschmitz> gseguin: its stripping the dialog hash key
[12:44:40] <arschmitz> will need to figure out how to work around that
[12:45:07] <gseguin> arschmitz: http://pastebin.com/L4XpJqMC
[12:45:16] <gseguin> this is my patch
[12:46:03] <arschmitz> gseguin: ah ok a little different then what i thought you were saying let me make that change
[12:46:29] <gseguin> k
[12:49:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok so unit tests are 100% passing
[12:49:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: indeed
[12:53:40] <arschmitz> looks like form submission may be an issue though
[12:53:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: but al the navigation test failures i expected those are just false assumptions that need to be fixed
[12:57:23] <gseguin> yep
[15:30:27] <johnbender> gseguin: ping!
[15:30:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I saw your questions from yesterday
[15:30:34] <gseguin> yo
[15:30:47] <johnbender> I'm sure there are some expectations about when events are to be fired baked into the test
[15:30:50] <johnbender> *tests
[15:30:52] <johnbender> gseguin: how bad are the failures
[15:30:53] <gseguin> johnbender: did you see the new patch I proposed: http://pastebin.com/L4XpJqMC
[15:30:54] <johnbender> and which suites?
[15:31:00] <johnbender> NO! Looking now :)
[15:31:06] * johnbender drank some coffee earlier
[15:31:07] <gseguin> try it out 
[15:31:22] <gseguin> johnbender: 2 suites are failing including navigation
[15:31:26] <johnbender> gseguin: our connection is a bit slow here
[15:31:29] <gseguin> johnbender: nothing surprising
[15:31:34] <johnbender> gseguin: yah but how bad is the failure?
[15:31:41] <johnbender> is it like epic destruction?
[15:31:45] <johnbender> or one/two tests
[15:31:50] <johnbender> frankly the second one is worse o.O
[15:32:15] <gseguin> no 23 failed assertions
[15:32:18] <gseguin> so no biggie
[15:32:26] <johnbender> gseguin: just for nav?
[15:32:43] <johnbender> gseguin: is that pastebin the only change?
[15:33:14] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm curious what happened to the link change
[15:36:57] <gseguin> johnbender: http://pastebin.com/ftCkjJEw
[20:50:56] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15lpfister opened issue #6128: How to disable the active state for all buttons (but not for form element)  02http://git.io/n57fEQ
[22:13:01] <johnbender> gseguin: when is good for you to discuss tomorrow
[22:13:03] <johnbender>  I can try to be online
[22:13:32] <gseguin> can you do 10am MDT ?
[22:13:36] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[22:13:52] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, we might be back from breakfast at 11
[22:13:55] <johnbender> seems unlikely though
[22:14:03] <johnbender> gseguin: I think those failures are fully legit
[22:14:13] <johnbender> gseguin: the data url and query param checks look like a problem
[22:14:29] <johnbender> gseguin: what happened to switching the link bindings, not viable?
[22:15:03] <gseguin> johnbender: nope not viable
[22:15:14] <gseguin> johnbender: it creates a delay
[22:15:24] <johnbender> yah
[22:15:29] <johnbender> that makes sense
[22:15:40] <johnbender> triggering the event means a lot of call stack
[22:15:44] <johnbender> hmm
[22:15:48] <johnbender> that's unfortunate
[22:16:29] <johnbender> gseguin: have arschmitz or _|Nix|__ merged in the content-widget branch changes?
[22:16:34] <johnbender> I suppose I could go look
[22:16:34] <johnbender> lol
[22:16:35] <johnbender> brb
[22:17:12] <johnbender> nope
[22:17:13] <johnbender> not yet
[22:17:26] <johnbender> that might help reasoning about it
[22:17:43] <johnbender> gseguin: but it look like the way the urls are set up is part of the house of cards
