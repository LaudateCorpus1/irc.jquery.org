[10:49:56] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so for http://jqbug.com/ui/p482 is there somewhere i should be able to reference these changes for correctness or are we just trusting them?
[11:13:56] <rworth> kborchers: the best source I know of is Globalize
[11:15:16] <kborchers> ok, from what i've seen online, i think i'm ok with what they changed but I will check Globalize as well. One thing i don't like is how they added periods to all of the abbreviations. thoughts?
[11:15:21] <kborchers> rworth ^
[11:16:03] <rworth> hmm, I'd look for a precedent before accepting that, yeah
[11:17:13] <kborchers> ok, thanks
[11:23:04] <kborchers> rworth: globalize has periods in the day name abbreviations but in the short day name and short month names, there are no periods. i'm thinking these should also not have periods. do i just edit their commit or have them fix it?
[11:23:28] <rworth> you can edit it
[11:23:36] <kborchers> ok, will do. thanks
[11:23:43] <rworth> feel free to link to the globalize culture fill in your commit msg if you like
[11:23:48] <rworth> file even
[11:23:55] <kborchers> ok i will
[12:29:15] <kborchers> ok, so i have all of the localization PR's merged into a branch on my repo. Hoping to hear back from github about my issue but not holding my breath. if i don't hear back soon, i'll just send a PR from my repo so someone else can merge them.

[13:59:59] <kborchers> rworth, jzaefferer: either of you around? question about merging my localization branch and pushing. do i that? merge with master then push or do i need to do it a different way?
[14:00:30] <jzaefferer> just send a regular PR for that
[14:00:39] <kborchers> oh, ok
[14:00:56] <jzaefferer> PRs are still useful even with write access

[14:05:57] <kborchers> jzaefferer: should i merge that or you guys want to look at it first/
[14:07:02] <jzaefferer> look first
[14:07:06] <jzaefferer> that's the point of a PR :-)
[14:07:22] <jzaefferer> ooh, so many people already participating \o/
[14:08:01] <kborchers> everyone wants to be involved in what i do ;)
[14:08:32] <jzaefferer> the whole DOM-ready thing is still really weird
[14:08:35] <jzaefferer> whaever
[14:13:27] <kborchers> so by looks good does that mean go ahead and merge jzaefferer? sorry if i'm being annoying but trying to finish this before i leave in 15 minutes. i can do it later if you would like anyone else to see it first.
[14:13:46] <jzaefferer> yes, let's land it
[14:14:05] <jzaefferer> thanks for jumping throug these hoops.
[14:14:13] <kborchers> no problem
[14:14:15] <jzaefferer> at least now you can blame me if Scott later finds something missing ;)
[14:14:28] <kborchers> ok, just automatically merge via github then close the tickets
[14:14:54] <kborchers> you know if that will close their pr's too or will i need to do that manually as well?
[14:15:42] <jzaefferer> need to close each one manually
[14:15:50] <kborchers> ok, will do
