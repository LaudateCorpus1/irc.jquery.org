[06:15:58] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I think I figured out why the stale animation tests on the toolbar sometimes fail. I was retrieving an element in the outermost IIFE, which means there's a race between that selector running and the DOM arriving. I've moved the retrieval into the module setup, so the element should now always be there when the selector runs.
[06:30:08] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: awesome 
[06:30:20] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: have you had a chance to look at the git tests failing 
[06:30:27] <arschmitz> i thought you had already fixed that
[06:33:36] <gabrielschulhof> In the git tests, there's only one additional failure. Something about popup focus.
[06:34:10] <gabrielschulhof> The kitchen sink stuff I think is due to slider. Somewhere, a class name is being set to undefined
[06:49:08] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Slider backcompat was still using $.mobile.activeBtnClass, resulting in an undefined in the class attribute. I replaced it with ui-button-active.
[06:49:41] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: no i was still seeing all the preventDefault last week unless you fixed it
[06:49:50] <gabrielschulhof> I didn't fix it.
[06:50:00] <gabrielschulhof> O_o
[06:51:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: git is good now, all on its own - must've been fixed in core.
[06:51:33] <gabrielschulhof> ... aside from that one focus test.
[06:51:39] <gabrielschulhof> I'll look at that.
[06:51:40] <arschmitz> cool
[06:51:43] <arschmitz> wfm
[06:57:23] <gabrielschulhof> Yaay ... the focus issue can be reproduced locally. No need to for the travis round trip.
[07:02:19] <arschmitz> Nice
[07:02:25] <arschmitz> im reviewing popup right now

[08:48:06] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: My popup backcompat tests /are/ in a separate file. I've commented to that effect on the PR.
[08:48:29] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'm checking all that wonderful style option/class option value synching.
[08:49:00] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: tests/integration/popup/backcompat-tests.html and tests/integration/popup/backcompat_core.js
[08:49:43] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: The st00pid PR doesn't let you link to the header representing a file in the diff, so I linked to the first line of the file.
[08:50:12] <gabrielschulhof> Like, to line 1 of tests/integration/popup/backcompat-tests.html
[09:02:11] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Tests are back to failing only because of the rangeslider thing.
[09:02:48] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: just commented not sure what happened there
[14:46:41] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Ping! D'you think you could have a quick look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8190/? It's pretty straight forward, fixing all the tests except rangeslider.
[14:48:20] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: done
[14:48:44] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Thanks!
[14:48:52] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: when you get a sec and you also look at a few of my prs

[14:49:48] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: so far so good on device testing too
[14:49:56] <gabrielschulhof> Excellent!
[14:50:08] <gabrielschulhof> Sure. I'll have a look.
[14:50:10] <arschmitz> Trying to put them through their paces 
[14:50:17] <gabrielschulhof> Yeah, that's great!
[14:55:55] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Can you push the branch for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8169/ to the main repo so I can see what it'd look like?
[14:56:06] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Oh, NM. I'll just pull it.
[14:56:21] <arschmitz> git pru 8169 :-)
[14:58:07] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Do I need some sort of extension to git for that?
[14:59:06] <arschmitz> its on contribute somewhere just a sec
[14:59:33] <arschmitz> https://contribute.jquery.org/repo-maintainers-guide/
[15:01:58] <gabrielschulhof> Nice!
[15:05:18] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Why did you also add a button inside a fieldcontain?
[15:05:31] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I understand the checkbox with the legend, but the button?
[15:05:58] <arschmitz> Oh i did it just because there was not one and wanted to make everything was consistent
[15:06:12] <arschmitz> and lined up properlu
[15:06:21] <gabrielschulhof> Aaah, OK.
[15:06:37] <arschmitz> since the checkbox is basicly a button
[15:12:13] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Have you tried running the flipswitch active thing past jasperdegroot?
[15:12:39] <arschmitz> i dont think he has looked yet or i assume he would have commented
[15:13:07] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: I'll assign it to him and mark it as needing discussion then.
[15:14:42] <arschmitz> yay jsperf is back
[15:15:04] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, halleluyah!
[15:15:20] <gabrielschulhof> I can so use that with listview!
[15:15:21] <arschmitz> i kept trying to use it and it was not there :-(
[15:15:33] <gabrielschulhof> I know, eh? Is it authenticated now?
[15:15:51] <gabrielschulhof> There was some discussion about adding GH auth to prevent spam.
[15:16:08] <gabrielschulhof> ... and that that would be slated for jsperf 2.0.0.
[15:16:32] <arschmitz> just captch
[15:16:52] <gabrielschulhof> OK, that's good too.
[15:17:24] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: Can you click on a span + tabindex in iOS?
[15:17:26] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: oh that important was jasperdegroot idea he put it in the issue
[15:17:35] <gabrielschulhof> Oh, OK.
[15:19:40] <jasperdegroot> arschmitz: gabrielschulhof I will look into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/8168 tomorrow
[15:19:53] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: Don't worry about it. You already have.
[15:20:11] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: You commented in the issue that the !important is the best way to go.
[15:20:39] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: When I did the popup arrow, I was gonna use a div for the target, but I found that on iOS I wasn't getting any click events. So, I had to turn the div into an anchor.
[15:20:43] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: yeah, but I can give it a final review / test
[15:20:53] <gabrielschulhof> jasperdegroot: OK. Back to you then :)
[15:20:57] <arschmitz> gabrielschulhof: do you mean line http://output.jsbin.com/guwesa?
[15:21:46] <travis-ci> jquery/jquery-mobile#2722 (1.5-dev - 474c9dd : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[15:22:26] <gabrielschulhof> arschmitz: No, I was actually using a simple div. If that works, then cool.
[15:23:26] <arschmitz> yes that works
[15:23:37] <gabrielschulhof> OK. All good then.
[15:24:02] <arschmitz> un switched all the ancors to spans with tabindex a while back
[15:24:03] <arschmitz> ui
[15:24:32] <jasperdegroot> gabrielschulhof: arschmitz : I just tested that flipswitch text color fix, and we have to add text-shadow: inherit !important; as well
[15:24:35] <gabrielschulhof> Really, wow!
[15:24:39] <jasperdegroot> will comment on the PR
[15:24:57] <arschmitz> thats ugly :-(
[15:26:12] <arschmitz> well lets hope we can do better with chassis / re-write
[15:26:45] <jasperdegroot> get rid of text shadow for starters ;)
[15:27:30] <jasperdegroot> and we won't be using the complex CSS inheritance anymore so that should solves those things
[15:29:52] <gabrielschulhof> *sigh* ... did I mention that I hate the way GH doesn't create a new history entry as you click on the various tabs of the PR :/ I'd love to just Alt + Left Arrow to go back to the comments, but nooooo I need to go hunting for the st00pid tab with my mouse, wasting valuable seconds :/
[15:30:18] <gabrielschulhof> #&ui-state=dialog anyone :)
