[10:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: The IE failure is probably related to default font size or something like that.
[10:54:14] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I think it's rounding of some sorts. It's an odd one because it *looks* fine. It's on my list of things to play with but I haven't gotten around to it.
[10:54:15] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: You have 1 new message (and 1 unread), use `read when you wish to read it.
[10:54:19] <tj_vantoll> `read
[10:54:19] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 5mon 3w ago: Isn't this line backward? https://github.com/tjvantoll/Declarative-Widgets/blob/master/declarative-widgets.js#L35
[10:54:25] <b-ot> tj_vantoll: From scott_gonzalez, 5d 23h ago: the web components list looks good. I've also been wondering what kind of perf hit we take with all the round trips between native and JS. I wouldn't expect it to be worse than pure JS initialization, but we have talked about init-free widgets for better perf.
[10:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> Converting all the six letter options to five letter options makes the test pass.
[10:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> The words are just long enough to cause the menu to actually be bigger.
[10:55:56] <scott_gonzalez> The behavior is correct.
[10:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> And the test is properly failing.
[10:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> We can either force sizes by using a fixed-width font and resetting all the styles.
[10:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can remove the menu width checks. They really don't belong here anyway.
[10:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> The width option tests should really only look at the button size.
[10:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> The menu size logic isn't based on the width option at all.
[10:57:45] <tj_vantoll> It seems like there should be *some* test for menu width somewhere.
[10:58:13] <tj_vantoll> There's a decent amount of code to handle that. It's hard though because we can't really make it precise.
[10:58:40] <tj_vantoll> My thought is to eliminate the tests for now.
[10:59:34] <tj_vantoll> fnagel might have some thoughts because he looked into it too.
[11:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> There's not a decent amount of code to handle it. It's only like 3 lines of code for menu width.
[11:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's the exact same logic that autocomplete has.
[11:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't think autocomplete has any tests for menu width.
[11:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not saying that we can't test it, but testing it based on the width option is wrong.
[11:58:49] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: That makes sense. And I'm fine removing it. I'm just saying I think it is something worth testing, but given how challenging for very little value, I agree with removing.
[11:59:10] <tj_vantoll> Ugh bad sentences. I think I need more coffee.
[12:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[12:56:26] <gabriel_schulhof> I think updatePagePadding() is broken.
[12:57:38] <gabriel_schulhof> It's supposed to set the page padding when there's a fixed toolbar, but it doesn't. I think that's because the position it computes is NaN when it's set to auto.
