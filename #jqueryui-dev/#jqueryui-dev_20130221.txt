[01:47:22] <fnagel> Hey guys, is there a way to nicely sequentially animatze multiple elements?
[01:53:19] <esas> fnagel: iirc you can set a complete callback for animations.. just call and nest... not super pretty, but
[01:55:22] <fnagel> thanks esas! Im aware of the callback functions. Some more elegant solution? I always thought this should be possible by animation queue but it seems this wont work witrh multiple elemenmts.
[02:01:42] <esas> I think you need to code something yourself for that functionality
[02:05:20] <esas> and I have a hard time seeing how it can get more elegant.. afaik you can't pause an object and resume it..
[02:05:41] <esas> see if this can help http://api.jquery.com/clearQueue/ tho i don't think so
[02:09:17] <esas> if there were something like resumeQueue (clearQueue would have to store the cleared items, tho), you could set your object like usual, then clearQueue it.. after that build an own queue where you load the object ids.. that queue is then responsible for calling resumeQueue in the correct order
[02:11:01] <esas> BUT, you would need to extend the queue to include an overridden clear method and a new resume method.. and I haven't used the queue much, so I might lead you into a totally wrong direction
[02:11:02] <esas> cheers

[06:30:17] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #110 by The-Librarian (16m 20s ago): Themeroller: Color of generated icon image differs from given hex value
[06:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> Who knows about colors?
[06:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: So you're seeing the wrong color in both of your browsers?
[06:39:12] <rxaviers> nope, the right one
[06:39:12] <b-ot> rxaviers: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[06:39:17] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[06:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> That screenshot is showing the wrong color for me :-P
[06:39:38] <rxaviers> well, I've opened it on Gimp and checked the number there.
[06:40:19] <rxaviers> Let me convert that image to .JPG and reattach
[06:40:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0z1P2s3j2n0B
[06:40:25] <rxaviers> Maybe a PNG bug in chrome?
[06:40:53] <rxaviers> ah!
[06:40:58] <rxaviers> interesting
[06:41:03] <rxaviers> how do you check the image color?
[06:41:13] <rxaviers> firebug?
[06:41:23] <scott_gonzalez> There's a utility called DigitalColor Meter that comes with OS X.
[06:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> It shows the color for whatever pixel your cursor is hovering over.
[06:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> Can you set the color type?
[06:42:32] <rxaviers>  The-Librarian posted an interesting thing
[06:42:37] <rxaviers> let me check
[06:45:05] <rxaviers> Im leaving for lunch. checking when back
[06:45:19] <rxaviers> But, that's may be the reason... :/
[06:45:29] <rxaviers> that*
[06:50:08] <rxaviers> there's a "png:color-type" option, will test
[06:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Are people done dating yet? We miss you <3
[07:46:04] <tapius> Did something change in the JQUeryUI 1.10.0 that would cause my modal close buttons to look/behave differently?
[07:46:19] <tapius> im looking for assistance to get my close buttons to look like they used to
[07:47:53] <tapius> im comparing the 1.8.24 and the 1.10.0 custom css files and the ui-icon-close positions seems to be the same, but the main difference im noticing is that that the element calling those ui-dialog-titlebar-close classes are different, the new one is a anchor element, and the old one a button element with span
[07:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> They are in fact different.
[07:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> If you're looking for support, that would be in #jquery.
[07:53:02] <tapius> thanks
[07:56:03] <tapius> scott_gonzalez, that room is difficult to get someone, would you be able to point me in the right direction?

[09:20:23] <rxaviers> cool
[09:41:02] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, it seems I solved the problem by using IM 6.6 instead of 6.8
[09:41:10] <rxaviers> stage has been updated and seems to work to me
[09:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[09:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> We had to downgrade IM to get proper results?
[09:43:24] <rxaviers> yeah :'(
[09:44:19] <rxaviers> ideally we would investigate what actually caused it and fix it / open a bug / figure out it's a config thing (although I used the same configure params)
[09:45:09] <rxaviers> (Im not saying it's a config thing.. it could be a, although I dont see anything that points in this direction)
[09:45:49] <rxaviers> I will try to figure out who and talk with IM devs about it
[09:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Always a pain working with broken code when you're not at all familiar with the underlying code.
[09:48:11] <rxaviers> sure
[09:49:00] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, does it sound good? For now open infra issues to change puppets to use 6.6 IM instead.. When we have a newer IM that works correctly, we upgrade it in infra as well.
[09:49:37] <rxaviers> I've created the IM-6.6.deb package that I installed on stage.
[09:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, I won the Paul's regex challenge :-P

[11:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> Some interesting stats: http://cl.ly/image/2R1L2X3B3y0Y
[11:43:35] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, did commits/tickets over time increased/the same?
[11:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> That's a good question.
[11:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/graphs/commit-activity only shows 1 year, so I'd need to do my own analysis.
[11:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> Do you happen to know if there's a tool for generating ASCII graphs?
[11:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> I've been doing my analysis using https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools
[11:46:59] <rxaviers> from your data, (dividing commits/period)
[11:46:59] <rxaviers> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/graphs/commit-activity
[11:47:00] <rxaviers> ops
[11:47:04] <rxaviers> 1.7.0-1.8.0 47,25 commits/month
[11:47:04] <rxaviers> 1.8.0-1.9.0 78,35 commits/month
[11:47:04] <rxaviers> 1.9.0-1.10.0 132,33 commits/month
[11:47:05] <rxaviers> 1.10.0-present 27,5 commits/month
[11:47:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, cool: https://github.com/andrewjstone/cli-chart
[11:47:37] <rxaviers> hmm from the top of my head I dont know any good one ASCII graphs.. maybe gnuplot has a ASCII output
[11:48:23] <rxaviers> this is cool
[11:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...can't label the bars though.
[11:49:37] <rxaviers> it seems so far we have every kinda app on node.js
[11:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna create an issue so that I remember to build this later :-)
[11:49:53] <rxaviers> (or at least started on)
[11:49:58] <rxaviers> :D
[11:51:26] <rxaviers> touch events on w3c
[11:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I could probably use the activeDays method to parse out the info for the graph: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-tools#activedays-committish-callback-
[11:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> At least, that's what I was thinking when I decided to generate all that data :-P

[14:00:35] <kborchers> sounds good to me
[14:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> What do you call those charts that have circles with lines connecting them?
[14:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not flow charts.
[14:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Just things that are related.
[14:18:53] <gnarf> venn diagrams?
[14:19:23] <scott_gonzalez> No, I found what I was thinking of, but still no name.
[14:19:37] <kborchers> flow charts?
[14:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/jquery/demo.html
[14:20:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, so flow charts is the term you were looking for?
[14:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, withou the flow though.
[14:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> More like entity-relationship diagrams.
[14:21:26] <kborchers> ah yes ‚Ä¶ the old ERD
[14:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> Though that demo does have a lot of flow.
[14:21:56] <kborchers> drew a lot of those in database design courses
[14:22:17] <kborchers> and actually a few in real work too
[14:22:20] <kborchers> don't miss those days
[18:55:28] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ping
[18:59:24] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: it's a bit jumpy and a total hack but shows it's doable \o/ http://www.screenr.com/LSc7
[20:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> whoa
[20:24:31] <gnarf> kborchers: thats crazy
[20:24:38] <kborchers> :)
[20:25:52] <kborchers> like i said though, it's definitely a hack
[20:26:07] <kborchers> i have to figure out how to do it right after my talk
[20:27:37] <kborchers> right now i am attaching a "type" to the call to move and then checking that type in draggable and resizable's move methods to ignore calls from the other xbox toggle stick ‚Ä¶ if that makes sense
[20:37:33] <gnarf> yeah, are we going to do a pointer event ID system in the abstraction there?
[20:37:50] <gnarf> to track multiple touch/dual stickage?
[20:49:47] <kborchers> not sure ‚Ä¶ we just started exploring the multiple stuff but i would imagine that's probably a good place to start
