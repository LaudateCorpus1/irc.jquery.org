[04:55:53] <jperrault> I'm working on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9264.  The issue occurs here: http://tinyurl.com/kocramv.  Is there a reason we are "special casing" heightStyle==="auto"?

[06:10:26] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: I'm looking for one more pair of eyes on this before I land it https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1248

[06:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really understand where the 14/20 come from.
[06:13:44] <tj_vantoll> 14/20?
[06:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> line 1137
[06:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling this will accept other bad input.
[06:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, there's just bad indentation. I didn't notice that 1138 was part of 1137
[06:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the right fix might be just another condition in there.
[06:15:16] <tj_vantoll> Yeah it's sniffing for timestamps and "ticks".
[06:15:54] <tj_vantoll> Ah true.
[06:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> Though I guess it depends if we're actually supposed to match on 1 digit.
[06:16:04] <scott_gonzalez> He didn't add a test case for that.
[06:16:51] <tj_vantoll> A one-digit year?
[06:22:44] <scott_gonzalez> He set the min size to 1.
[06:22:56] <scott_gonzalez> So presumably that's accepting one digit years, not just 2.
[06:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> But that would be the case even for yy.
[06:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> 12/31/0001 does seem a bit strange to write though.
[06:23:42] <tj_vantoll> I'm testing it now and it works as expected with 1 digit years.
[06:23:55] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/28nx6/
[06:24:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[06:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see.
[06:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's the opposite of what I thought it was.
[06:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> It accepts 1 for everything but y and yy.
[06:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> I see why he did that.
[06:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> Let's compare this to Globalize first.
[06:27:41] <tj_vantoll> To see how it handles "y" and "yy"?
[06:30:15] <tj_vantoll> Here's what Globalize uses in 1.0 http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table
[06:31:13] <tj_vantoll> Quite a bit different than current datepicker, but far more sensical.
[06:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, the parsing it totally different.
[06:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, go ahead and land this.
[06:33:15] <tj_vantoll> Thanks for the sanity check. It'll be so much nicer when Globalize does this.
[06:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for reviewing that. I see datepicker and run away :-/

[08:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll1: I've got the calendar branch down to 94 commits (from 103 or 104), but I don't want to do anything else until the first commit in the branch doesn't cause tons of test failures.
[08:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking about just starting a new PR from here, so we can start another round of review, and try to clean things up from there.
[08:17:05] <tj_vantoll1> I think that's sane.
[08:18:57] <tj_vantoll1> It'll be an epic PR but there's no good way around that at this point.
[08:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> So, I think now's the time for me to force push the datepicker branch.
[08:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> So that this PR actually makes sense.

[11:23:05] <Beginner> Hi, do you know information, that bugzilla (Trac) is out of work? When i tried to create a new ticket, I obtain this error: AttributeError: Cannot find an implementation of the "IRejectHandler" interface named "CaptchaSystem". Please update the option spam-filter.reject_handler in trac.ini. 
[11:29:19] <Beginner> Who is responsible for Trac (bugzilla) ??
[12:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> Beginner: That was on bugs.jqueryui.com?
[12:17:48] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: no, there is problem: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/newticket
[12:18:32] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: sry, later time in my country- you have right url ;-)
[12:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why you'd be getting that error. Can you try again and see if it still happens?
[12:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, Trac has nothing to do with Bugzilla. They're completely different pieces of software.

[12:36:06] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: yes, i tried 3 days to add my bug 3 times. Firefox and Chrome. There is screen: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rkiwx7eu6kw0lt1/bug.png
[12:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's going on since other users are creating tickets without a problem.
[12:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> I've notified the infrastructure team.
[12:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> What's the bug?
[12:39:35] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: thank you, text of my bug: Is it bug? When I click in table's column of links, showed dialog is not centered. When I scroll down monitor, dialog adding bad cooridantes and isn't centered.  Example (tab 2): http://users16.jabry.com/testingpurpose/ko.asp  Solved by removing href="#" (in columns of links).
[12:40:04] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: ui.dialog component , jqueryui-1.,11.0
[12:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> Works for me in Chrome.
[12:40:29] <scott_gonzalez> Is this browser-specific?
[12:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> href="#" tells the browser to scroll to the top of the page.
[12:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> So if that's what's causing your bug, it's a bug in your code.
[12:42:35] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: It is problem also in Chrome. Just scroll little down with mouse wheel in page (tab2). Problem was href="#" in <a tag. So I think it is bad counting coordinates- si it is bug. But My text of bug startin question- is it bug? I am not sure, just asking
[12:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing any bug in Chrome.
[12:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> If I scroll down and click the icon, the dialog opens and it's centered in the window.
[12:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> The page does look pretty broken visually though, before the dialog is even opened.
[12:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, I'm not seeing anything wrong with the dialog. Sounds like you want support, which is in #jquery.
[12:45:23] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: my Chrome: Verze 34.0.1847.116 m, screen of my problem: https://www.dropbox.com/s/qqp2m5c08pgtsc1/bug2.png
[12:45:52] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: I think, it is ui-dialog issue, but only guess...
[12:46:36] <scott_gonzalez> Is your resolution >2000px wide?
[12:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> Or are you zoomed out?
[12:47:27] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: 1920x1080. screen what i sending you was crop by screenshot app
[12:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> That dialog doesn't even look like the dialog on that page.
[12:48:33] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: please go: tab2, then click on any name in first column (Alex for example), but with scrolled monitor
[12:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> The dialog that opens doesn't look anything like the one in your screenshot.
[12:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> It's got a big textarea.
[12:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, you're clearlyl not scrolled in the screenshot. The bug is in your code (using href="#")
[12:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> The page you linked to doesn't even have anchors.
[12:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> Please use #jquery for support.
[12:50:38] <Beginner> scott_gonzalez: ok, if you are saying thats not UI bug, I will continue in IRC chat there. Thx for your time. GN
[13:05:22] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I can't recreate the jquery-color issue, and I don't understand why the OP is using shims.
[13:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not really sure how to get into the situation he's describing.
[13:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> Because at the time the closure is parsed, `jQuery` has to exist.
[13:09:37] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I'm confused here.
[13:10:05] <tj_vantoll> I'll follow up.
