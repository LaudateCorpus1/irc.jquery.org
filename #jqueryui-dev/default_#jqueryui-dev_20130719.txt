[01:48:43] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: Could you please take a peek at https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard/issues/179 if you get a chance? Thanks!
[01:48:49] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Issue #179 by enrique-ramirez (2w 4d ago): ZeroClipboard, jQuery UI dialog and IE.
[02:01:19] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: I don't have an away nick, just an away status (I think)
[02:06:23] <JamesMGreene> oic, I forgot
[02:06:51] <JamesMGreene> I need to go to bed (for a whole 2 hours, whoops) but I think that ZeroClipboard is probably just screwed on that issue... I added a new comment
[02:07:02] <JamesMGreene> later
[02:19:44] <JamesMGreeneZzz> jzaefferer: Curious, why do you need both the `focusin` and `mousedown` handlers in `_createOverlay`?
[02:20:47] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreeneZzz: didn't you want to go to bed?
[02:20:49] <JamesMGreeneZzz> Seems like the `focusin` would handle it...?
[02:21:00] <JamesMGreeneZzz> No, I _should've_ gone to bed
[02:21:15] <JamesMGreeneZzz> At this point I'm too tired to make good chocies ;)
[02:22:45] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreeneZzz: focus the address bar or some other part of the browser UI, then tab to the document. No mousedown event, just focusin that we have to handle
[02:22:56] <JamesMGreeneZzz> Right
[02:23:09] <JamesMGreeneZzz> But why do you need to handle mousedown at all?
[02:23:21] <jzaefferer> And mousedown can prevented in most browsers, except IE of course, which just keeps the focus where it is right now, instead of us having to guess where to put it
[02:23:28] <jzaefferer> *can be
[02:25:50] <JamesMGreeneZzz> I'm still not following what that mousedown handler achieves that the focusin handler doesn't already...?
[02:27:41] <JamesMGreeneZzz> I'd assume calling `preventDefault` on the `focusin` would cancel the following mouse events, wouldn't it?
[02:27:50] <JamesMGreeneZzz> If not, then I suppose you would need both

[03:35:25] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreeneZzz: I'm not sure what happens when you preventDefault a focusin event, but it's very unlikely to prevent the blur on the active element, which the mousedown handler achieves
[04:34:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping
[04:53:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pong!
[04:53:17] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[04:53:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's shakin'?
[04:53:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IE8 bug?
[04:53:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just wanted to check if I can do git pull --rebase origin master in a branch, instead of git merge master
[04:54:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If that branch exists exclusively on your machine, then yes.
[04:54:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise, no.
[04:54:44] <uGoMobi> I thought so
[04:54:53] <uGoMobi> made that mistake with grunticon branch
[04:55:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If in doubt, you can always git reset --hard HEAD
[04:55:14] <uGoMobi> ok then I just merge master in flipswitch
[04:55:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That will discard whatever ill-fated attempt.
[04:55:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:55:32] <uGoMobi> thanks
[04:55:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and you can check the status of individual files with git status
[04:56:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you see any "both modified" or "deleted by us" or "deleted by them" messages, you still have work to do.
[04:56:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise, you're good to go.
[04:56:33] <uGoMobi> any way to avoid merge commits when a branch is pushed already?
[04:56:40] <_|Nix|_> No.
[04:56:44] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[04:56:49] <_|Nix|_> Well, you can cherry-pick, but that's bad.
[04:57:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, you don't need to merge master.
[04:57:06] <uGoMobi> yeah, don't want that
[04:57:30] <_|Nix|_> If master has some undesirable changes, but master~3 is still OK, you can always merge master~3
[04:57:39] <_|Nix|_> That is, three commits behind the HEAD of master.
[04:57:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[04:58:01] <_|Nix|_> ... and of course you can git merge 13ee5d6
[04:58:16] <uGoMobi> yeah many options
[04:58:32] <uGoMobi> but was curious if I could rebase instead of merge
[04:58:47] <uGoMobi> but that's not going to work
[04:59:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: rebase is an operation that destroys commit history. So, if that commit history is recorded in > 1 places then you will create a history discrepancy that needs to be resolved.
[04:59:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you control all the places where the history is recorded, then you can do it.
[04:59:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Otherwise, it's best not to.
[05:00:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah makes sense, thanks for the explanation
[05:01:27] <uGoMobi> lunch... brb
[05:01:32] <_|Nix|_> K.
[05:19:34] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:21:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:21:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Welcome to the frey!
[05:22:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking at the collapsible-widget-review branch I realized that I'd left the collapsibleSet in pretty bad shape. I've now largely rectified that.
[05:22:33] <arschmitz> cool
[05:23:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and I'm going over the widgets looking for implications of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6163 ... I already moved some _setOptions() methods out of the way, adding a parameter that indicates that only internal variables are to be updated.
[05:23:22] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6163 by gabrielschulhof (4d 19h ago): When enhancing an already-enhanced widget, _setOptions() must still be called, but it must do nothing
[05:27:49] <JamesMGreeneZzz> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: I think this is the jQuery core that most closely describes the issue I'm seeing
[05:30:57] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: Perhaps the oddity being that the bug says it is NOT a problem in IE>8... but it is for ZC  :-\
[05:35:30] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: Wait... actually, it seems like the bug would be BENEFICIAL behavior rather than detrimental behavior for that ZC bug  o_O
[05:35:35] <JamesMGreene> wtf
[05:37:40] <_|Nix|_> Grrr! Can't push to github ... 
[05:40:05] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: I have no idea what you're talking about in that issue.
[05:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> Is the problem just that there's a focusin event on an element that's not part the dialog?
[05:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> Because if that's the problem, it's really easy to fix.
[05:59:03] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: yes, I believe that's the gist of it
[05:59:18] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: _Could_ be more complicated only because there is an ActiveX component involved
[05:59:26] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: What's the fix?
[05:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> Proxy https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L712
[06:00:04] <scott_gonzalez> Basically, just add code similar to line 719

[06:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> It may just be something you have to document for users though.
[06:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> But at least you should be able to provide some drop-in code.
[06:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> That function was added specifically to allow users to override it.
[06:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Alternatively, you can change ZeroClipboard to use the .ui-front system.

[07:29:49] <_|Nix|_> s/fitlerable/filterable/ ... spelling.ko must've segfaulted.
[07:29:53] <arschmitz> yeah dont see why not?
[07:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Can do!
[07:32:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In order not to depend on textinput, I'll add a plain old native textinput, and if ( $.mobile.textinput ) { plainOldNativeTextInput.textinput(); } OK?
[07:32:30] <arschmitz> yup
[07:33:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... what if people wanna style the resulting textinput? I need to chain to its wrapperClass option with an option of my own ...
[07:34:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another alternative is to have an option the value of which is a selector identifying the input that serves as the source of text for the filtering.
[07:34:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I actually like this better because we do not generate the markup.
[07:34:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, .filterable( { sourceInput: "#myFilterInput" } );
[07:35:37] <arschmitz> yeah that seems reasonable
[07:35:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess I wanna get these things straight before I head off implementing.
[07:36:12] <arschmitz> i think specifiy i like because you might want it somewhere else on page

[07:37:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! I'll go with that approach.
[07:38:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Woah ... wait a sec ... the filter extension we had did generate its own textinput, eh?
[07:38:43] <arschmitz> yes
[07:38:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, breaking it up like this may mean having to re-introduce the listview filter extension, since that's already public.
[07:39:06] <arschmitz> for backcompt leave it as is if that option is not set
[07:39:25] <arschmitz> we deprecate and remove in 1.5 and force you to specifiy
[07:39:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, I see ...
[07:39:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... but then we need to AMD-depend on textinput.
[07:40:01] <arschmitz> no
[07:40:10] <arschmitz> you check if its there
[07:40:13] <arschmitz> and if it is enhance

[07:48:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... frequent added a bunch of options to the filterable that are really textinput-related, like corners, inset, mini, etc. The original listview extension did not have these options. Thus, I think I'll remove them. After all, if people specify the input via a selector, they can unleash all the options upon the input itself, and if they have been using the extension, they didn't have all those options anyway.

[08:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> only try to realize the truth: it's web dev, you're fucked!
[08:56:07] <arschmitz> :)
[08:56:27] <arschmitz> yeah if you support > 1 browser your generally in trouble lol
[09:31:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: FYI - that trick with no left/right for fixed toolbars didn't fix the external panel issue
[09:32:08] <arschmitz> yeah i was not too hopefull it would but i read it so figured worth a try

[11:39:56] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[11:45:48] <toddmparker> how goes?
[11:45:56] <toddmparker> i just sent you info on the MSFT CDN
[11:46:06] <toddmparker> keep nudging me for info like that
[11:48:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thanks!
[11:48:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: all good here, how are you/
[11:48:32] <uGoMobi> 1.4 alpha keeps us busy :)
[11:51:40] <toddmparker> i bet
[11:51:51] <toddmparker> so what is left on the todo list of ralpha
[11:51:59] <toddmparker> did you get the icons squared?
[11:53:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah icons are done
[11:53:32] <uGoMobi> we can do some tweaking after alpha
[11:53:43] <uGoMobi> that disc is still a bit large
[11:54:29] <uGoMobi> we also have to update the build script so it produces all four CSS files
[11:55:36] <uGoMobi> this also has to wait until after alpha, we haven't documented the loader in head approach yet either
[11:56:07] <uGoMobi> so 1.4 alpha will just have the default, SVG and fallback to external PNG
[11:56:31] <uGoMobi> other than that we are still working on making external panels work and doing some reviewing
[11:59:39] <toddmparker> cool
[11:59:51] <toddmparker> we just updated the loader today to exclude opera from svg.
[12:00:07] <toddmparker> opera has some serious svg issues, even on desktop 12
[12:00:17] <toddmparker> luckily we can downgrade to svg
[12:00:23] <toddmparker> works like a charm
[12:02:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: oh great, will check the grunticon repo
[12:02:58] <uGoMobi> not an issue anymore on Opera Next?
[12:05:03] <toddmparker> in opera 15 (desktop) they switch to blink
[12:05:19] <toddmparker> that seems ok so we're just downgrading presto based opera
[12:05:32] <uGoMobi> right
[12:05:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: didn't jlembeck develop something to create a changelog?
[12:06:08] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: yeah

[12:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: Here's the UI release script: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js#L368
[12:11:00] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: thanks!
[12:11:36] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: should be good now
[12:11:49] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: yeah, I have access
[12:11:58] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:12:01] <jlembeck> and I totally should've rewritten that thing in js :)

[13:09:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[13:09:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: need a sanity check
[13:09:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: By all means.
[13:10:11] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i checked, you cray
[13:10:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not that I think you're insane, or anything :)
[13:10:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unlike some peeps in the room :)
[13:10:53] * _|Nix|_ waves at toddmparker 
[13:11:05] <arschmitz> where in this are we stripping html like strings from input values 
[13:11:10] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/button.js
[13:11:18] <arschmitz> im just not seeing where this is happening 
[13:11:31] <toddmparker> hey _|Nix|_ 
[13:12:10] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker: 
[13:12:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: you thinking about going to austin?
[13:12:57] <toddmparker> thinking about it. jlembeck submitted at talk too
[13:13:21] <toddmparker> not sure tho, going to see how things shake out.
[13:13:32] <toddmparker> love to go tho. austin is great
[13:14:26] <arschmitz> im speaking
[13:15:57] <toddmparker> cool. what's the topic
[13:16:37] <arschmitz> optimizing performance in JQM
[13:18:11] <tj_vantoll> :q!
[13:18:25] <tj_vantoll> Whoops :)
[13:20:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome that you're going!
[13:21:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Checking on that URL.
[13:21:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was actually going either way for the meeting
[13:21:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... *sigh* ... wish I could go ...
[13:22:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill hold down the fort for ya :)
[13:22:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: :)
[13:23:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The only thing we ever do in button.js is /read/ the value. We never set the value, so we can't be modifying the value.
[13:24:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but there is a test for it
[13:24:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, if val() returns the value in some modified fashion, then that's core's business.
[13:24:24] <arschmitz> that if we find html in the value of a button dont use it for the text
[13:24:29] <arschmitz> and it WAS passing
[13:24:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What?! How can the value of a button contain html?
[13:25:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is that not filtered out in lower levels?
[13:25:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you even test whether something is HTML?
[13:25:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/button/button_core.js#L50
[13:27:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was just looking at that.
[13:27:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you copy #val-contains-html into a page on its own and trace how it gets enhanced?
[13:28:02] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/edeluh/34/edit
[13:28:19] <arschmitz> its doing its think on master but i just dont see HOW this is possibly working
[13:28:24] <arschmitz> im missing something
[13:28:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, length > 1 means there /is/ text in the button, but if HTML is supposed to be discarded, then a good test would be that no text ends up inside the button because the whole value is HTML.
[13:29:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[13:29:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so, if the implementation gets broken, /some/ text will end up inside the button even though it shouldn't, breaking the test.
[13:29:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But, like this, the test is useless.
[13:29:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but the bigger question is How this works on master
[13:31:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *shrug* ... I'll trace it ... though I'm bound to be in for a treat if you haven't found the point in the code where this is happening :)
[13:34:19] <arschmitz> wait hold the show
[13:34:24] <arschmitz> my jsbin is flawed
[13:34:34] <arschmitz> and this does not work on master its just a bad test
[13:35:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... You set id to the tag, not value.
[13:35:22] <arschmitz> yup :(
[13:35:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it should be length === 0, not length > 0
[13:35:58] <arschmitz> i just fixed it and on master this is not working as the test suggests it should
[13:36:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it'll happily set the value as the text as long as the value is truthy.
[13:36:33] <arschmitz> ok next question
[13:36:41] <arschmitz> why are we striping html like text?
[13:37:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummm ... security comes to mind ... but I have no idea.
[13:37:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[13:37:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... security ... the value can be set by a potentially malicious user, injecting a hidden input that will affect the values transmitted upon submit.
[13:38:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But again ... I have only the vaguest notion.
[13:38:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you git blame that test?
[13:38:48] <arschmitz> right but whats that have to do with the text of our button
[13:39:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess if you set .text() it will escape out all HTML anyway, so you can't really inject anything.
[13:39:25] <arschmitz> right
[13:39:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: .html() will honour HTML and parse and all that, but .text() will render everything as text, even < and > and & and the likes.
[13:39:56] <arschmitz> yup
[13:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What's up?
[13:40:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, there's really no reason to try and strip ...
[13:40:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: with out button widget we use an inputs value as the text for the button
[13:40:57] <arschmitz> we have a test saying that if this contains anything that looks like html we should not use it
[13:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[13:41:10] <arschmitz> can you think of why we should do this?
[13:41:15] <arschmitz> thats my question lol
[13:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> proxy.text( original.val() )
[13:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> Just don't use .html(), which you shouldn't be doing in the first place.
[13:41:39] <arschmitz> i cant see a good reason for it and wanted to make sure there was some implication i didnt know about
[13:41:48] <arschmitz> we dont use .html we use text() already
[13:42:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so no reason to inspect it.
[13:42:02] <arschmitz> and this behivor didnt actualy work either
[13:42:12] <arschmitz> and it never actually was inspected
[13:42:27] <arschmitz> the test was broken from get go and never truely checked
[13:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:43:03] <arschmitz> so just wanted to make sure there there was not some reason for this before i scrap test and disregard it 
[13:44:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: anyway thanks for confirming this makes no sense :)
[13:44:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I did a git blame and the raison d'être for the test has disappeared.
[13:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> no problem :-)
[13:44:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We used to .html( this.element.val() )
[13:44:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wilto changed that in 7a5e652b956b4bdc8c322762187abb01ba832ce7
[13:47:53] <arschmitz> hmmm
[13:48:05] <arschmitz> either way test deleted

[13:50:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: how are things?
[13:52:35] <arschmitz> gseguin: good
[13:52:48] <gseguin> arschmitz: released?
[13:53:01] <arschmitz> no the changelog and stuff are not quite ready yet
[13:53:09] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin 
[13:53:09] <gseguin> k
[13:53:12] <gseguin> hey uGoMobi
[13:53:23] <uGoMobi> I am creating changelog now
[13:53:29] <gseguin> alright
[13:53:40] <gseguin> let me know if there is anything I can do
[13:53:49] <uGoMobi> I updated demo center from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2
[13:53:59] <uGoMobi> so I think we can tag and release
[13:54:14] <uGoMobi> in mean time I will finish changelog and post it
[13:54:26] <arschmitz> ok
[13:54:27] <uGoMobi> when everything is on the CDN
[13:55:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: gseguin: ok ill get started now
[13:55:50] <gseguin> arschmitz: ok
[13:55:53] <uGoMobi> let's check if we don't forget anything https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[13:56:08] <uGoMobi> although that wiki page needs an update
[13:56:29] <gseguin> I believe the release steps are up to date
[13:58:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill start at the top lol
[13:59:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's always a good idea :)
[13:59:59] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: I get an error when I run $ ruby changelog.rb -h
[14:00:23] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: lemme test it, haven't seen run it for a bit
[14:00:29] <uGoMobi> cannot load such file -- changelog/commit (LoadError)
[14:01:01] <uGoMobi> I see require 'rubygems' in commit.rb
[14:02:03] <jlembeck> ah yes, so, changelog needs to be run from within its own folder, you can specify the jquery-mobile folder as a git directory
[14:02:17] <uGoMobi> aha
[14:02:41] <jlembeck> oh, it's breaking for me, lemme test something quickly
[14:02:48] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[14:03:20] <jlembeck> found the error, lemme push it
[14:03:31] <uGoMobi> ok great
[14:03:45] <jlembeck> done
[14:04:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: we dont use version.txt anymore right?
[14:04:28] <gseguin> nope we don't
[14:04:41] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: awesome, it works now
[14:04:58] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok here goes...
[14:05:12] <gseguin> drum roll!
[14:05:16] <arschmitz> gseguin: 1-10 how likely am i to break something lol
[14:05:31] <gseguin> What could go wrong?™
[14:06:12] <gseguin> also when it's done, it should generate a zip for google cdn
[14:06:29] <gseguin> that is to add to the instructions
[14:07:03] <gseguin> arschmitz: so, so?

[14:12:30] <arschmitz> but i know i have keys i just ssh to it
[14:13:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: any idea?
[14:19:09] <gseguin> hmm
[14:19:20] <gseguin> how did you ssh ?
[14:20:13] <arschmitz> ssh myname@code.origin.jquery.com

[14:20:42] <gseguin> lemme check
[14:21:08] <gseguin> you need the keys for jqadmin
[14:22:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: you need to have your key added to ~/jqadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys
[14:23:33] <gseguin> sorry that is /home/jqadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys
[14:23:48] <arschmitz> ok
[14:24:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: STOP EVERYHTING
[14:24:18] <arschmitz> ok
[14:24:34] <gseguin> arschmitz: before you do anything else you need to reset your git workspace
[14:24:59] <gseguin> because the version changes have been commited
[14:25:23] <gseguin> so you need to reset to the origin/1.3-branch head first
[14:25:29] <gseguin> and then do the process again
[14:25:33] <arschmitz> ok
[14:27:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: do you know if i can add my key to that through the infrstructure repo like i can for others or if i need to get someone to do that manual?
[14:29:57] <gseguin> you can add it
[14:30:06] <gseguin> arschmitz: just sudo vi
[14:30:42] <arschmitz> yeah sorry i more just wanted to make sure i should not do it through the infrastructure repo
[14:30:59] <gseguin> arschmitz: I remember adding it myself
[14:31:06] <arschmitz> but i dont see in there for that so must be manual
[14:31:09] <arschmitz> ok
[14:34:07] <gseguin> arschmitz: don't forget to reset your local git repo
[14:36:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: i did thank you
[14:37:25] <gseguin> arschmitz: sorry to be insisting, we need to add a note in the release instructions
[14:37:40] <arschmitz> no its fine dont want to mess anything up
[14:37:46] <arschmitz> and yeah good to have it there
[14:39:36] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: there still seems to be a problem

[14:39:58] <arschmitz> gseguin: actually was just double checking and missed a version change first time anyway
[14:39:59] <jlembeck> looking.
[14:40:05] <arschmitz> and there it is
[14:40:15] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: thanks!
[14:40:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok fingers crossed for attempt #2
[14:41:50] <arschmitz> gseguin: DOH!!!
[14:41:56] <gseguin> what ?
[14:41:58] <gseguin> what ?
[14:42:06] <arschmitz> failed because file already exists
[14:42:08] <uGoMobi> is DOH a good thing?
[14:42:21] <gseguin> where? on the CDN ?
[14:42:22] <arschmitz> do i need to go clean files out from first time first?
[14:42:38] <gseguin> you may have to
[14:42:43] <arschmitz> gseguin: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/95541f7505fbe963fc61
[14:42:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no its not lol
[14:43:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I already concluded that ;)
[14:43:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:43:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: so do i just need to go nuke that folder first?
[14:43:40] <gseguin> yeah so got that directory and rm -rf /var/www/html/code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.2
[14:43:41] <arschmitz> then reset and try again?
[14:43:48] <gseguin> indeed
[14:43:52] <arschmitz> ok thanks
[14:43:52] <gseguin> hold on though
[14:43:56] <arschmitz> holding
[14:44:08] <gseguin> if you didn't have access how did this get created?
[14:44:31] <arschmitz> lol thats a good question
[14:45:07] <arschmitz> i had actually meant to ask that i thought it was weird because the first time it copied a bunch before failing my key
[14:45:41] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: fixed. Lemme know if you need anything else :)
[14:45:48] <gseguin> so when you ssh jqadmin@code.origin.jquery.com
[14:45:53] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: awesome, thanks again!
[14:45:55] <gseguin> does it log you in ?
[14:46:19] <gseguin> arschmitz: looked a the directory
[14:46:26] <gseguin> wipe it
[14:47:07] <arschmitz> ok and yes i can ssh like that
[14:47:12] <arschmitz> no at least did not try before
[14:47:25] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: it worked! nice!
[14:47:45] <jlembeck> woo
[14:48:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok third times a charm :)
[14:48:45] <gseguin> you reset your git, right?
[14:49:04] <gseguin> arschmitz: ^
[14:49:11] <arschmitz> yes :)
[14:49:23] <arschmitz> back to current commit on origin
[14:49:49] <arschmitz> and ....
[14:51:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok grunt deploy worked!
[14:51:23] <gseguin> wooohoo! 
[14:51:29] <gseguin> hold on again
[14:51:32] <arschmitz> ok now to release ...
[14:51:33] <arschmitz> ok
[14:53:00] <gseguin> arschmitz: now you should have a zip file in dist
[14:53:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup
[14:53:34] <gseguin> a -cdn.zip
[14:53:45] <gseguin> arschmitz: correct?
[14:54:07] <arschmitz> no 
[14:54:10] <arschmitz> just jquery.mobile-1.3.2.zip
[14:54:14] <gseguin> ah shite
[14:54:28] <gseguin> did I not back port that to 1.3-stable ?
[14:54:42] <gseguin> I'm such a f&$* moron sometimes
[14:54:59] <gseguin> ok nevermind
[14:55:03] <arschmitz> ok
[14:55:06] <gseguin> what you can do
[14:55:12] <gseguin> is generate the zip manually
[14:55:18] <gseguin> to send to google
[14:55:29] <arschmitz> ok
[14:56:03] <arschmitz> how is it different then normal zip?
[14:56:04] <gseguin> look at the cdn tasks in the Grunfile.js on master you may want to port then locally and use them to generate the zip
[14:56:27] <gseguin> it shouldn't contain the version
[14:56:34] <gseguin> and there is a manifest in it
[14:56:48] <arschmitz> ok so should i do that before i continue or worry about that after?
[14:56:52] <gseguin> also once you verified what's on the CDN 
[14:57:06] <gseguin> don't forget to push to origin
[14:57:20] <gseguin> I think you can worry about it later
[14:57:32] <arschmitz> ok so ill do the actual release now
[14:57:48] <gseguin> just it would be great if you generated the zip with the files that are currently on your workspace so they're all the same everywhere
[14:58:14] <gseguin> yup
[14:59:17] <arschmitz> gseguin: hmm should the change to package.json be commited it didnt say in the instructions to commit it so i did not
[14:59:24] <arschmitz> but not it complains about changes in workspace

[15:08:12] <gseguin> hmm
[15:08:26] <gseguin> when you reset did you reset hard ?
[15:08:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes
[15:08:44] <gseguin> it should be set to 1.3.3pre
[15:09:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: so do i need to reset again after deploy?
[15:09:14] <arschmitz> maybe i did something wrong
[15:09:22] <arschmitz> after i reset --hard before
[15:09:31] <arschmitz> i then changed to 1.3.2 (removing pre)
[15:09:36] <arschmitz> then grunt deploy
[15:09:37] <gseguin> wait you did adeploy or a release ?
[15:09:45] <gseguin> oh that's why
[15:09:45] <arschmitz> and deploy went fine
[15:09:59] <gseguin> deploy is just to do a test deploy
[15:09:59] <arschmitz> then tried to do release
[15:10:03] <arschmitz> right 
[15:10:08] <arschmitz> i wanted to test first
[15:10:19] <arschmitz> make sure nothing exploded
[15:10:23] <arschmitz> which it did lol
[15:10:25] <gseguin> release will do all the commits and versionning for you
[15:10:29] <gseguin> ok
[15:10:35] <gseguin> so now reset --hard
[15:10:41] <arschmitz> ok
[15:10:49] <arschmitz> done
[15:11:01] <arschmitz> no just do the release? 
[15:11:03] <arschmitz> now
[15:11:08] <gseguin> hold on
[15:11:14] <arschmitz> ok
[15:11:55] <gseguin> let's port the cdn zip generation to 1.3-stable then
[15:11:59] <gseguin> before we release
[15:12:02] <arschmitz> ok
[15:12:08] <gseguin> let me find that commit
[15:12:29] <arschmitz> sure
[15:13:28] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'll do it and double check it locally
[15:13:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: about how long do you think that will take? i just need to give my wife an idea how much longer i will be?

[15:32:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: zf
[15:33:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry.
[15:33:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What I meant to say was that I reduced the filterable significantly, but now I have to figure out how to make the demo page work again, while minimizing changes to the library.
[15:34:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: textinput may need an "inset" option, or at least a class you can add to the wrapper so that it's not inset. Otherwise filtering a non-inset listview looks bad.
[15:34:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but I think that's going to be a quest for another day.
