[05:39:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im looking at it but it will be a bit lots of changes 
[05:41:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: did we deprecate adding the back button or just auto enhancement of buttons you put there?
[05:59:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: autoenhancement is deprecated, but not the back button.

[07:08:58] <manus> Hey folks, quick minor question of the day from me. Is there any particular reason that there are some comment blocks in jQuery UI that seem to have JSDoc annotations but which start with /* instead of the expected /** ? Is that intentional?
[07:10:07] <manus> e.g.: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/datepicker.js#L166-169
[07:15:03] <manus> seems like the jQuery core source uses the proper two-asterisk JSDoc comment opening
[07:16:15] <manus> if it's something that you wouldn't mind being fixed, I can make a pull request
[07:37:02] <tj_vantoll> manus: Datepicker is being rewritten and doesn't adhere to many of our current standards: http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#comments
[07:37:40] <manus> tj_vantoll: ok, thanks for the response
[07:38:46] <tj_vantoll> np
[08:33:11] <gseguin> arschmitz: Happy Birthday, hope it's a good one!
[08:33:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: thanks!
[09:20:53] <rxaviers> fnagel, yeap, kb changes hat colors just fine
[09:21:42] <rxaviers> tj_vantoll, Im referring to http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/dropdownlist/index.html
[09:23:53] <fnagel> rxaviers: what does hat colors just fine mean?
[09:24:24] <rxaviers> we are talking about the widget that selects hat colors and sizes, right?
[09:25:07] <fnagel> Ahhh, I thought you are reporting a bug for UI selectmenu :-)
[09:26:09] <rxaviers>  /o\ sorry about the confusion
[09:26:19] <fnagel> no problem
