[07:30:59] * kborchers is no longer away : Gone for 9 secs
[07:31:12] <jzaefferer> hey kborchers
[07:31:44] <kborchers> hey jzaefferer
[07:34:25] <jzaefferer> btw. gnarf I just "commited" your view fix, highlight another area where a puppet setup may avoid awkward identifiy theft: https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org/commit/f9dba0531140b2add74bcc69ac975d9c15d73ed2
[07:34:26] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on web-view-jquery-org by jeresig (1m, 8s ago): Use fetch instead of pull to avoid merge conflicts or whatever (gnarf's fix)
[07:34:57] <jzaefferer> "by jeresig", except not really...
[07:35:20] <jzaefferer> so kborchers, are you catching up on regular work, or are you on UI stuff?
[07:36:15] <kborchers> been catching up at work but may look at some popup stuff today. u need me on anything specific?
[07:39:13] <jzaefferer> popup is fine
[07:42:11] <kborchers> cool, i'll probably work on some stuff this afteroon. anything specific you want to see in the FB header notification demo? anything i have seen on FB closes the popup and goes to another page so not sure what you meant by "Contained content must work normally, not close the popup unexpectedly."
[08:29:02] <kborchers> jzaefferer ^^
[08:35:00] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I tried to use popup for something like that, and had the issue of the popup getting close and ignoring the link click
[08:35:07] <jzaefferer> that's what I was referring to
[08:35:33] <kborchers> gotcha, thanks
[08:42:48] <gnarf> jzaefferer: hrm
[08:44:51] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html
[08:44:58] <gnarf> does the mouse interactions there feel any better?
[08:45:10] <gnarf> I can't seem to find a good way to let the "first" mouse click select a field
[08:45:29] <gnarf> but I did make the "first" mouse click select the last selected field
[08:48:10] <jzaefferer> gnarf: well, expected behaviour would be to select the field where I actually click
[08:48:23] <gnarf> it does that on subsequent clicks
[08:48:33] <gnarf> but I spent like an hour on the plane trying to get the "first click" to do that
[08:48:37] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:48:38] <gnarf> and i don't think I can
[08:49:01] <gnarf> it seemed that the first click always ended up putting the cursor at the end of the input
[08:49:01] <jzaefferer> well, its pretty close
[08:49:29] <kborchers> gnarf: i do like the mouse wheel interaction though
[08:49:56] <gnarf> kborchers: yeah, it apparently already included that - just needed to include the mousewheel plugin :)
[08:52:04] <kborchers> you guys see this? http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/what-you-should-be-excited-about-in-jquery-ui-1-9/
[08:53:03] <gnarf> heh... http://xkcd.com/961/
[09:55:49] <jzaefferer> kborchers: Dan's custom selectmenu is a bit silly :-)
[09:56:18] <jzaefferer> I should ping him, make him join this channel and communicate more with us
[09:58:19] <kborchers> i was thinking the same thing
[09:59:29] <kborchers> it's borked in Chrome. the arrow is not even in the Choose... span and you have to click the arrow for the menu to open

[11:13:16] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: hey
[11:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[11:14:32] <Dave_Stein> so i think i got the code styliing down
[11:15:05] <Dave_Stein> *styling
[11:15:25] <Dave_Stein> so i need some real next steps in draggable land
[11:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> remove the use of .disableSelection()
[11:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> use preventDefault() on mousedown
[11:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> get scrolling to work
[11:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> don't override _trigger()
[11:17:27] <Dave_Stein> okay that i took from the old one cause i wans't sure how you want triggers to be handled
[11:17:33] <Dave_Stein> *wasn't
[11:17:44] <Dave_Stein> scrolling meaning when i drag below it moves the scrollbar for user?
[11:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> try it out in various browsers right now and see what happens
[11:18:47] <Dave_Stein> okay those suggestions won't be too hard to do
[11:19:32] <Dave_Stein> but so far so good, all things considered? it was like i didn't know how to swim and you threw me in haha
[11:20:09] <Dave_Stein> do you want me to get draggable to 100% before moving to sortable? what are counting as 100% for draggable?
[11:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't had much time to check it out yet, been super busy with the conference
[11:20:58] <scott_gonzalez> I want droppable before sortable
[11:21:17] <Dave_Stein> ah yeah
[11:21:27] <Dave_Stein> howd conference go? saw lots of good tweets
[11:23:50] <Dave_Stein> including quotes from you
[11:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> it was really good
[11:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> lots of good talks
[11:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> and pretty productive outside of the talks
[11:27:02] <Dave_Stein> i think i'll end up going next year
[11:27:35] <Dave_Stein> do you go to jsconfUS?
[11:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> I went the first two years
[11:28:33] <Dave_Stein> and then it turned bad, or was it never good?
[11:29:31] <jzaefferer> hey scott_gonzalez, where's the most current and comprehensive doc on the widget factory right now?
[11:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> it was really good the first year, pretty good the second year
[11:30:19] <Dave_Stein> isnt it this ? https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs
[11:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't heard much about the third
[11:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: what Dave_Stein said
[11:30:50] <jzaefferer> thanks
[11:32:19] <jzaefferer> Dave_Stein scott_gonzalez: that doesn't cover the internal api, like _bind
[11:32:22] <jzaefferer> do we have something on that?
[11:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> no
[11:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> not yet
[11:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> there's this horribly organized doc: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[11:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on replacing that with multiple docs in the new repo
[11:34:54] <jzaefferer> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10442
[11:35:53] <jzaefferer> and with that I'll head to the airport, see you next week
[11:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> hah, there's no way .widget() will land in core
[11:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> we've also already done the "get the core team to review the widget factory" thing
[11:38:29] <rworth> I went the first and third years, liked them both
[11:38:44] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: we did?
[11:39:03] <jzaefferer> whatever
[11:39:04] <jzaefferer> later
[11:39:08] <rworth> tchau
[11:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> yes, I can probably dig up email threads that have John's feedback
[11:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> I also sat down in person with John and we wrote a version for core and he couldn't get it small enough to be happy about it being in core
[11:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> he also had crazy .sub()-like ideas back then, not sure how he feels about that now
[11:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> (this was way before .sub())
[11:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> found the thread, it was June 2009
[11:47:23] <Dave_Stein> rworth: thanks for input, i think i might go this year
[11:48:22] <rworth> also went to TXJS both times, highly recommend
[11:50:04] <rworth> Dave_Stein: scott_gonzalez: Have you guys talked yet about how the new mouse/not-called-mouse will sit below these?
[11:51:04] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:51:37] <rworth> maybe we should have a meeting on that?
[11:55:05] <rworth> or we could start discussing now since we're all here atm
[11:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like Dave Methvin to be involved in the discussion
[11:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> I also haven't done any research into all the problems we need to solve with the new implementation
[12:00:22] <DaveMethvin> (big reveal)
[12:00:24] <rworth> hey DaveMethvin
[12:00:28] <DaveMethvin> hey!
[12:00:38] <rworth> now that we have two Daves, I think we're good ;)
[12:00:58] <DaveMethvin> more is better
[12:01:17] <kborchers> hah
[12:01:46] <rworth> so Dave_Stein has started the first interaction rewrite in earnest
[12:02:19] <rworth> starting with draggable, Dave_Stein do you have that link handy?
[12:03:01] <rworth> it has its own mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, not building on the existing mouse plugin, which needs a rewrite and we need to figure out how we'll abstract and support touch
[12:03:31] <rworth> and potential anything, like scott_gonzalez mentioned something like a Wii remote shouldn't work any differently as long as it has down->move->up
[12:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> here's what I know (again, I haven't put any real time into thinking about this problem)
[12:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> interactions have start, action, and stop events
[12:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> they also potentially have events that need to be suppressed if the action occurs
[12:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> for example, you should not get a click event if you drag an element
[12:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> there may be multiple interaction systems co-existing
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., mouse + touch
[12:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> only one should ever occur at a time
[12:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> so in devices that trigger mouse and touch events side-by-side, one has to win (whichever occurs first)
[12:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> we'll probably need to normalize values across various systems
[12:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., touch events and mouse events have different properties, but the interaction plugins need to only know about whatever we standardize on
[12:14:04] <rworth> touch brings some aspects such as gestures, tap+hold
[12:14:23] <rworth> so we'd need to figure out whether these are touch-specific and should be layered on top of a generic layer
[12:14:30] <rworth> or exposed through it for advanced use cases
[12:14:53] <rworth> or if feasible, also normalize across devices
[12:15:19] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think gestures should be normalized
[12:15:20] <rworth> wycats will be a good resource there, as far as the level of abstraction
[12:15:43] <rworth> should they be touch-specific?
[12:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:15:56] <rworth> so mouse gestures are different than touch gestures
[12:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> well, it depends on the type of gesture
[12:16:35] <scott_gonzalez> there are some gestures in jQuery Mobile that are normalized
[12:16:37] <scott_gonzalez> like swipes
[12:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> but I'm pretty sure they're implemented wrong
[12:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> but devices actually behave differently because they know that their different models
[12:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> like double tapping is super common, double clicking is not
[12:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> so they actually have different semantics
[12:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> a double tap is not: tap tap doubletap, but a double click is: click click dblclick
[12:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> double tap is just doubletap, no intermediate tap events
[12:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> the interesting thing about gestures is that they start during the action
[12:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> and you should actually suppress everything until you know if you're dealing with a gesture
[12:20:47] <rworth> and is that a similar concern as mousedown, 1px mousemove, mousemove being down+move+up+click vs drag
[12:20:57] <rworth> because distance tolerance wasn't exceeded
[12:22:15] <DaveMethvin> i've been working with Windows 8 and right now MS is doing their own thing with respect to touch events
[12:22:22] <DaveMethvin> MSPointerDown/Up/Move
[12:22:24] <DaveMethvin> events
[12:22:25] <gnarf> wow crazy amount of chat
[12:22:31] * gnarf is kinda caught up
[12:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: probably?
[12:23:29] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure MS is going to support touch events at all the way Webkit does with the array of touches in the event
[12:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: tell them to go fuck themselves if they're not following the standard
[12:23:59] <DaveMethvin> what standard? you mean reality? lol
[12:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> there's a new standard
[12:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-Touch-Events-20110913/Overview.html
[12:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> Mozilla dropped their proprietary touch events
[12:26:17] <DaveMethvin> is this fresher? https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webevents/raw-file/tip/touchevents.html
[12:26:56] <DaveMethvin> like yesterday :)
[12:27:25] <DaveMethvin> get with it scott_gonzalez, you mean UI doesn't conform to the October 5 standard?
[12:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> well, if you want to read the editor's draft, then yes :-P
[12:27:49] <rworth> is what fits between start and stop "move" ? Is that what this abstraction layer is about? That's kind of how mouse works, that is "drag" or "low-level-drag" would be a better name than mouse
[12:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> short URL for working draft: http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/
[12:28:26] <rworth> or is move just one of many actions?
[12:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> yes, this layer is about single point movement
[12:28:51] <DaveMethvin> single pointer?
[12:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> pointer/finger/whatever
[12:30:28] <rworth> we currently use start and stop consistently, touch spec is start and end, is that the kind of thing we might want to be consistent on? Or because it's an abstraction layer and many specs/APIs could be sitting under it, not reason enough to rename stop to end
[12:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> I don't care about names
[12:31:28] <rworth> ok
[12:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> we should probably start with a list of interaction systems, such as mouse, touch, wiimote, kinect, whatever
[12:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> and document what the events and properties are that we care about in each
[12:32:41] <scott_gonzalez> and what we want to prevent (if anything) in each case
[12:33:09] <DaveMethvin> so how many "actions" do we hope to standardize in this abstraction?
[12:33:12] <rworth> sounds like we might have a level or two, but the lowest should be just start, move, stop. Above that, those might be used to abstract thinks like drag, swipe
[12:33:58] <rworth> mouse: drag
[12:34:29] <rworth> I think that's the only action, but we have to account for thinks like click and mousedown+mouseup with mousemove but without distance tolerance exceeded (not drag)
[12:34:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:34:48] <rworth> but any other mouse action, even a gesture, I think should be built on top of drag
[12:34:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fairly sure this will only be for one action
[12:35:11] <rworth> which at this level is not the drag part of drag-and-drop
[12:35:20] <rworth> just the pointer is moving between down and up
[12:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> but I don't think you can properly do it for touch and do gestures for touch in separate implementations
[12:36:03] <rworth> are you saying a touch gesture above this needs to know below that it's touch?
[12:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> do gestures exist in WebKit?
[12:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm saying the low level things are dependent on knowing about gestures
[12:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> like clicking a button
[12:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> the click needs to know about swipe
[12:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> in order to know if a click occurred
[12:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> even lower level
[12:37:12] <rworth> in terms of ensuring one but not both?
[12:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> the equivalent of mousedown needs to know about swipe
[12:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[12:37:23] <rworth> yup
[12:37:40] <DaveMethvin> so would you try to not deliver mousedown but give a swipe?
[12:37:58] <rworth> the problem is you want to bind to swipe
[12:38:07] <rworth> but react sooner than you might be sure it is a swipe
[12:38:16] <gnarf> well, not you but likely something above you is binding swipe
[12:38:31] <rworth> if you go all the way, you need to be able to start a swipe as early as down in case a swipe takes place
[12:38:42] <gnarf> strange problem
[12:38:42] <rworth> but cancel it if up without enough movement occurs
[12:38:47] <DaveMethvin> i see the point but seems as tricky as trying to handle doubleclick without click
[12:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> that's just the way touch works
[12:39:06] <rworth> by go all the way, I mean make the interaction as responsive as iPhone, as an example
[12:39:09] <rworth> correct
[12:39:14] <rworth> this is quite touch specific
[12:39:21] <rworth> and may be something we decide is not feasible
[12:39:40] <rworth> but is the class of thing where you can't treat all events in isolation
[12:40:12] <DaveMethvin> yep
[12:40:43] <rworth> a mouse example might be mousedown on a target, mousemove until you exceed 4px tolerance, on the 5px mousemove you might have a different target, but you want the down/start target
[12:41:41] <rworth> I wonder if tap and hold could be normalized between touch and mouse?
[12:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> we might want to move the distance and delay logic into this abstraction layer
[12:42:30] <rworth> this start+move+stop layer, or the layer above it? Caus it's in the current mouse, which is the layer we're replacing
[12:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> there aren't too many use cases for tap and hold, are there?
[12:42:57] <rworth> opening a menu?
[12:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> you wouldn't tap and hold to open a menu with a mouse
[12:43:18] <rworth> starting a drag? Thought that could be timeout or distance or both
[12:43:36] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: chrome back button?
[12:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so that's one
[12:44:57] <DaveMethvin> well, it scares me to say this but we DO have knowledge of which events are bound for all the parents of an element and we might use that to our advantage, perhaps along with event capture
[12:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> the use case that I associate tap and hold with is the keyboard
[12:45:25] <rworth> DaveMethvin: all, or just those bound with jQuery?
[12:45:37] <DaveMethvin> isn't that all of them? :P
[12:45:39] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: repeating keypress?
[12:45:54] <scott_gonzalez> what?
[12:45:57] <rworth> DaveMethvin: just making sure I know what you mean, caus I don't actually know how much we know
[12:46:11] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: sorry, you're talking about a touch keyboard
[12:46:23] <rworth> thought you switched to tap-and-hold on keyboard keyboard
[12:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> yes, touch keyboard, tap and hold for accented characters
[12:46:37] <DaveMethvin> just thinking that we might want to take a top-down approach to distinguish swipe from drag or click
[12:46:44] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: and that's a menu
[12:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> yes, but it's a very rare use case
[12:46:58] <rworth> do you have to hold to keep it open, or is that implementation dependent?
[12:47:12] <rworth> Aren't there other tap-and-hold cases with touch/iOS?
[12:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> sure, starting edit mode on the home screen
[12:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> but that's not something you see outside of touch devices
[12:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> not everything should behave the same across devices
[12:48:49] <rworth> sure
[12:49:05] <rworth> and it could also be implemented in a totally different way than this abstraction layer
[12:49:16] <rworth> even if it was interesting/needed
[12:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc1/docs/forms/switch/
[12:50:05] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: sounds like you're suggesting move is the one action, and things could be done on top of it, but not if all it can see is start, move, stop, it would need hooks into the things on and around those
[12:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> despite the fact that it's currently broken, sliding that with the mouse is a really odd behavior
[12:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> but clicking it isn't
[12:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not saying that gestures should be built on top of it
[12:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> just our single point movement interaction plugins
[12:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> what I was saying before is that I don't know if gestures can be built separately or if they'd have to live in the same file as the touch implementation of our abstraction
[12:51:47] <rworth> got it
[12:52:05] <rworth> well it sounds like we have a starting point
[12:52:41] <DaveMethvin> this is incredibly complex  http://developer.apple.com/library/IOS/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html
[12:54:40] <rworth> and what parts of touch on iOS are protected by IP?
[12:54:56] <rworth> the events? the gestures? anyone know?
[12:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> touch is a standard, IP doesn't matter
[12:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> gestures are not a standard (yet)
