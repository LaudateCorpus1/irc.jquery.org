[08:01:50] <gseguin> I'll investigate a little more before closing
[08:02:52] <arschmitz> gseguin: awesome thanks when it comes to anything build related you are the man
[08:03:57] <gseguin> definitely 1.4 code base, the bundle contains $.mobile.behaviors.optionDemultiplexer

[08:06:57] <agcolom> gseguin: I followed the exact instructions provided in the issue and I got a 1.4 alpha 1 build
[08:07:25] <gseguin> agcolom: same here
[08:07:52] <gseguin> agcolom: I even looked at the code rather than the version string and it is 1.4 code
[08:08:25] <agcolom> right, so there's no ambiguity then ;-) excellent!
[08:10:11] <gseguin> anybody looked into our weight gain?
[08:10:33] <gseguin> and if there are any diet we could go on?
[08:10:41] <agcolom> gseguin: btw, I uploaded last week's minutes, abd I've got you down as attending the meeting but I have no update for you. Is that normal?
[08:10:57] <gseguin> yeah
[08:11:06] <agcolom> ok, just checking :-)
[08:11:07] <gseguin> there was no update from me
[08:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> MS Open Tech is working on Pointer Events for Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=822898
[08:12:04] <agcolom> uGoMobi: when someone is present at a meeting but has no update, should we have an entry as "no update" under their name to avoid ambiguity?
[08:12:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^ how do you deal with this situation?
[08:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> I deal with it by not listing people.
[08:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> The updates are about the projects, not the people.
[08:13:13] <agcolom> ok
[08:13:51] <arschmitz> gseguin: im seeing the problem they reported
[08:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> IE11 final with have unprefixed Pointer Events.
[08:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> IE11 final will ship before end of year.
[08:16:15] <gseguin> arschmitz: WAT?
[08:16:19] <gseguin> arschmitz: how?
[08:16:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: yup both code and version string are 1.3.2
[08:16:40] <gseguin> what did you select?
[08:16:52] <arschmitz> gseguin: did exactly what they said in issue went to builder selected 1.4.0 alpha 1
[08:17:07] <arschmitz> then check touch and hit download
[08:17:39] <gseguin> arschmitz: when you switch branch did you notice the ui change ?
[08:17:51] <arschmitz> not sure
[08:18:15] <gseguin> got it
[08:18:19] <gseguin> reopening
[08:18:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes it changes
[08:18:48] <arschmitz> and reproduced a second time also
[08:19:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: am i crazy or do i recall them working on it for webkit also?

[08:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yup, they did the initial implementation for WebKit as well.
[08:21:32] <arschmitz> nice so with auto updates should basicly just be ie 7/8 without native pointer events soon
[08:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:21:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: well and mobile devices
[08:22:18] <agcolom> we have a very strange issue with Chrome on the api.jquerymobile.com site
[08:22:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: do tell
[08:23:07] <agcolom> oh no, it's will all browsers!
[08:23:37] <agcolom> if you go to a page, there, say http://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/ after loading, the page scrolls down!
[08:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That's jQuery Mobile being dumb.
[08:23:57] <arschmitz> agcolom: oh that one yea not much we can do
[08:24:20] <arschmitz> its because JQM sets focus
[08:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm surprised you hadn't noticed it before. It happens on pretty much every single page.
[08:24:28] <arschmitz> in the iframes
[08:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's super annoying.
[08:24:34] <gseguin> ok, I think I know what's going on arschmitz
[08:24:41] <gseguin> hash collision
[08:24:48] <gseguin> because I'm a moron
[08:25:05] <agcolom> so it goes to the 1st iframe?
[08:25:18] <gseguin> I didn't put the version in the object I hash
[08:25:30] <agcolom> no, it's not even the 1st iframe...
[08:25:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: i think its the last one to load
[08:25:55] <arschmitz> which could be any of them 
[08:25:59] <agcolom> yes, seems to be the last one
[08:26:13] <agcolom> that is mad! 
[08:26:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: yea its annoying
[08:27:22] <Wilto> who called jquery mobile dumb
[08:27:51] <agcolom> hey Wilto! Hope you'll have a great time in Paris :-) It's a beautiful city...
[08:28:05] <Wilto> Argh, man, I dunno how that’s gonna work…
[08:28:41] <Wilto> Flying around the world on my own dime just to have a web standards meeting doesn’t really seem… developer-friendly.
[08:29:11] <agcolom> no... that's why you need to make the most of it!
[08:30:12] <Wilto> That part is awfully tempting.
[08:32:13] <agcolom> are we meant to have this available: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/experiments/api-viewer/docs/focus/
[08:33:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: this is the first time i have ever seen it
[08:34:01] <agcolom> me too... and this one even says jquery UI in the title: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/docs/
[08:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> You should just kill /demos/*
[08:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> If you're going to have demos on the main site, they should be for the latest stable version.
[08:37:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: all that should go away
[08:37:22] <arschmitz> agcolom: its all on view now
[08:37:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: though a redirect would be good
[08:37:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.0a1/experiments/api-viewer/docs/focus/
[08:38:07] <agcolom> yes, just thought I'd point it out as only just came across it...
[08:38:29] <agcolom> yes, we only need this in one location... 
[08:38:33] <arschmitz> agcolom: cool yeah we need to redirect anything going to /demos/ to view i think
[08:39:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: agcolom: i dont even see the need to have latest version demos on jquerymobile.com just a link to that tag on view.jquerymobile.com what do you think?
[08:40:34] <agcolom> I'm ultra stressed about something at home, so cannot think right now :-) 
[08:41:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: oh yeah dont worry at all then hope everything is OK!
[08:41:40] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[08:41:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no update sounds fine
[08:42:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am here now

[08:42:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: will add that this evening or tomorrow... 
[08:42:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks!

[08:43:37] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[08:44:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I had to introduce option filterTheme into the filterable backcompat because it was available in 1.3.x.
[08:44:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It sets the theme on the textinput :/
[08:44:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[08:44:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, that's another thing we have to add to the list of things we deprecate.
[08:44:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Made an issue about it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6251
[08:44:57] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6251 by gabrielschulhof (59m 55s ago): Deprecate data-filter-theme
[08:45:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't we just deprecate the whole thing?
[08:45:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Dunno where we deprecate things.
[08:45:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the API documentation
[08:45:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but as far as end-users are concerned we're deprecating the option, not the extension.
[08:45:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, because we have that list in the wiki as well.
[08:45:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I still edit that list now that 1.4.0 alpha is out?
[08:46:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I used that for the blog post
[08:46:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so I'll add this option to that list.
[08:46:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I guess officially deprecating something is done by a note in the documentation 
[08:46:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, I know. We must go over the API docs once we're in beta.
[08:47:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok sounds good, we can go thrue whole list when we update the docs
[08:47:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, for sure.
[08:47:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we also should do a search for "deprecate" or "TODO" in the code
[08:47:46] <uGoMobi> comments I mean
[08:47:56] <uGoMobi> to see if we didn't miss anything
[08:48:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Cool!
[08:48:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: last time i started looking at those i found stuff still in the library that was removed prior to 1.0
[08:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz agcolom: Yup, either latest or none, since we have view.
[08:48:37] <uGoMobi> lol arschmitz 
[08:48:41] <uGoMobi> about time then

[08:51:22] <_|Nix|_> I wish I could say "leaner and meaner". 
[08:51:34] <agcolom> arschmitz: is it not possible to prevent the scrolling using preventDefault? (so we would want to allow scrolling only when people manually scroll or when they click/touch one of the quickNav options)
[08:51:45] <_|Nix|_> You can argue "meaner" but "leaner" ... well ...
[08:52:18] <Wilto> Hey, “meaner but less lean” has worked well for me personally over the years.
[08:52:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: to be honest i have not really put to much thought into the issue just been annoyed by it lol
[08:52:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I can relate.
[08:53:27] <agcolom> arschmitz: I'll open an issue... because I think it would be worth trying to solve...
[08:53:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah for sure its annoying
[08:54:16] <tj_vantoll> agcolom: One thing I've done in demos previously to avoid this is $.fn.focus = $.noop;
[08:54:16] <tj_vantoll> http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/dm9rZ/
[08:54:35] <Wilto> Figures. I show up and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6249 appears.
[08:54:36] <b-ot> Wilto: Issue #6249 by jonathannaguin (3h 15m ago): Gap of 1 pixel on top of the fixed header bar [Android]
[08:54:39] <agcolom> tj_vantoll: Thanks!
[08:54:45] <tj_vantoll> Hacky but it works.
[08:55:05] <arschmitz> tj_vantoll: yeah thats actually not a bad idea in this case for examples
[08:55:28] <arschmitz> Wilto: they already closed it them selves 
[08:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> There are a few issues with that.
[08:55:39] <Wilto> My work here is done.
[08:55:57] <scott_gonzalez> 1) You need to restore .focus() to the real implementation after load so the demos actually work when setting focus programatically.
[08:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> 2) The hack will show up in the "view source" section.
[08:56:20] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah thats ugly
[08:57:30] <tj_vantoll> Definitely hacky and not something you can go globally. The demos on that page have no "view source" http://api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/.
[08:58:23] <tj_vantoll> I'm just saying that's really the only way you're going to prevent that from happening. You can't globally sniff to prevent that, it would have to be something done in each demo.
[08:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> We should just change Mobile to not set focus.
[08:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> Why is it happening?
[08:59:37] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so that focus is not set to something that hidden
[08:59:45] <arschmitz> because of the page model
[08:59:46] <_|Nix|_>  scott_gonzalez: I think we scrollTo(0, 1) at some point.
[09:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> Scrolling does not set focus.
[09:00:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we need to add more code to recognize that we are in an iFrame.
[09:00:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: if you have multiple pages and initally load the second one you dont want focus set to something on first one
[09:00:31] <uGoMobi> I think when a page has display none its content can't get focus either
[09:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: The browser won't set focus to anything unless you tell it to. The body gets default focus.
[09:01:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: then i have no idea then thats the explanation someone gave me way way back lol its not something iv ever actually looked into 
[09:02:05] <tj_vantoll> http://api.jquerymobile.com/resources/dialog/example6.html
[09:02:18] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: BTW: I was unable to get rid of that IE hack for the popup arrow. I got it to work with CSS hacks for IE8, but not for IE9 :(
[09:02:23] <tj_vantoll> $( ":focus" ) —> <div data-role="page">
[09:03:12] <tj_vantoll> Anyways have to head out for an hour or so. Back later.
[09:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: If we're doing class-based hacks, they should just go on the body or html element on load.
[09:03:33] <scott_gonzalez> It seems really bad for a widget to be checking which browser it's in.
[09:03:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: maybe its some attempt to be similar to setting it to body  because the pages are kinda like bodys or something im pulling at straws here for justification lol
[09:04:03] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gseguin closed issue #6253: Download Builder for "1.4.0 alpha 1" provides 1.3.2  02http://git.io/ZVasww
[09:04:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: meaning it probably needs to just go away
[09:04:10] <gseguin> arschmitz: it's fixed now
[09:04:41] <arschmitz> gseguin: awesome
[09:05:01] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I suppose that would be the framework approach.
[09:05:30] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and actually we already have somthing like that. We have a class nosupport-shadow or some such that (I assume) turns off shadows.
[09:07:06] <_|Nix|_> Wait ... we don't do that anymore. Nice!
[09:08:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did our dropping IE7 make it possible for us to get rid of ui-mobile-nosupport-boxshadow?
[09:08:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that class it still ther
[09:08:36] <uGoMobi> there*
[09:08:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where is it added?
[09:08:52] <uGoMobi> I just renamed it for consistency
[09:09:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK. What's the new name?
[09:09:23] <agcolom> why does that focus issue only appears on pages with "manually added" iframes?
[09:09:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's added to html tag, ui-noboxshadow
[09:10:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: bad thing is, the addClass is in support.js
[09:10:37] <uGoMobi> I think that belongs in init.js
[09:10:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see.
[09:10:48] <agcolom> so here, we have only the example iframe and no manually added iframe that get content from the resources folder, and it's not happening: http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.silentScroll/
[09:10:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's true.
[09:11:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it possible to detect whether the browser supports CSS transforms?
[09:11:13] <agcolom> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez ^
[09:11:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we already do
[09:11:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, snap! Really?
[09:11:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 3D transforms
[09:11:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, no ... I mean the transform: translate(3px,3px)
[09:12:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or transform: anything;
[09:12:33] <uGoMobi> I don't think we test 2D transforms
[09:12:44] <agcolom> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez sorry, I meant to remove local! so the issue is not present on http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.silentScroll/
[09:12:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I didn't think so.
[09:12:47] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah i think i agree with scott_gonzalez on this we need to just lookinto removing this completely look at issues and comments i cant see a reason for it 
[09:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: There's no role="page" in that example.
[09:12:52] <uGoMobi> yes it is possible to test that
[09:12:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ^
[09:13:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm not sure if it's worth it.
[09:13:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... especially in like IE9 where transform works, but it's broken :(
[09:13:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[09:13:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we blur anything on the page before a transition so that should take care of any issues with focus being shifted out and then we set it to the title or element with autofocus set
[09:14:05] <agcolom> oh yes, that's because I changed the template! OMG. I need to go through all of the pages to put that in!
[09:14:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll just keep the hack for now.
[09:14:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: agcolom: i think this should be only set focus if we ajax something in with autofocus set
[09:14:31] <agcolom> Why is there always so much to be done!

[09:17:14] <gseguin> Wilto: you scared the bug filer just by showing up here
[09:17:29] <Wilto> All part of my plan, gseguin.
[09:17:36] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:17:40] <Wilto> “Android fixed header issues? NOT ON MY WATCH.”
[09:18:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: doesn't look like we really need $.mobile.focusPage() 
[09:18:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats what i was saying basicly
[09:18:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we could set focus on the body again
[09:18:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if we blur everything i dont think we need to set focus at all and that is done up previously before transition
[09:18:55] <uGoMobi> or would that still freak out the iframes in the api docs
[09:19:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: would still bring focus to the iframe
[09:19:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, just wasn't sure if navigating with tab key would be messed up
[09:19:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well you should not be able to tab to anything hidden
[09:19:52] <uGoMobi> true
[09:20:16] <uGoMobi> so pressing tab should bring you to first focusable element of the visible page
[09:20:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then i don't see a reason to keep it
[09:20:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i mean would need to test but i agree
[09:21:06] <uGoMobi> maybe Wilto or scottjehl__ remember why it was ever added
[09:21:45] <Wilto> That one is before my time, I think.
[09:22:23] <arschmitz> yeah git blame does not help because of past reorg in code
[09:22:55] <agcolom> arschmitz: scott_gonzalez the data-role page has just been added, and it still doesn't scroll to the example iframe...
[09:22:59] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.silentScroll/
[09:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I have no idea what's causing the focus change. I was only commenting on what others were saying.
[09:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, that example has an empty h4 in the footer.
[09:24:46] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes don't screem if you don't have an empty heading, the footer will not have the right height!
[09:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> :rageface:
[09:26:36] <agcolom> yes, unless this has been fixed?
[09:27:51] <agcolom> just tried without... you need a heading in the footer or it's like a thin line
[09:28:17] <agcolom> even if that footer is empty... maybe now would be a good time to rethink that?
[09:28:18] <lduros> is there anything preventing something like: var $box = $('.box').dialog(); $box.dialog('option', 'resize', function () { //something here });
[09:28:22] <lduros> looks like this is never triggered
[09:28:22] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: You just need to do a recursive blame.
[09:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> The GitHub UI is even designed for it :-)
[09:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> lduros: Have you looked at the documenation?
[09:29:15] <lduros> scott_gonzalez: for resize? yes
[09:29:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: dont think iv tried that before seems like a good chance to try it though
[09:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> lduros: Do you have a reduced test case showing it not working?
[09:30:19] <lduros> no
[09:30:36] <lduros> scott_gonzalez: so you're telling me it _should_ work
[09:30:37] <lduros> ok
[09:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> lduros: Yeah, that should definitely work.
[09:31:00] <lduros> ok
[09:31:12] <scott_gonzalez> If it doesn't, it's a bug. But I'd be very surprised.
[09:31:19] <lduros> right, it's probably not a bug
[09:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> lduros: Definitely works: http://jsbin.com/upufax/1/edit
[09:32:25] <lduros> hmm
[09:32:44] <lduros> sure does yeh
[09:45:57] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok after much digging i found when it was originally added
[09:46:35] <orentanay> I'm using jQueryUI accordion, each pane containing a form, and using the validate plugin to validate the forms and move to the next step. I'm getting a JS error every time I try to advance to the next pane. I'm sure I'm missing something simple, can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong? Thanks. http://pastebin.com/texzR0WQ
[09:46:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: over 3 years ago and here us the commit message ...
[09:46:43] <arschmitz> on page show, focus directs to page title, or first focusable element…
[09:46:44] <arschmitz> … if no title present. Improves a11y experience.
[09:46:56] <scott_gonzalez> orentanay: Please ask for help in #jquery.
[09:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: I can see that making sense after the initial page.
[09:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> And I can see why it would just be done all the time.
[09:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> But it sure is annoying in an iframe.
[09:48:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so maybe we should add a check in there to prevent this on initial load?
[09:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like it's not wrong on initial page load.
[09:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's just annoying when inside an iframe.
[09:49:17] <arschmitz> very
[09:49:31] <scott_gonzalez> How clean would it be to add the check?
[09:49:55] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not sure need to poke a but but i dont think it should be too bad
[09:50:14] <arschmitz> bit*
[09:52:35] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i could check if there is a "fromPage" if there is not skip this ( meaning we are not transitioning from a page to another therefor it must be first page )
[09:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> That seems clean enough to me :-)
[09:53:52] <arschmitz> cool very simple change and should fix docs
[09:59:31] <agcolom> gseguin: did you see that other issue on the builder
[09:59:33] <agcolom> ?
[10:00:24] <arschmitz> agcolom: thats an issue with the library actually flipswitch has the wrong name in the pragmas for the css file
[10:00:39] <agcolom> ah, ok
[10:00:40] <arschmitz> :(
[10:01:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: my fault it was originally called flip not flipswitch and apparently i missed changing the name in the pragmas

[12:01:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good to know i saw that one come in and was going to look at it
[12:03:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is that the cause of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6254
[12:03:04] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #6254 by iwsk416 (2h 46m ago): Panel no longer reopens after page transitions. (1.4-alpha)
[12:05:16] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi: what do you think of having the page footer have a min height of whatever it is when we have a heading inside?
[12:06:16] <agcolom> (it seems crazy to have to have an empty heading when we want no text in the footer, but the right height)
[12:07:23] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah iv run into this the down side is right now it adjust to the height of the content so if you change your font-size it will get smaller
[12:07:55] <arschmitz> agcolom: so if we changed it would only shrink down to that min height
[12:08:04] <agcolom> right... 
[12:08:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we do that already, but it could be that it needs to be updated
[12:08:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when did we start doing that?
[12:08:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is that part of the new theme?
[12:08:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think always
[12:08:45] <agcolom> currently in 1.3.2 if you have nothing in the footer, it's like a thin line
[12:08:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no
[12:09:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no header and footer have always shrunk to whatever their content height was
[12:09:24] <uGoMobi> oh wait, I misunderstood
[12:10:11] <uGoMobi> we set a min-height based on what the height will be if it only contains a heading
[12:10:31] <uGoMobi> but it could be we do this for fixed toolbars only
[12:10:34] <agcolom> is that in 1.3.2?
[12:10:44] <agcolom> ah, maybe...
[12:11:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i see them collapse with both fixed and not fixed
[12:11:29] <uGoMobi> hmm, ignore that ... we only seem to set page padding based on that
[12:13:05] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/uciwaz/1/edit
[12:15:57] <uGoMobi> what would it fix if we add min-height?
[12:17:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it would just make the header footer have a min height so you dont have to put an empty heading in them if you want to have an empty header or footer
[12:17:39] <uGoMobi> why would you want to have an empty header or footer?
[12:17:56] <arschmitz> visual element
[12:18:04] <arschmitz> to make it more "app like"
[12:18:24] <arschmitz> or if you have one with absolute position elements
[12:18:41] <arschmitz> not saying we should those are just use cases
[12:18:58] <uGoMobi> yeah if you only have buttons but no heading it won't get a height
[12:19:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:19:25] <arschmitz> its easy to work around but generally annoying 
[12:19:47] <arschmitz> iv run into it a bunch of times with different projects and agcolom did in docs
[12:21:20] <uGoMobi> let's use the :empty pseudo selector
[12:21:33] <arschmitz> ok
[12:21:34] <uGoMobi> won't work on IE8
[12:21:49] <uGoMobi> but i don't think that's a problem
[12:22:05] <arschmitz> ok
[12:22:19] <uGoMobi> with :empty you can still have a smaller header or footer if you want that
[12:22:26] <uGoMobi> without the need to override
[12:22:31] <arschmitz> nice i like that
[12:23:18] <uGoMobi> the min-height values should be the same as the default page padding we set when there are fixed toolbars
[12:23:31] <uGoMobi> but I like to check first if those are still correct
[12:23:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: those are calculated in js
[12:24:00] <arschmitz> based on toolbar height
[12:25:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, but we also set one in the CSS
[12:25:59] <uGoMobi> that is based on what it would be if you only have heading
[12:26:06] <uGoMobi> the JS override this
[12:26:12] <arschmitz> hmm didnt realize that
[12:26:13] <uGoMobi> it's sort of fallback
[12:26:38] <uGoMobi> i was confused too... thought we were setting min-height :/

[13:22:10] <Mrgoose> sup peoples
[13:22:32] <Mrgoose> any idea how i can do persistent side panel navigation so i dont have to include the html on each page?
[13:23:27] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: upgrade to 1.4
[13:23:45] <Mrgoose> yea im running 1.4 alpha
[13:23:51] <Mrgoose> didnt see what i would need to do though
[13:24:27] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: if your panel markup is outside the page you would have to enhance it yourself
[13:24:47] <uGoMobi> $( "panelSelector" ).panel();
[13:25:23] <Mrgoose> i want the panel to be displayed on everypage.  I have multiple "pages" inside one html and i want them all to use the same menu
[13:25:25] <Mrgoose> if that makes sense
[13:26:08] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: yes
[13:26:20] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: so you have panel markup outside those pages
[13:26:45] <uGoMobi> but data-role="panel" only works when the panel is inside the page
[13:27:07] * uGoMobi so you have to do $( "panelSelector" ).panel();
[13:27:30] <uGoMobi> to enhance the panel
[13:27:41] <Mrgoose> hmm
[13:27:50] <uGoMobi> we are working on a feature that will take of that
[13:27:54] <uGoMobi> but that's not in alpha
[13:28:17] <Mrgoose> so put $( "panelSelector" ).panel(); inside $(document).on('pagebeforeshow'
[13:28:43] <uGoMobi> I would use .one()
[13:28:57] <uGoMobi> only need to enhance it once
[13:29:44] <Mrgoose> ok, thanks i will give it a try
[13:29:57] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: np
[13:30:19] <uGoMobi> Mrgoose: for more support you can use the #jquery channel

[14:04:38] <gnarf>  /git/ is like the htdocs folder
[14:04:42] <gnarf> so /mobile/git/images/

[14:50:06] <gseguin> yay! Thanks gnarf!
[14:51:49] <gseguin> uGoMobi: git build is fixed
[14:52:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thanks
[14:54:21] <gseguin> uGoMobi: looks like I spoke to soon
[14:54:27] <gseguin> the Jenkins build is fixed
[14:54:53] <gseguin> the code on the cdn is still a build from 7/25
[14:55:02] <uGoMobi> hmm
[14:57:29] <gseguin> gnarf: what's the convention for git builds?
[14:57:43] <gseguin> they should live in /latest/ or /git/ ?
[15:09:21] <frequent> _|Nix|_: still around?
[15:12:31] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yep.
[15:12:46] <frequent> http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/bugs/6225/index.html
[15:12:57] <frequent> filterable "strange select"
[15:13:44] <frequent> _|Nix|_: what do we do with _refreshChildWidget when all items need to be hidden? In this case the select is without text (check console)
[15:14:54] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Hmmm ... 
[15:15:02] <frequent> _|Nix|_: Originally I hid the child widget if no options matched
[15:15:31] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I remember. I'm inclined to say that, since this is a new feature, it should be up to the dev.
[15:15:50] <_|Nix|_> frequent: However, we need a signal for when filtering is complete.
[15:16:16] <frequent> _|Nix|_: Ok. I will poke around. Thx.
[15:16:36] <_|Nix|_> frequent: However, I think that would count as new API.
[15:17:14] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hm... you mean the signal?
[15:17:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/bugs/6225/index.html What do you think? How shall we handle the case where the user filtered out all the element?
[15:17:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: elements?
[15:17:39] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Yeah, the signal.
[15:17:53] <frequent> _|Nix|_: this._destroy("now")
[15:18:23] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I don't get it.
[15:18:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the page above, filter for, like, "xxx" to get rid of all the select's options.
[15:18:53] <frequent> _|Nix|_: just kidding. when all the elements are filtered away.... we just remove the widget. job done.
[15:19:02] <_|Nix|_> :)
[15:19:55] <frequent> _|Nix|_: btw. have you heard of something that can count dom-manipulations? maybe in some debugger?
[15:20:27] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Not really. The only thing that I can think of is break-on-subtree-modification.
[15:20:32] <frequent> _|Nix|_: would be nice if I could get a "dom-manip-count" for a page being parsed akin to loading time.
[15:20:35] <frequent> hm.
[15:21:00] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Not sure if there's an API corresponding to that.
[15:21:17] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok. never mind. thx
[15:21:21] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... although there are some DOM-related native signals AFAIK.
[15:21:55] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Actually, even better than DOM-manip-count would be reflow-count.
[15:22:10] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hm...
[15:22:18] <frequent> would be a nice performance tool
[15:22:55] <_|Nix|_> frequent: For sure!
[15:26:30] <frequent> _|Nix|_: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug-paint-events/
[15:35:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: frequent : i don't think the filterable widget should handle that
[15:36:01] <uGoMobi> we could look into giving a native select a min height if it has no options
[15:36:30] <frequent> uGoMobi: mh. so height but no text?
[15:36:44] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:36:59] <uGoMobi> an eventt might be a good idea
[15:37:04] <frequent> why not.
[15:37:27] <frequent> ... thinking about the placeholder/default option...
[15:38:10] <uGoMobi> we already make sure custom select has min height when nothing is selected
[15:38:31] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok.
[15:38:35] <uGoMobi> have to see how to do it for native
[15:38:46] <uGoMobi> bit different case
[15:38:57] <frequent> allright. you want me to make a note on the issue? I will then continue with the other filterable things.
[15:39:00] <frequent> tomorrow
[15:39:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: sounds good, thanks
[15:39:37] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. then don't forget to sleep, too...
[15:39:42] <uGoMobi> lol
[15:39:48] <uGoMobi> you too frequent 
[15:39:55] <frequent> on my way...
