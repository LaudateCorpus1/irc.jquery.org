[02:47:03] <wwalser> jzaefferer: you around?
[02:49:57] <jzaefferer> wwalser: here
[02:50:08] <jzaefferer> and yeah, I need to catch up on QUnit PRs
[02:50:13] <wwalser> :D
[02:50:15] <wwalser> it's no problem
[02:50:25] <wwalser> I just pinged you because you mentioned you wanted to talk a few weeks ago in an email.
[02:50:38] <jzaefferer> it is, I want to provide more of them, but why should you if they don't get merged :-)
[02:50:51] <jzaefferer> ah
[02:51:02] <jzaefferer> can't remember if there was something in particular
[02:51:15] <jzaefferer> probably more general recruitment talk that isn't really necessary in this case :-)
[02:51:35] <jzaefferer> though it helps to get to know the people a bit, PRs don't help with that
[02:52:16] <wwalser> Eh, you get an impression about their programming, that's important. I appreciate the code reviews you give on occasion.
[02:52:41] <jzaefferer> yeah, but that's about it, nothing else
[02:52:51] <jzaefferer> I think Scott mentioned you've worked with him for some years
[02:53:17] <wwalser> Yeah, we were co-workers at the place he was at before AppendTo
[02:53:50] <wwalser> It looks like you may have wanted to talk in more depth about the jQuery Testing Team
[02:56:07] <wwalser> Seems like QUnit has healthy google results despite there being no website, and given that jQuery has a lot of higher priority stuff going on, I don't know that it should be a concern.
[02:56:19] <wwalser> All of the other priorities mapped out on the wiki seem great to me.
[02:56:58] <jzaefferer> cool
[02:57:07] <jzaefferer> well, there's a Skype group, though it isn't very active
[02:57:35] <jzaefferer> most people don't have an irc bouncer so they loose the persistence/history Skype provides when we'd move that to irc
[02:57:56] <jzaefferer> I actually have an irc cloud account and a few invites, maybe that helps a bit
[02:58:23] <jzaefferer> moving away from Skype to irc on other projects, too...
[02:58:48] <jzaefferer> as for TestSwarm/Jenkins integration, I actually made progress on that this week: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[02:59:15] <jzaefferer> next step is to figure out how to get that job to green
[02:59:32] <jzaefferer> either setup enough clients, or just configure it to expect only, say, Chrome to pass
[02:59:42] <jzaefferer> then once we have that, extend it to more clients
[02:59:56] <jzaefferer> then start adding the other UI testsuites, then Core, Mobile and QUnit
[03:00:20] <jzaefferer> and IRC integration so that bot-t can pester about failing builds
[03:03:14] <wwalser> I have actually never been involved in setting up a CI server, and I've never looked at testswarm
[03:03:31] <wwalser> I'm aware of what it does, but I've not used it myself.
[03:11:43] <wwalser> Also, I work for Atlassian, so here's an opportunity for a shameless plug of Bamboo (http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/)
[09:40:38] <mosdef100200> Hi there thought id try my luck here has anyone used bumpbox (which is a type of lightbox) i need some advice with setting classes
[09:42:26] <kborchers> mosdef100200: this channel is for discussing the development of jQuery UI. For support, stick with #jquery
[09:42:56] <mosdef100200> i am im just being cheeky trying all advice from anywhere
[09:54:43] <kborchers> jzaefferer: http://jqbug.com/ui/p419 fixes fraction test in IE and still ok in Chrome but actually breaks the fraction test in FF. Need to find a different solution i think
[12:11:03] <gnarf> hey peol - socialhapy doesn't seem to parse jqbug links yet ;)

[12:12:44] <peol> put it in the issues list on github, i'll see if i can get that sorted
[12:12:48] <gnarf> # is a bug, p# is a pull :)
[12:12:51] <peol> http://github.com/peol/socialhapy
[12:13:44] <peol> oh, they're just redirectsâ€¦
[12:13:50] * gnarf nods
[12:14:16] <peol> put it in the issue list anyway, please
[12:14:26] <peol> i won't have time to update anything for a while, hectic at work
[12:15:32] * gnarf nods
[12:16:06] <peol> gnarf: thanks!
[12:16:24] <gnarf> np, I might play with seeing if I can make a pull for it some day
[12:16:28] <gnarf> :)
[14:37:25] <peol> gnarf: don't bother, i still haven't pushed the rewrite yet, not worth spending time on the code that is there now ;)
[14:39:55] <gnarf> alright
[14:40:00] <gnarf> lemme know when you do :)
[14:42:09] <peol> i hope to do it this weekend, problem is that the dependencies needs to be modified (or rather, bugs/features fixed), i might just push it as plain dependency and no submodule for now
