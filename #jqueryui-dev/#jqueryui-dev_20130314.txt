[03:10:58] <legec> hi there
[03:11:56] <legec> " http://jqueryui.com/download/ " gives me a 502 error when I try to download the jquery-ui bundle
[03:13:12] <legec> on the download page itself, I do not see the "Theme" choice menu

[03:27:10] <Dracco> Hello everyone!
[03:27:10] <Dracco> I have problem downloading jqueryui with custom build (no matter is it basic or custom theme). After picking necessary elements I get a 502 Bad Gateway error. Any ideas what could be wrong? Modules I mark are: Core, Widget, Position, Accordion, Button, Tabs, Tooltip, though not working for all marks as well.
[03:46:23] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #214: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/214/
[04:24:54] <rxaviers> last two exceptions were https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5160594
[04:32:00] <Dracco> Ok it works now :).
[05:00:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, is simple-log's source hosted somewhere? I didnt find it on github...
[05:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/node-logger
[05:32:08] <rxaviers> Af. I've searched on github for the README words. I should have tried on google as well using "". Thks
[05:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, I guess I should flesh out the package.json so that https://npmjs.org/package/simple-log is more useful
[05:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's bare because it wasn't intended to be published on npm originally.
[05:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> We were just resolving the depencdency with a git URL
[05:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> But we quickly learned about how bad that is.
[05:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> I should probably move it out of the jquery org now that it's on npm.
[05:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Download builder is good now?
[05:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> What was happening with all the errors over night?
[05:51:55] <rxaviers> nope
[05:51:56] <rxaviers> 1sec
[05:52:17] <rxaviers> plz
[06:04:46] <rxaviers> sorry for the delay
[06:05:36] <rxaviers> I focused on the last error, which I suppose is why server crashed
[06:05:54] <rxaviers> it's about caching TR images.
[06:06:50] <rxaviers> it's quick to make a fix a prevent server from keep crashing this way. Although, I still did not understand why it happened.
[06:06:54] <rxaviers> fix and*

[08:26:58] <jzaefferer> I can set a few things on fire :p
[08:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[09:16:48] <ryanneufeld> `tell scott_gonzalez I'm gonna take a look at this, https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159 but I don't know what change you made.
[09:16:48] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: Iâ€™ll tell scott_gonzalez about that.
[10:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Did you get that fixed?
[10:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> All I did was add https to the URL in config.json.
[10:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: No issues since that last deploy, right?
[10:40:59] <rxaviers> right
[10:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:41:05] <rxaviers> :)
[10:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna do one more dry run for the release.
[10:42:17] <rxaviers> ok
[10:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so this base theme still existing actually is an issue.
[10:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> Because now it exists, but is broken.
[10:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you know how to get the base theme out of the cdn zip?
[10:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what is copying it into the zip.
[11:08:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, put me in the loop, how do you get this zip? release_themes?
[11:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> release_cdn
[11:10:09] <rxaviers> thks
[11:10:13] <rxaviers> checking
[11:14:00] <rxaviers> where are you look at dist/jquery-ui-themes-1.10.2pre.zip?
[11:14:29] <rxaviers> the above has no base to me
[11:15:55] <rxaviers> ah, jquery-ui-1.10.2pre-cdn.zip right.
[11:16:00] <rxaviers> yeap this one does.. checking
[11:19:13] <rxaviers> 		cdn_min_images: {
[11:19:13] <rxaviers> 			src: "themes/base/images/*",
[11:19:13] <rxaviers> 			strip: /^themes\/base\//,

[11:20:46] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I think this is what we need https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5163826

[11:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Are you able to do a tree comparison to verify that's the only thing that changd?
[11:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, you can just run a diff on the MANIFEST file inside the cdn directory.
[11:30:20] <rxaviers> sure ok
[11:40:01] <rxaviers> comparing MANIFEST, I see diff md5 for theme images.. investigating
[11:46:10] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, base is gone. Although, some theme images got a different md5. https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/5164062
[11:46:26] <rxaviers> I've opened some in editor and they seemed the same.
[11:46:29] <rxaviers> visually
[11:46:48] <rxaviers> sizes are the same
[11:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[11:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> If you run it again, do you get differnet md5s again?
[11:48:17] <rxaviers> let me try (i was looking its exif info..)
[11:50:34] <rxaviers> ha! It did, it's diff
[11:50:55] <rxaviers> making a 3rd run to see if they are all diff among themselves
[11:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:51:35] <rxaviers> (above I compared two post-fix-cdn MANIFEST)
[11:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> silly IM
[11:51:46] <rxaviers> yeap
[11:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, that's probably always been the case then.
[11:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> Commit that change and I'll do the release for real.
[12:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Are you committing that?
[12:01:33] <rxaviers> just did it

[12:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...probably not the best idea to run the release script on our servers.
[12:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's a super resource hog.
[12:17:38] <scott_gonzalez> At least it's on a stage.
[12:19:32] <rxaviers> :(
[12:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> We use shelljs, which makes everything act as if it were sync.
[12:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> In order to do that, it pegs the CPU.
[12:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well...

[16:41:07] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: hooray on 1.10.2!
[16:42:37] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: did you ever get around to writing a test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/054449e214449ec5578fe71bb67b9a670adac828
[16:42:37] <b-ot> mikesherov: Scott GonzÃ¡lez (1d 20h ago): Sortable: Only animate along the specified axis when reverting. Fixes #7415 - Sortable: Incorrect revert animation with axis: 'y'.
[17:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Nope. Did you see my gist?
[17:47:24] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no, but I'm writing the test for you as we speak
[17:47:46] <mikesherov> did you know that ui.position is undefined in the sortable "start" event?
[17:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> I did not.
[17:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: This is what I was trying to do for a test: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/5153256
[17:49:55] <mikesherov> hmmm
[17:51:16] <mikesherov> why are you starting on stop? don't you want to start after the assertion?
[17:51:26] <mikesherov> a failure will fail in the wrong test
[17:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> why?
[17:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> The animation should finish before the test finishes.
[17:52:16] <mikesherov> because you've started before the assertion
[17:52:26] <mikesherov> oh, duh
[17:52:27] <mikesherov> yeah
[17:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[17:52:48] <mikesherov> I always forget stop fires after the revert anim
[17:53:39] <mikesherov> oh, so then I think that's fine
[17:53:47] <mikesherov> I would also want to check ui.position
[17:54:12] <mikesherov> but there's no way to inspect ui.position during the anim cleanly
[17:54:14] <mikesherov> right?
[17:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> right
[17:54:33] <mikesherov> OK, then I think what you have is fine
[17:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't seem to work :-/
[17:54:54] <mikesherov> except, that'll fail in IE9
[17:55:03] <mikesherov> because left isn't auto there
[17:55:15] <mikesherov> IE is the only one who converts to pixel as of this moment
[17:55:24] <mikesherov> and chrome will be changing to px soon too
[17:56:41] <mikesherov> so I'll debug your test
[17:56:57] <mikesherov> because I'm testing the plain axis options at the moment
[17:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if you can figure out a proper thest, that'd be great :-)
[17:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't figure out how to do it :-(
[17:57:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^ In the tests, I suppose I should be checking ui.position if i can, and then also "visually" by inspecting css properties like you're doing
[17:58:34] <mikesherov> I didn't do that in #8792, I only checked that the events fired properly
[17:58:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the bug was only about the revert animation.
[17:58:53] <mikesherov> anyway, that's something I'll revisit later
[17:58:54] <scott_gonzalez> So ui.position isn't really relevant for that bug.
[17:58:57] <mikesherov> right
[17:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> But is relevant for testing axis.
[17:59:04] <mikesherov> right
[17:59:16] <mikesherov> in the axis test, I'll test ui.position
[17:59:24] <mikesherov> and for that bug I'll test css position
[17:59:26] <mikesherov> ok, g2g
[18:35:57] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: quick questionâ€¦ is ui.position supposed to reflect the visual position of the item? because for current sortable, the axis option only prevents styles from being appliedâ€¦ doesn't do anything to prevent mutation of ui.position
[18:35:59] <mikesherov> :-\
[18:36:23] <mikesherov> man, now I know why you wanted to ditch them completely :-\
[18:37:56] <mikesherov> anyway, I'll note it for the future
[18:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well, in 2.0, it should just force the value of ui.position because then the widget will look at that and not move it.
[18:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> But for current, we should probably just do whatever we're doing so that we don't break any code.
[18:48:13] <mikesherov> right, not going to change code to appease tests
[18:48:35] <mikesherov> I'll just make the tests test apparent visual behavior, and note that in 2.0, it'll test that AND ui.position
