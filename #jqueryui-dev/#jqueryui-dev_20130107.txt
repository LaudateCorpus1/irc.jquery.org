[05:33:46] <rxaviers> Sniff tested DB/TR on IE8 via browserStack: passed, but slow (I think due to zip shortener) -- test: (a) deselect components (b) edit theme (c) pick a themeGallery one (d) go back to download
[05:47:09] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, got a sec? Question about jquery-ui images (bkg and icons), is there a plan to support new patterns or icons?
[05:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Not any time soon.
[05:52:13] <rxaviers> ok
[05:52:57] <rxaviers> Is there a plan, in the future, to use background gradients instead of background image patterns?
[05:53:11] <rxaviers> I mean pure css instead of images
[05:54:09] <rxaviers> (this would require us to reduce/simplify the available patterns)
[05:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's a TR-feature question, I have no plans on changing anything about TR until we figure out what's going on with Mobile.
[05:56:16] <rxaviers> gnarf, ping
[05:56:19] <kborchers> rxaviers: we would still need images for IE<10 though, no?
[05:57:03] <rxaviers> perhaps falling back to images in that case
[05:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, people need to stop using TR for everything and start writing their own themes.
[05:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> Why are people not doing this?
[05:58:24] <rxaviers> I was wondering what's the ui strategy on this. Going to css gradients lets us use transitions and make cooler stuff.
[05:58:38] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: rm -r /themeroller DONE! :P
[05:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, all that does is make everyone stop using UI :-P
[05:59:06] <rxaviers> that's a strategy. It means we (jquery-ui) would focus on functionaluty instead of styles
[05:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, Bootstrap is popular because users do absolutely nothing.
[05:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Which is really sad.
[05:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> Why are there not popular hand-built Bootstrap themes?
[06:00:09] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah ‚Ä¶ maybe at some point we should invest some time in some "custom" themes to show what can be done and maybe that would inspire others?
[06:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe.
[06:01:21] <rxaviers> Bootstrap helps users with the overall layout (fluid/fixed layout, plus javascript components, plus base css for buttons, transitions and so on)
[06:01:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: might be kind of fun/cool to put together some OSX and Windows themes that look like native stuff ‚Ä¶ those seem to be popular custom themes on mobile (iOS, Android, etc.)
[06:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the thing is that I don't want us to maintain them.
[06:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> I want the community to do the work.
[06:02:56] <rxaviers> Is bootstrap a direct competitor to jquery-ui in your opinion OR a "customer" that would use jquery-ui in the js component part?
[06:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> Bootstrap is a direct competitor.
[06:03:59] <scott_gonzalez> Bootstrap will never use jQuery UI.
[06:04:05] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, maintenance wouldn't be too much fun
[06:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Bootstrap is not just CSS.
[06:05:16] <rxaviers> I think jquery-ui needs to make better use of CSS feature in the style. Like we dont use css transitions for anything
[06:05:35] <rxaviers> (well, that's another talk, just brainstorming)
[06:08:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #148: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/148/
[06:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> CSS transitions != jQuery animations
[06:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> If someone wants to use CSS transitions today, they should be able to do so easily.
[06:08:44] <kborchers> rxaviers: i think the issue again is IE ‚Ä¶ to use transitions, we would still need a fallback for IE<10 which is more stuff to maintain. also an animation is different than a transition
[06:08:49] <kborchers> yeah, what scott_gonzalez said
[06:10:22] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I'm now working on maintaining the php image code. I understood you dont want to re-deploy the whole old site in order to just use that single part. We should be able to deploy that in the DB server. Plus we should be able to possibly maintain new fixes, so to get the code into the repo. 
[06:10:39] <rxaviers> Does it sound right? Any other requirement
[06:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just moving the old code to the new repo is fine.
[06:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> The only requirement is getting rid of reliance on the old repo/site.
[06:11:18] <rxaviers> cool
[06:13:37] <rxaviers> Since it's gonna be a totally independent code (it's php not node/js, it has its own dependencies and so on), what about creating a new image.jqueryui.com repo? Does it sound good?
[06:13:54] <rxaviers> sane*
[06:14:15] <rxaviers> Or creating a new repo is not worth it
[06:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> No, keep it in download.jqueryui.com.
[06:26:30] <rxaviers> Guys about the CSS transitions vs. jQuery animations. Im not saying they are the same, neither comparing both. What I am saying is perhaps we could improve jQuery UI to take benefit of new CSS3 features. On themeroller, we have border radius available only to browsers that support it. Perhaps, we could do the same with transitions (making input focus transitioning more cool, or buttons hover transitioning  more cool, etc). jQuery in the past made im
[06:26:31] <rxaviers> possible things on IE to happen. UI has a very decent support for those old browsers and Im not saying we should drop it now. But, I'm saying we should include new features. That's what makes bootsrap so neat. It has new/nice design and features built in.
[06:34:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, gnarf, do you have the old site deploy script? (if there is any)
[06:53:12] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.6.x core build #52: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.6.x%20core/52/
[07:01:32] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I might be able to get the old site deploy script.
[07:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> I need to pull out my old laptop though :-P
[07:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta wait for it to charge a bit so I can turn it on.
[07:04:42] <rxaviers> ehhe ok thks
[07:05:14] <rxaviers> in the meanwhile Im configuring my local nginx to point to those individual files and Im testing it
[07:05:29] <rxaviers> (trying it out)
[07:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers jzaefferer: Is multi-versions already in production?
[07:11:48] <rxaviers> nope
[07:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:11:59] <rxaviers> it's on stage (without new-css commits)
[07:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> Is it good to go to production?
[07:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, I've been swamped in site work and haven't been following the updates.
[07:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> I know you and jzaefferer wanted to deploy before the 1.10 release so get actual usage.
[07:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I just ran into a problem deploying jqueryui.com.
[07:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> I checked out new-css for download.jqueryui.com, and then linked in npm.
[07:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> Checked out new-css in jqueryui.com, linked in download.jqueryui.com.
[07:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ran `grunt deploy` and it complained that download builder wasn't prepared.
[07:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> Is it not supposed to auto-prepare?
[07:20:45] <rxaviers> it should
[07:21:00] <rxaviers> thinking
[07:21:47] <rxaviers> it's tough because the error msg you get in grunt deploy isnt helpful (gruntjs stderr issue)
[07:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> I got: Error: Missing ./release/1.9.2 folder. Run `grunt prepare` first.
[07:22:22] <rxaviers> please try going in your  jqueryui.com/node_modules/download.jqueryui.com, and grun `grunt prepare` there
[07:22:47] <rxaviers> it should handle that by itself
[07:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> etch updates for jquery-ui repo
[07:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> >> Fetched repo
[07:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> Fetch updates for api.jqueryui.com repo

[07:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> >> Error checking out: error: pathspec '1.9.2' did not match any file(s) known to git.
[07:22:53] <rxaviers> :S
[07:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> Does `git fetch` grab tags?
[07:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it does.
[07:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> You need `git fetch -t`.
[07:25:02] <rxaviers> nope, it does
[07:25:14] <rxaviers> when you use -t you get a slightly different behaviour
[07:25:23] <rxaviers> -t: 
[07:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> Our tags aren't reachable from any branch heads.
[07:25:48] <rxaviers> ah
[07:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like that fixes the auto-prepare.
[07:27:19] <rxaviers> I was having trouble with -t flag
[07:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> So it was auto-preparing, but the prepare failed because it didn't have the tag.
[07:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> Like what?
[07:28:02] <rxaviers> let me recap
[07:28:42] <rxaviers>     Remove `-t` from `fetch`
[07:28:42] <rxaviers>     
[07:28:42] <rxaviers>     - From git man pages, `-t` flag lets all tags and their associated objects b
[07:28:42] <rxaviers>       downloaded. It means objects not associated to any tag is not downloaded.
[07:28:42] <rxaviers>       Removing `-t` flag to downloaded all branch objects plus their tags (which
[07:28:43] <rxaviers>       the tags we want anyway);
[07:29:11] <rxaviers> When we use `-t` flag, origin/master is not fetched
[07:30:17] <rxaviers> but, scott_gonzalez, when master is downloaded, doesnt it include 1.9.2?
[07:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: So you need both.
[07:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> You will never be able to get a new version of UI if you don't use -t.
[07:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Every release tag contains one commit that doesn't exist in any published branch.
[07:32:51] <rxaviers> but master, right?
[07:33:01] <scott_gonzalez> master doesn't contain the commits.
[07:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> The commit that creates the release doesn't exist in any branch.
[07:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's only in the tag.
[07:33:36] <rxaviers> ok, didnt realize that
[07:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> This commit only exists in 1.9.2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/7a8acc4d842a9ed512eb5cce95e309bad803fa14
[07:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> It was generated in a branch that is never pushed.
[07:34:50] <rxaviers> got it
[07:35:05] <rxaviers> So, we need to `fetch -t` and  `fetch`
[07:35:18] <rxaviers> as weird as it looks, is that right?
[07:35:54] <Boldewyn> Hi, I'm trying to find docs, what the `ui` is in event callbacks: autocomplete({ open: function(event, ui) {} })
[07:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:36:00] <rxaviers> -t to fetch tags that are not in heads. And without `-t` to download stuff not referenced by tags
[07:36:07] <rxaviers> ok
[07:36:08] <rxaviers> will fix it
[07:36:26] <Boldewyn> console.log(ui) says empty Object...
[07:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Boldewyn: It's exactly as documented on http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-open
[07:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's an empty object.
[07:38:26] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - 1.7.x core build #52: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%201.7.x%20core/52/
[07:38:30] <Boldewyn> Thanks! Then I have another question: Why? (That is, what does this empty object do?)
[07:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> It does nothing.
[07:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> All events are (event, ui)
[07:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a consistency thing.
[07:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> There will always be an object in all events.
[07:39:24] <Boldewyn> Ah, ok.
[07:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> You can attach data if you want, it'll propagate through all handlers.
[07:39:37] <Boldewyn> *remembers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEz70ClCetM*
[07:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: new-css TR looks good.
[07:41:00] <rxaviers> great ;)
[07:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing that seems a bit strange is the headers in the accordion.
[07:41:05] <Boldewyn> I thought to remember that it's some kind of reference to "the UI object", being my memory put some obscure wrapper around the UI markup.
[07:41:15] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're using <h3> so it inherits the font.
[07:41:38] <rxaviers> ah havent noticed, adding to my todo
[07:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Have the new-css change been limited to the CSS file?
[07:42:37] <rxaviers> mostly, it had one server change to remove one class
[07:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:42:45] <rxaviers> of DB, not TR
[07:43:05] <rxaviers> no client side tweaking though
[07:43:34] <rxaviers> but change parent container from "content" class to "themeroller-content" or "download-bulder-content"
[07:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: There's something strange going on in the theme section of the download page.
[07:46:28] <rxaviers> what?
[07:48:04] <scott_gonzalez> The double header.
[07:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> And double line on the bottom.
[07:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/241k3u2w0q2S
[07:49:05] <rxaviers> ah! that's because production server is not updated yet
[07:49:26] <rxaviers> theme section is fetched from there
[07:49:39] <rxaviers> I remember seeing that. Will double check
[07:49:56] <rxaviers> If you open localhost directly, that wont happen
[07:50:13] <rxaviers> Inside web-base-template, it happens
[07:50:27] <rxaviers> while prod isnt up-to-date
[07:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm using new-css in all three repos.
[07:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> So something is missing an update.
[07:54:17] <rxaviers> adding to my TODO
[07:55:31] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, on to the next thing.
[07:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> The input elements are taller than they used to be.
[07:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> So they don't line up as nicely.
[07:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> Fixing this is as simple as removing the line-height from line 49 in themeroller.css.
[07:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> But I was wondering if you added that for a reason.
[07:57:06] <Aquaguy> Hello,
[07:57:07] <Aquaguy> I was just checking the API for jQuery.post() and the shorthand example is wrong, not that the code is wrong but it's showing some <em> tags that I guess are for styling keywords
[07:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> Aquaguy: #jquery-dev not #jqueryui-dev.
[07:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> Aquaguy: Also, that's already fixed.

[07:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for reporting it though.
[07:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> In the future, you can just file an issue against that content repo.
[07:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> Or even better, you can send a pull request if you're so inclined :-)

[08:07:52] <doesallmagic> rxaviers: Fix year generation in banner testcase
[08:13:20] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, the duplicate theme header is not a bug. It's an issue of different version you're using locally and we have in production. In you local web-base-template, it's using production configurations. So, the DB page fetches theme from: "http://download.jqueryui.com/download/theme", which is an older version (which I rendered before differently)
[08:13:29] <rxaviers> I see the same thing here
[08:13:41] <rxaviers> but, when it's on stage or production, it will work properly
[08:14:51] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: in reply to our comments on wiki about preventing drag ( http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137878/Draggable ) should I be changing/removing the test for "drag callback should happen exactly once" /cc mikesherov 
[08:17:28] * rxaviers is checking the accordion headers h3 font
[08:17:42] <rxaviers> (brb in 30min)
[08:18:00] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov in regards to create should be "an event that should get fired when a draggable is created" -> shouldn't that just be automatic within interaction.js?
[08:18:27] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: yes
[08:18:31] <mikesherov> create is automatic
[08:18:38] <mikesherov> widgets have a create event
[08:19:21] <Dave_Stein> kk so not worrying about that message from you then :)
[08:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm confused. I'm using only new unreleased code. If it's broken locally, it'll be broken when we deploy.
[08:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Yeah, remove the test that checks for exactly one drag event.
[08:22:29] <Dave_Stein> kk

[09:02:46] <jzaefferer> Checking out latest db/web-base-template now
[09:04:38] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, yeah it's confusing... You know we have static and dynamic pages. The static pages are generated via `grunt deploy` and placed in the wp content folder, that's it. The dynamic portions are loaded via client not-from-the-same-hostname, but from a different one (download.jqueryui.com, or stage.download.jqueryui.com, or localhost). We define this host on the deploy time.
[09:05:29] <rxaviers> grunt deploy considers you are doing a production deploy and sets that hostname to: download.jqueryui.com. We have a trigger to identify when we're on stage. But, we don't have one for your local env.
[09:08:37] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, note that if you were browsing at the download.jqueryui.com node server, it would be different. You can define that at run time.
[09:08:53] <rxaviers> But, on WP deploy, we define that at deploy time
[09:08:59] <rxaviers> I dont know if I was clear?
[09:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Oh, ok. That makes sense.
[09:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> Line 44 of grunt.js in jqueryui.com?
[09:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> new ( require( "download.jqueryui.com" ) )( "http://download.jqueryui.com" )
[09:13:14] <rxaviers> exactly
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> So it's using the correct JS, but that JS is pulling in HTML from the server?
[09:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> And the server it's pointing to is production.
[09:13:36] <scott_gonzalez> Is that correct?
[09:13:47] <rxaviers> right
[09:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now we're on the same page :-)
[09:14:03] <rxaviers> :D
[09:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> So what you said before makes sense.
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> It explains how it can work in stage, but not local.
[09:14:39] <rxaviers> :)
[09:14:54] <rxaviers> fixing the accordion headers h3 font
[09:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Did you see my comment about the height of the inputs?
[09:16:31] <rxaviers> nope, checking
[09:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Line 49 of themeroller.js sets line-height.
[09:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes the inputs taller than they used to be.
[09:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> So they don't line up as well.
[09:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> Just removing the line-height seems to fix it.
[09:22:12] <rxaviers> ok will get there..
[09:22:24] <rxaviers> About accordion headers, I see that after new-css it's slightly bigger than previously.
[09:22:57] <rxaviers> Although, checking its styles I see all h3 styles from base have been already canceled.
[09:25:19] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI 1-9-stable - git core build #64: ABORTED in 1 min 27 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%201-9-stable%20-%20git%20core/64/
[09:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> base.css:176 font-family: klavika-web
[09:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> Might need to do: #themeroller-content h1-6 { font-family: inherit !important }
[09:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> Seems a bit ghetto though, we could just stop using headers for the accordion markup.
[09:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should just add the inherits rule.
[09:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov: Thoughts on the 1.10 release?
[09:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> Should we do an rc or just go straight to final?
[09:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> We didn't get a lot of tickets files against the beta.
[09:38:25] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: testing locally with new-css branch, where available, the "Download Theme" button on /themeroller doesn't do anything. I can click it with no effect.
[09:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> But we did get a bunch filed against 1.9.
[09:38:29] <mikesherov> rc
[09:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, anything we should get done before the rc?
[09:38:42] <kborchers> i would vote rc
[09:39:03] <jzaefferer> straight to final, then 1.10.1 a week later
[09:39:47] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: we're punting on indeterminate pb a11y right?
[09:39:52] <jzaefferer> if we do an rc, we should do it asap
[09:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: That's my plan.
[09:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: agreed, I'd like to do the grunt 0.4 review today and do the rc with it.
[09:42:29] <rxaviers> ah!! I didnt have my web-base-template updated
[09:42:33] <rxaviers> seen the font now
[09:42:36] <rxaviers> seing*
[09:43:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: what should I be testing for live deployment? web-base-content new-css will land before or after 1.10?
[09:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, ajpiano just recently made that change to the fonts.
[09:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Well, that's what ajpiano and I are trying to figure out.
[09:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> If multi versions is ready to go to production, we'd like to switch to new-css now.
[09:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> If not, we'd like to backport the new-css changes for TR.
[09:44:09] <jzaefferer> sooo test multi-version with new-css?
[09:44:46] <jzaefferer> that has the broken Download Theme link, otherwise looking good so far
[09:46:11] <rxaviers> one possible bug for that is: now TR aborts submission if it has input fields with invalid data.
[09:46:38] <rxaviers> but, the button (in that case) should display as disabled

[09:54:51] <rxaviers> (drop and re checkout locally your new-css branch of DB, plz)
[09:56:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, when you find the clicking and doing nothing "Download theme" button issue?
[09:56:19] <rxaviers> w/ default theme?
[09:57:00] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: testing locally with various new-css branches, npm link download‚Ä¶ inside jqueryui.com repo, then regular grunt deploy. Went to /download, clicked the /themeroller link down there. Then on the Download Theme button, where nothing happens
[09:57:25] <rxaviers> default theme?
[09:57:49] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:58:42] <rxaviers> do you also find that on stage.jqueryui.com ?
[09:59:25] <rxaviers> it seems it's the same issue of getting content from production which is not as up-to-date yet
[10:01:29] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, for functionality, please test the node server localhost:8088
[10:03:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: right, but that button used to work
[10:03:22] <jzaefferer> I just checked again
[10:03:43] <jzaefferer> accessing the node server directly hardly tells us if things are going to work on the WordPress site
[10:04:22] <rxaviers> something worth saying about validating TR input fields: previously, we automatically corrected input fields on keyup. Now, TR does not obtrusively change the value. But, on error, input is set to error-state (red border) and submit button is disabled.
[10:05:13] <jzaefferer> oh
[10:05:14] <jzaefferer> interesting
[10:05:28] <jzaefferer> turns out under Head/Toolbar the Icon field is red, value "ffffff"
[10:05:45] <jzaefferer> why is it initialized with an invalid value?
[10:05:56] <rxaviers> you are using old vs. new code
[10:06:07] <jzaefferer> ah, that sucks
[10:06:10] <rxaviers> haha
[10:06:14] <rxaviers> check that on node's server plz
[10:06:18] <jzaefferer> can I test against a local node server?
[10:06:20] <rxaviers> (your local)
[10:06:24] <rxaviers> sure
[10:07:02] <jzaefferer> set http://localhost:8088/ as host inside jqueruicom's grunt.js?
[10:07:16] <rxaviers> during the above validation change, I've noticed an inconsistency on color values (sometimes using hash, sometimes not)
[10:07:20] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, simlpy empty that
[10:07:42] <jzaefferer> var frontend = new ( require( "download.jqueryui.com" ) )()
[10:07:42] <jzaefferer> ?
[10:07:48] <rxaviers> yeap 
[10:07:51] <rxaviers> it may work
[10:10:54] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, ops I think you were right on setting http://localhost:8088
[10:13:26] <jzaefferer> okay, that works
[10:14:04] <rxaviers> excellent ;)
[10:14:05] <jzaefferer> there's a weird font change after both /download and /themeroller are done loading
[10:14:08] <rxaviers> any trouble plz just let me know
[10:14:21] <jzaefferer> the page "title" (between nav and page content) is changing
[10:15:21] <rxaviers> yeap, that's the lag between base and our app css load
[10:15:47] <jzaefferer> right, but the app css shouldn't change the page's css, right?
[10:16:24] <rxaviers> nope Im talking about font change
[10:17:03] <rxaviers> Is it changing the title for you?
[10:17:15] <rxaviers> page title or page h1?
[10:17:51] <rxaviers> you mean centralized h1 title
[10:26:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, issues updates. If you find anything else plz just let me know

[10:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, with those changes, new-css looks good to me.
[10:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Still testing multi-versions to see if we can push it to production?
[10:46:03] <rxaviers> On multi-versions, what I've noticed is sluggish on IE (I think due to zip shortener)
[10:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> All IE or just IE8?
[10:47:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, all IE or just <9?
[10:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not too concerned about users coming to TR using oldIE.
[10:55:31] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer keeps disappearing. Like it's night time or something :-P
[10:59:05] <jzaefferer> Multi-version looks good to me. I've tested this too often, can't tell what I might be missing now...
[10:59:34] <jzaefferer> Currently I'm wondering about the "giant" big gray bar below the main h1 on the page, above the content. Lots of whitespace...
[11:00:19] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: the name attribute issue is still there, can't click labels
[11:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That big gray bar is just part of the new styling.
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's not TR-specific.
[11:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> For example, look at http://dev.qunitjs.com/
[11:02:58] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: when I download 1.10pre, the ui-widget-overlay element overlays the entire page in the download's index.html
[11:03:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: okay, but its still odd
[11:03:19] <scott_gonzalez> We can adjust that later.
[11:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feel we'll be condensing a lot of stuff.
[11:03:34] <jzaefferer> dev.qunitjs.com doesn't load for me - do I need to add something?
[11:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/155
[11:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you use local. instead of dev.?
[11:03:50] <jzaefferer> yeah
[11:03:54] <jzaefferer> you don't?
[11:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:04:02] <jzaefferer> meh
[11:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> Never made the switch.
[11:04:15] <jzaefferer> Its not that hard :p
[11:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> You know the reason we switched to using local?
[11:05:53] <jzaefferer> dev.jquery.com did exist already, so couldn't be set up as local. now is, pointing at localhost
[11:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[11:06:16] <jzaefferer> in theory you don't need those hosts entries any more. In practice they're still useful for working offline
[11:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> So should we push multi versions to prod?
[11:13:19] <jzaefferer> So I tested multi-version with new-css, so yes to that. If we're not launching new-css, then I'd have to test DB/TR from master...
[11:13:36] <jzaefferer> also that label issue needs to get fixed first
[11:13:48] <jzaefferer> I'll log that as an issue, since Rafael missed it before, or something
[11:15:30] <jquicommit> [13download.jqueryui.com] 15jzaefferer opened issue #73: Clicks on label don't work  02http://git.io/jdrwCw
[11:15:37] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/73
[11:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so if we get the label issue fixed, we're good to deploy multi-versions + new-css?
[11:15:49] <jzaefferer> yep
[11:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[11:17:32] <jzaefferer> looking at fixing that label issue
[11:17:36] <jzaefferer> should be easy enough

[11:27:17] <rxaviers> will handle 73 soon

[11:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> Would you like to do the honors?
[11:48:21] <rxaviers> absolutely
[11:48:21] <rxaviers> :)
[11:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> Can also tag with a pre-release to pull into jqueryui.com
[11:48:38] <rxaviers> ok
[11:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've already merged new-css into master for jqueryui.com.
[11:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll be working in master again.
[11:49:07] <rxaviers> ok
[11:52:11] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: AWESOME
[11:53:26] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: I'm not sure whether this fixes a real issue or not.
[11:53:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, currently I was using origin/master as 1.10 tag, shall I update it for 1.10.0-beta.1?
[11:53:32] <Dave_Stein> neither am i! lol
[11:53:48] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Probably a good idea.
[11:53:51] <Dave_Stein> it took me like 1.5 hours to realize i needed to update the pointer position when i forced scrolltop to change
[11:54:01] <rxaviers> great
[11:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, multi-versions can handle just one release being listed, right?
[11:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> We'll want to switch it to only 1.9.2 when we deploy tomorro.w
[11:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> So we should probably update the config today.
[11:55:08] <rxaviers> yeap, whatever is in config, it will list
[11:55:22] <rxaviers> ok, so no 1.10 now. But, 1.9.2 only right
[11:55:23] <rxaviers> ok
[11:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:55:32] <rxaviers> ;)
[11:57:56] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez mikesherov with that last commit the last failing test has to do with resizable only right? i still gotta fix ie7 but whats after that then?
[11:58:15] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: then full test coverage :-)
[11:58:15] <Dave_Stein> i can't make myself finish assassins creed 3 and x-com is too buggy so i may program at home some this week :D
[11:58:52] <mikesherov> Dave_Stein: once you get the test suite passing, then we just need to hide the "new" stuff behind backCompat flag
[11:59:10] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov weren't you doing that? haha I honestly wouldn't know where to begin and i can read qunit but not sure how to write it, then again it doesn't seem too hard
[11:59:15] <Dave_Stein> also it already is behind that flag
[11:59:22] <mikesherov> Great :-)
[11:59:26] <Dave_Stein> but i got a meeting in 30 and if i dont get coffee before i'll die
[11:59:31] <Dave_Stein> i'll be back around 430-5
[11:59:32] <mikesherov> Yeah, I wasn't saying it was you needing to do that
[11:59:43] <Dave_Stein> but it was me seeing tell me what i need to do next :D
[11:59:45] <mikesherov> I was just saying that's what needs to be done.

[12:08:05] <rxaviers> now, crossing fingerss
[12:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> I thought I was on stage and the site had already deployed.
[12:08:12] <Dave_Stein> ok now im really going for coffee... was mad i forgot a semicolon
[12:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> much better
[12:10:58] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, shall we to tag jqueryui to make it on jqueryui.com too?
[12:11:47] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Not yet.
[12:11:53] <rxaviers> ok
[12:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> We need to deploy all the sites as the same time.
[12:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> We're gonna do that tomorrow.

[14:18:18] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez given that only tests remain on draggable, I suppose wednesday's agenda will be next widget for me? what do you think?
[14:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: Tests first.
[14:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> I need to get to the point where I can review draggable before we move to another widget.
[14:27:35] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: Okay I guess I'll sync more with mikesherov about it since it seemed he was gonna handle that bit, but I can obviously learn that too and go from there
[14:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> Dave_Stein: You should definitely learn to write tests.
[14:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> You can't write code without writing tests.
[14:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:28:29] <Dave_Stein> i know that's why i was just writing against existing tests but i know there are more cases than that 
[14:28:39] <Dave_Stein> at least that helper code is real nice from what i've seen
[14:28:55] <Dave_Stein> my qa guy is excited about simulate actually cause dragging really blows in selenium
[14:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> Dinner time.
[14:29:12] <Dave_Stein> early bird special? ;) eat some for me
