[06:13:24] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI build #1479: STILL UNSTABLE in 6 min 8 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI/1479/
[06:13:24] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: All: Drop support for IE7
[06:22:33] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: let's publish UI on npm, with the "jquery-plugin" keyword?
[06:23:50] <scott_gonzalez> We can discuss that.
[06:29:25] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer i would love to see all of UI published on npm as individual components with proper dependencies defined
[06:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but that's gonna suck.
[06:30:30] <jzaefferer> At least we can script publishing on npm, unlike bower
[06:30:49] <jzaefferer> Though can we start with just publishing the entire package?
[06:31:03] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't.
[06:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'd want a long term plan before publishing anything.
[06:31:26] <jzaefferer> I'm going to put that on the devleads agenda for tomorrow
[06:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> Publishing a monolith wiht no plan seems really bad.
[06:31:33] <jzaefferer> Well, next week
[06:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> We can easily screw ourselves over.
[06:33:08] <kborchers> i don't see the benefit of publishing the whole thing when most people shouldn't need the monolith. if we can get it set up right, i think only individual pieces would be better to encourage only building what you need
[06:33:19] <kborchers> though that still leaves duplicate dependency issues, right?
[06:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> Dependency issues don't matter.
[06:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> That's npm's problem.
[06:33:53] <kborchers> right but i'm sure we would still hear about it all the time
[06:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> Why?
[06:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> npm already handles this pretty weel.
[06:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> *well
[06:34:28] <kborchers> oh ok
[06:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> I think the real problem is that npm isn't designed at all for what users will be doing.
[06:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why I don't want to rush into this.
[06:35:02] <jzaefferer> We should find some people who use npm for frontend dependency management (excluding browserify, unless we want to publish uiify)
[06:35:16] <kborchers> no i don't think we should rush either but i think we should be working toward it
[06:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> If the goal is the have people actually using npm right now, that's probably unrealistic.
[06:35:38] <jzaefferer> timmy wrote grunt-npmcopy, though I don't know if he's using that exclusively for Core
[06:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> That would be painfully annoying to use.
[06:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> It puts half of the dependency management back on the end user.
[06:36:44] <jzaefferer> Well, figuring out what the other half should look like and working with npm to implement that seems like a good idea
[06:37:03] <jzaefferer> We've dropped the ball that seldo played to us
[06:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> That's already the plan.
[06:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> But that's not what you asked for just now.
[06:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> You asked for us to publish to npm.
[06:37:29] <jzaefferer> Yeah, nevermind that part, I got an interesting answer anyway
[06:40:06] <jzaefferer> Speaking of mess, is there anything we can or want to do about frontend build tools? 
[06:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to be more specific. That's a very broad topic.
[06:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> Do you mean task runners and build systems like grunt, gulp, broccoli, etc.?
[06:41:15] <jzaefferer> yes

[07:51:53] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz, cgack: I just realized something regarding the classes option.
[07:52:14] <cgack> gabriel_schulhof: what is it?
[07:52:26] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: No, wait ... I'm reconsidering.
[07:52:41] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Is there an occasion where you apply the same classes twice?
[07:52:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: what do you mean?
[07:53:00] <gabriel_schulhof> cgack: Once, because the style option has the value it has, and then again because the classes option has changed, in the same code path?
[07:53:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono ... I take it back.
[07:54:06] <gabriel_schulhof> If the classes option changes, it ends up applying classes to the element as if the style option had changed.
[07:54:32] <gabriel_schulhof> For backcompat, we must then update the value of the style option, but we must not perform the update via _setOptions, but simply assign the value.
[07:54:57] <gabriel_schulhof> ... because the corresponding class manipulation will already have happened via the classes handling in the widget factory.
[07:55:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Conversely, if the value of the style option is changed by the user, we must update the classes option, but simply by assigning a new value.
[07:56:36] <gabriel_schulhof> So, unless the user changes both the style option and the classes option in the same call, we don't end up doing twice the work.
[07:57:02] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and core short-circuits the second time anyway, because it's being told to add a class that is already added, or to remove a class that is not present.
[07:58:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Background: I'm doing the update-style-option-values-in-response-to-classes-option-changes part of the code for collapsible right now. So, it's extra confusing, because collapsible has style option inheritance from collapsible set, and it has the non-orthogonality between inset and corners.
[07:59:15] <gabriel_schulhof> So, right now you don't wanna be in my mind :)
[07:59:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: do you think thats more work or just switching to accordion?
[07:59:59] <gabriel_schulhof> Yes, please! Let's switch to accordion. Yesterday!
[08:00:15] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not even sure how backcompat is going to work there
[08:00:25] <arschmitz> we might just say well new widget 
[08:00:29] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, I'm super-proud of having figured out a systematic way of doing option inheritance, but I still wanna ditch that code :)
[08:00:29] <arschmitz> and deprecate old
[08:01:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Yeah, and not give it classes and _setOptions for classes.
[08:01:46] <arschmitz> yeah it might be the way to go
[08:02:34] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I mean I have to draw the line somewhere. It's already a lot of extra code just for backcompat, but for collapsible{,set}, it's ridiculous.
[08:05:25] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I'll skip over collapsible as I implement update-style-option-values-in-response-to-classes-option-changes for the various widgets, and, if necessary, I'll retreat to a monastery and do it for collapsible{,set} at the end.
[08:05:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: ok i just talked to scott he agrees 
[08:05:50] <arschmitz> lets just keep both for a version
[08:05:52] <arschmitz> and be done with it
[08:05:59] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[08:06:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: so when i pull in the button updates ill pull in accordion
[08:06:21] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK.
[08:06:44] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: then we can open an issue to add the css and ping jasper
[08:06:54] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[08:07:11] <gabriel_schulhof> You may have just saved my sanity.
[08:07:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Thank you!
[08:07:15] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and no backcompat worries
[08:07:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: well i talked about this WAY WAY WAY back
[08:07:34] <arschmitz> but at the time classes was not on the table yet
[08:07:39] <gabriel_schulhof> For sure, but it's good to see "insurmountable" reasons for doing it.
[08:07:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ... first hand.
[08:08:16] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and i already showed you how it actually reduces markup
[08:10:14] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. Let's do it.
[08:10:37] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: already working on it lol
[08:11:00] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: because i just finished a final round of classes updates and fixed the tests
[08:11:09] <arschmitz> so im pulling in stuff already 
[08:11:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Oh, man. Tests! Please don't forget the checkboxradio stuff, so we can fix the tests in ui-1-12 as well!
[08:12:06] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i wont 
[08:12:54] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We're gonna have to do some massive testing of all this code. Backcompat on the style options is a beast!

[08:39:17] <Omar-> lisa_deluca cordova-related  help :)
[09:10:31] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do we care if the user sets listview.listview( "options", "classes.ui-listview", "ui-corner-all" );?
[09:10:43] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Notice it has corners, but it is not inset. This will result in incorrect styling.
[09:10:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do we wanna sanitize that, or do we not care.
[09:12:36] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we should not sanatize or questions a users class choices
[09:13:06] <arschmitz> the whole point is for the user to be able to set what ever classes THEY want
[09:13:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: OK. Good. So, I'll simply update the value of the various style options depending on the presence/absence of the various classes.
[09:14:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Makes it super easy.
[09:15:25] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and in the case of listview, I need not worry about the forward case, i.e., reflect-classes-option-to-reflect-style-option-changes, because we did not have _setOptions() implemented.
[09:15:30] * gabriel_schulhof wipes his hands of listivew

[09:15:48] <Omar-> well dont gabriel_schulhof
[09:15:49] <Omar-> ;)
[09:15:53] <Omar-> done*

[09:36:41] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I was looking into classes ui-li-has-alt, ui-li-divider, and ui-li-static. Should I rename them to ui-listview-item-(has-alt|divider|static) and give each a class key?
[09:36:57] <arschmitz> yes
[09:37:03] <gabriel_schulhof> OK.
[09:37:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's probably gonna be a major review item: making sure we've covered all the classes that should have keys.
[09:39:34] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and I dread to see how it affects listview performance.
[09:40:04] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll probably use a cache for retrieving the various combinations of classes.
[09:40:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Like, classCache[ "ui-listview-item ui-listview-item-static" ] = this._classes( "ui-listview-item ui-listview-item-static" );
[09:41:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Then, I'll assign classCache[ "ui-listview-item ui-listview-item-static" ] to all those elements that need to have that particular combination of two classes.
[09:41:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That way, I avoid calling this._classes() repeatedly from the innermost loop.
[09:57:08] <arschmitz> yeah that makes sense
[10:30:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Wow! listview is already heavily optimized in exactly the way I described, i.e., the keys are the classes, but the difference is that the values are arrays of those DOM elements that are to receive the classes in the key.
[10:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10534 If this method isn't documented, can't we just drop it without a ticket?

[11:32:12] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: him im not sure
[11:42:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I should look back to how the countTheme was handled. if we were appending a xyz-[a-z] class somewhere, I can replace that with a xyz class, where all the styles are set to inherit.
[11:43:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Or even no class at all, just a selector for the element.

[11:58:04] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, NM. It has to be added a priori.
[11:59:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: So, I guess there's no point in making a class key for it, because we never add it. I will, nevertheless rename it to ui-listview-item-count ... although that's misleading because it sounds like its a count of the list items ... d'you think that's a good name?
[11:59:40] <gabriel_schulhof> ui-listview-item-count-bubble?
[12:02:12] <gabriel_schulhof> I suppose we can just specify that people now need to add ui-body-inherit by hand, just as they have already needed to add ui-li-count by hand.

[13:02:32] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: Yeah of course
[13:03:13] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: another helpful thing to do is start going through stale issues
[13:03:39] <arschmitz> look at ones with either no comments or sort by longest since updated
[13:03:46] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: okay, on it.  wasn't sure if I was being annoying there asking people if it was still an issue
[13:03:55] <arschmitz> nope
[13:04:06] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and if there is no response within a few days / week
[13:04:11] <arschmitz> ping me on them and ill close them
[13:04:25] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: sure.  Thanks, looking now
[13:05:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: awesome thanks
[13:06:23] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and if your looking for some non issue type work and your feeling ambitious you could look into doing grunt-cordova builds of the demos
[13:06:48] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I'm not allowed to look at anything under the demo directory
[13:07:13] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: can you look at build stuff?
[13:07:39] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: as long as it's not under demo.  let me verify about building files outside of demo that tell demo what to do
[13:08:06] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: ok and even if you just looked into grunt-cordova in general
[13:08:28] <arschmitz> i think it would be good to do some sort of automated jqm cordova build for testing
[13:09:33] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: tell me more about what you're thinking?  what are you thinkinga bout putting into a cordova project?  Like having each of the demo cases? so it's easy for us to test as cordova projects?
[13:09:40] <lisa_deluca> what else would be good to throw into a cordova project?
[13:10:26] <arschmitz> my main thought was to just toss the demos into a cordova wrapper since its pretty common to be able to reproduce issues there
[13:11:29] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and even for issues that cant be reproduced in the demos directly you could then at least just paste the provided code into a demo page for debugging easily
[13:12:03] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: my other thought was once we clean up our tests so they will actually pass on most devices
[13:12:19] <arschmitz> we could do a build with the tests to make sure the test suite passes while in a cordova wrapper
[13:13:25] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I like that idea.  okay, looking into what I can and can't touch
[13:13:30] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: a completely different approach id like your thoughts on is we used to use an app someone made that was just a URL bar with a webview
[13:13:44] <arschmitz> then you could actually load a jsbin in an app :)
[13:14:42] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: that would be easy enough to do.  could also just have a text input and button to load and it would reload the page with that jsbin url
[13:14:54] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: you cant reproduce all issues that way of course but a lot you can because they are just a rendering quirk of the webview rendering and nothing about cordova really 
[13:15:20] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: yea, the nice thing about having the code in the index.html though is we can use the console output to debug
[13:15:36] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yeah of course
[13:15:46] <lisa_deluca> not that we can't with jsbin... but just easier
[13:15:57] <lisa_deluca> i basically have a project i just copy and paste with new issues to test
[13:16:02] <arschmitz> it just makes it so you dont need to build a new app for a lot of things you can just load it in one you already have
[13:16:07] <lisa_deluca> pretty easy... but i can see how it'd be nice to have automatic projects created
[13:16:41] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: well your a lot more familiar with Cordova lol i have barely used it
[13:16:54] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: and when i have its been for the sole reason of debugging something for jqm
[13:17:25] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I think it'd be more valuable to create one for the test cases to see if they all pass
[13:17:45] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yeah that would have to be a much more long term thing
[13:17:58] <arschmitz> right now our full test suite wont pass on most mobile devices
[13:18:11] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: so we need to fix that first
[13:18:33] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: yea, that doesn't sound good!  
[13:18:38] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: but long term that would be the goal
[13:18:42] <lisa_deluca> the "mobile" part of "jquery-mobile" sounds broken ;)
[13:19:01] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: no its the test mostly that are broken
[13:19:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: they assume what your running in supports certain things
[13:19:53] <arschmitz> while the library checks those things and handles it properly 
[13:39:37] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: while you can continue to ping him if you want jblas has not been involved since these issues were filed 3 plus years ago and i dont think he uses JQM or anything anymore he work for adobe helping us in the VERY beginning
[13:39:53] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: I think you can safely close this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2643
[13:40:07] <lisa_deluca> looks like gabriel_schulhof suggested a close in June
[13:40:16] <lisa_deluca> arschmitz: thanks re:jblas
[13:40:47] <arschmitz> lisa_deluca: yup thank you i just closed it

[23:33:57] <rkrara> ping
[23:42:38] <rkrara> anyone here?

[23:45:26] <rkrara> hi
[23:45:58] <rkrara> I am new to IRC I came here to get some help on jquery mobile
[23:46:33] <gabriel_schulhof> rkrara: This channel is mostly for discussion among those who develop and modify jquery mobile, rather than those who use it to create applications.
[23:47:06] <gabriel_schulhof> rkrara: If you are using jquery mobile in your project, you should ask questions on #jquery.
[23:47:08] <rkrara> do you know what is the correct one
[23:47:22] <rkrara> i got it thanks
[23:47:27] <rkrara> bye
[23:47:30] <gabriel_schulhof> rkrara: However, if you think you've found a bug ...
[23:47:48] <rkrara> no i dont think its a bug
[23:47:55] <gabriel_schulhof> rkrara: OK.
