[11:14:44] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I had a question regarding the CSS dependency management
[11:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> yes?
[11:15:10] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I didn't follow the discussion and was wondering what wasn't working with Require-CSS ?
[11:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> standards
[11:15:53] <gseguin> can you elaborate ?
[11:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> RequireJS is not a spec, it's an implementation. AMD is the spec and has absolutely no mention of CSS.
[11:16:35] <gseguin> I find it better than the comment solution though because you can validate that it works from the source code
[11:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what you mean. But going even further away from real standards sounds terrible.
[11:17:47] <scott_gonzalez> What do you think you can validate from source code by using a RequireJS plugin?
[11:17:52] <gseguin> what I mean is that you don't have to build and process the special comments to verify that your CSS are included properly and that there are no typo for instance
[11:18:25] <gseguin> our comment solution works only for a built bundle
[11:19:20] <gseguin> I agree with the standard issue but I do find RequireCSS a better solution than the comment one
[11:19:37] <gseguin> the comments are not standard either
[11:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> They're not standard, but we're not breaking things by using them.
[11:21:04] <gseguin> I gotta run, let's pick up that discussion a bit later, ok?
[11:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> We are actively breaking every AMD-compliant implementation that doesn't support a specific form of CSS loading if we put it in the define().
[11:21:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: one of the biggest problems with using a require plugin is then people that just want amd the way its meant to be used have to edit files to make it work
[11:21:33] <gseguin> true that
