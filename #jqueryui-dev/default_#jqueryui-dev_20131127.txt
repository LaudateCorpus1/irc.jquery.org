[00:10:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[00:10:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[00:10:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Are we allowed to use the Nokia and Blackberry logo?
[00:11:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Talking about the new picture on the demos front page.
[00:11:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean?
[00:11:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's not a new picture
[00:11:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK.
[00:11:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's on our web site for 3 years already
[00:11:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we do need a new picture though ;-)
[00:12:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Still ... have we ever made sure it was OK to use? I guess neither Nokia nor Blackberry have complained.
[00:12:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we don't use the logo
[00:13:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we only show a device with their logo on it, that shouldn't be a problem
[00:13:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, OK ... IANAL
[00:14:01] * uGoMobi is looking up IANAL
[00:14:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: neither am I but I am sure this is ok
[00:14:22] <_|Nix|_> I Am Not A Lawyer
[00:14:27] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[00:14:29] <uGoMobi> got it :)
[00:14:54] <_|Nix|_> :)
[00:15:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was testing TR yesterday and there are issues with the "add version" script
[00:16:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we should be able to work around it though
[00:17:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: looking into it now
[00:17:16] <_|Nix|_> add version? You mean the script responsible for creating the directory jqm/<version>?
[00:17:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[00:18:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... that shouldn't hold us up though, right? ... because that's only used by us.
[00:18:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah we should be able to do it manually
[00:18:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 2 problems are clear...
[00:18:59] <uGoMobi> it looks for wrong image files
[00:19:21] <uGoMobi> and it looks for theme CSS but we don't put the theme-only CSS on the CDN anymore
[00:20:29] <uGoMobi> however, when I copy images myself and point the script at the theme CSS in my local /dist/ directory I still get an error
[00:22:03] <uGoMobi> not an error with the script but an error when using TR local
[00:22:40] <uGoMobi> saying that the theme CSS file is not OK
[00:23:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Shouldn't we remove the icon shadow demo from demos/button-markup? iconshadow is deprecated.
[00:25:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's add a deprecated note
[00:25:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[00:26:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that note could also mention we changed the default to false
[00:27:26] <_|Nix|_> Done.
[00:28:30] <uGoMobi> thanks
[00:28:38] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... "Enhanced" ... for data-enhanced="true" ... that sounds too generic ... but I can't think of anything better to call it succinctly.
[00:31:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How about we call it pre-rendered, and we say <p>See <a href="http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/#providing-pre-rendered-markup">API</a> for details.</p>
[00:32:11] <_|Nix|_> I mean, call it "Pre-rendered"
[00:32:14] <_|Nix|_> ... and all that.
[00:33:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we should never link to API docs like that
[00:34:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because when we release 1.5 the that link in the 1.4 demos points to 1.5 documentation
[00:34:36] <uGoMobi> s/the that/that/
[00:34:59] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see ...
[00:35:18] <_|Nix|_> So, ... ummm ... http://api.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/...
[00:35:19] <_|Nix|_> ?
[00:36:06] <_|Nix|_> I guess my question was more about whether we should link at all, or whether we should keep it as is and just assume people will look up what "Enhanced" means in the API docs.
[00:36:26] <_|Nix|_> But if we should link, then we should do so correctly, of course.
[00:36:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: people should look it up in API docs
[00:37:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. So I'll leave it as is.
[00:37:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's just a demo of option enhanced
[00:37:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[00:38:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I've added an ID to the <h2> for pre-rendered just in case we do want to link to it from /somewhere/
[00:38:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we should avoid having text that belongs in API docs in our demos
[00:38:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean in the API docs.
[00:39:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I agree, which is why I was thinking about a link to the API docs, rather than reproducing the explanation for "Enhanced". Note, however, that in the API docs we call it "Providing pre-rendered markup".
[00:40:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: huh, I don't see that
[00:40:55] <uGoMobi> I guess I am looking 1.3 API docs, not 1.4
[00:41:12] <uGoMobi> looking at
[00:41:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, 1.4.0 is only available locally so far ... which is bad - we should really have a live view of it ...
[00:41:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait ...  what about staging?
[00:42:36] <_|Nix|_> Nah ... that's 1.3.0 as well ...
[00:43:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I agree that would be nice
[00:45:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/proxy/browse.php?u=http://local.api.jquerymobile.com/button/#providing-pre-rendered-markup
[00:46:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I already looked at it local
[00:46:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That <h2> is from an include, so all widgets that have a working data-enhanced option include that <h2> followed by some widget-specific instructions and examples on how to structure the DOM.
[00:46:32] <uGoMobi> huh
[00:46:38] <uGoMobi> maybe I missed something
[00:47:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I changed it to <h2 id="providing-pre-rendered-markup">...</h2> in a commit a few minutes ago so you may not have the ID yet.
[00:47:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what you may have missed.
[00:48:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but the change is an ID for the h2 element?
[00:48:05] <_|Nix|_> I guess our faithful commit-reporting bot is not so faithful - partying out there with other commit-reporting bots and botesses :/
[00:48:19] <uGoMobi> lol
[00:48:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... -<h2>\n+<h2 id="...">\n
[00:48:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I pushed that change, like, 5 minutes ago.
[00:49:01] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[00:49:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one thing I notice when looking at our API docs is the lack of navigation documentation while it is our main feature
[00:49:48] <_|Nix|_> I figured data-enhanced is a new option and quite complicated compared to other options, so it might be good to be able to link directly to the explanation of how it works.
[00:50:19] <uGoMobi> sure
[00:50:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: nav docs ... right ... *sigh*
[00:51:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, we do now have docs for the page container widget ...
[00:51:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and that's basically what people should be using if they want our nav.
[00:52:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but how do they know?
[00:52:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you are on the homepage you see only a menu without navigation
[00:53:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so adding a page "Navigation" that tells you what you need to use and how would be extremely helpful
[00:53:42] <_|Nix|_> That's a good point. Maybe we should put a blurb on there about navigation and link to the pagecontainer widget.
[00:54:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, sounds like a good start
[00:54:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 
[00:54:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, the pagecontainer doc contains an example of internal pages and an explanation of AJAX loading.
[00:54:52] <uGoMobi> oops, sorry
[00:55:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it starts by explaining that smooth navigation between pages is the central concept in jQM.
[00:55:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So maybe the pagecontainer doc /is/ the navigation page you're looking for.
[00:55:59] * _|Nix|_ waves his hand
[00:57:04] <uGoMobi> grrr... was about to correct something, but now I see it is already done on master/1.3
[00:57:35] <uGoMobi> we never merge master in 1-4
[00:57:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I was kinda wondering about why we don't do that.
[00:58:04] <_|Nix|_> Why are we off working on a branch?
[00:58:24] <_|Nix|_> Issues don't auto-close that way, either.
[00:58:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I suppose we create a new branch 1-3 and then merge 1-4 in master when we release
[00:59:14] <_|Nix|_> ... and merging master now is a Mongolian clusterfsck of conflicts.
[01:00:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this is first time we release new API docs version I am not completely sure about how things are done
[01:01:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's check with scott_gonzalez later today
[01:02:36] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[01:05:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: We have to rename "page container widget" to "pagecontainer widget" 
[01:06:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that page indeed provide good info
[01:08:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then we should also rename Collapsible set widget to Collapsibleset widget
[01:09:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yup
[01:09:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't we change that name?
[01:09:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I remember there was something about it
[01:12:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the thing I wanted to change was "Page Loading widget" --> "Loader widget" but that's already done on master
[01:12:32] <uGoMobi> (just so you know)
[01:12:41] <uGoMobi> brb
[01:21:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you move "Grid layout" and "Responsive grid" from category "Miscellaneous" to "CSS framework" and remove the Miscellaneous category?
[01:23:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[01:23:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks!
[01:26:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The examples in the API docs still have double scrollbars - whenever, I suspect, the size of the iframe is too small for the contents. But why two scrollbars?

[01:29:56] <uGoMobi> lol
[01:30:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so it was also your brain that was partying with out there with other brains? ;-)

[01:31:54] <_|Nix|_> Well then, I guess it's not /all/ bad :)
[01:32:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[01:32:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the double scrollbar has to do with min-height and max-height for ui-page
[01:33:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OH, OK. I dunno why we add those things ...

[01:33:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just add them blindly, because that's how all the examples are.
[01:34:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but didn't we make pages stretch to fill the viewport, unless there's too much content, in which case a vertical scrollbar appears?
[01:34:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and if so, can we not get rid of the min-height/max-height styling?
[01:35:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, that's why we set min-height for page in the framework
[01:35:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just have to see what inline styles we added in the API docs
[01:35:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[01:38:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it are the inline styles that mess things up
[01:39:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see resources > button > example5.html for example
[01:45:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should I get rid of those?
[01:46:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I might be able to do it with a cat/awk/sed script.

[02:57:17] <kenansulayman> Hi there
[02:57:46] <kenansulayman> Quick question; we're battling with a positioning issue and don't get to fix it
[02:58:22] <kenansulayman> It's a modded tooltip and works fine (http://data.sly.mn/Sfym) but we're facing some issues inside a frame
[02:58:52] <kenansulayman> The other fields are misaligned http://data.sly.mn/Sfv4
[02:59:00] <kenansulayman> http://data.sly.mn/Sglk
[03:00:24] <kenansulayman> As positioning parameters we're using my: "left top+15", at: "left bottom", collision: "flipfit flip"
[03:02:57] <kenansulayman> Is there any technical implication here? We couldn't totally trace the issue back using the debugger; it seems jquery fails to determine the wrong coords
[03:03:26] <uGoMobi> kenansulayman: hi, you can use the #jquery channel for support
[03:05:00] <kenansulayman> hum

[04:19:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: upgrading TR custom theme from 1.3.2 to 1.4.0 works except that buttons border color becomes the same as the background color
[04:28:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Can you file an issue? I'll have a look.
[04:28:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought I saw something weird there ...
[04:29:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was just trying to find where it is calculated
[04:29:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll open a ticket
[04:30:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks! I may have an idea.
[04:31:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually this isn't an upgrade issue
[04:31:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I now see it was already the case in 1.3
[04:31:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just didn't notice because the gradient and the inner highlight
[04:33:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll open a ticket anyway because we need to decide what to do with this
[04:45:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/158
[04:53:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, do you mean that it was already an issue when upgrading from 1.2 to 1.3?
[04:54:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not really an issue
[04:54:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or do you mean that, when you drop a colour in 1.3, it gives the border the same colour as the background?
[04:54:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the TR just sets same color for background and border
[04:54:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.
[04:54:53] <uGoMobi> yes
[04:55:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm not sure what it should set ...
[04:55:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What should be the heuristic?
[04:55:09] <uGoMobi> in the 1.0-1.3 theme that was ok
[04:55:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right, I see the problem now.
[04:55:21] <uGoMobi> because we had gradients and inner highlight
[04:55:30] <uGoMobi> but with flat theme it looks bad
[04:55:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It looks weird on 1.4 ...
[04:55:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So we /should/ create some heuristic ...
[04:55:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but only for 1.4.
[04:55:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can we use same code that calculates the border color for body and page?
[04:55:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, >= 1.4
[04:56:04] <uGoMobi> right
[04:56:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Almost certainly.
[04:56:32] <uGoMobi> and we can also set same border color for up, hover and down
[04:57:45] <uGoMobi> the biggest problem is that when you upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 and you did set another border color already we shouldn't override that
[05:00:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think that's a problem. The importing of existing settings works.
[05:00:47] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[05:01:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually we shouldn't use the code that we use for page/body border colors, but the code we use for bar border color
[05:02:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a difference in contrast
[05:03:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ignore that ^^^
[05:03:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: bars get same border and background color as well, just like buttons
[05:04:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[05:04:21] <uGoMobi> it was shadow that appeared as borders to me
[05:05:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Body seems to do the right thing, but page assigns the same colour to the border as it does to the background. Is that a problem?
[05:06:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we always unset borders for page and overlay
[05:07:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but there must be a reason I added it
[05:07:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so we shouldn't even have a border colour for page.
[05:07:31] <uGoMobi> yeah, maybe
[05:07:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Probably because it started life as body, which had borders.
[05:08:17] <uGoMobi> yeah maybe
[05:10:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wouldn't worry about page getting same bg and border colors

[05:55:05] <uGoMobi> (so you can close it from commit)
[05:58:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes. Thanks for reminding me!
[06:00:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Bam! Pushed.
[06:01:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome!
[06:02:01] <_|Nix|_> We have now sharpened the weapon of choice for all the themeanators out there ... 
[06:02:08] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:03:04] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, good summary
[06:05:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it is not working for me when I upgrade a 1.3.2 custom theme
[06:06:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not working as in it doesn't set a different border color for buttons, bars and active style
[06:07:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When you upgrade a custom theme, it uses whatever border colours were defined in the original theme.
[06:08:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[06:09:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suppose I could include a check to do the heuristics if the background colour coincides with the border colour, but I dunno ... 
[06:09:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what I had in mind is that we only do that if border and background color are not the same
[06:09:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I see ...
[06:09:16] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:09:22] <_|Nix|_> I can give that a shot.
[06:09:26] <uGoMobi> cool
[06:10:57] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I see the problem ...

[06:43:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Argh! I just remembered that the destination version is not really availaible during upgrade ...
[06:44:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can make it available by threading it through to TR.initStyleArray from TR.merge ...
[07:03:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I pushed the make-sure-borders-are-different-colour modification.
[07:03:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great
[07:12:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Problem: When upgrading, the border radius on the slider button is wrong. In the demos, it's a rounded square, but in the TR it's a circle.
[07:13:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that is because when you upgrade it uses the radii from your 1.3 custom theme
[07:13:46] <uGoMobi> so that's ok I think
[07:13:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so that's expected behaviour?
[07:14:01] <_|Nix|_> OK. Great!
[07:14:37] <_|Nix|_> The same is true when downgrading, actually - even though we don't support that.

[12:37:29] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Any ideas on why I might get two code examples for the widget methods on api.jqueryui.com's 1-11 branch after I merge master in? (http://imgur.com/I9cC6JL)
[12:37:50] <tj_vantoll> The <method name="_create">…</method> block is identical in the two branches.
[12:37:53] <tj_vantoll> I did an npm install.
[12:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> Seems strange.
[12:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try locally.
[12:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> You're merging master into 1-11, right?
[12:39:09] <tj_vantoll> Yes.
[12:39:19] <tj_vantoll> jQuery.widget.xml will conflict, here's the resolved version https://gist.github.com/tjvantoll/7682814.
[12:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it looks like we changed from inline methods to includes.
[12:42:09] <tj_vantoll> Only for the common ones.
[12:42:13] <tj_vantoll> _create is not included.
[12:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> And _create() appears in the conflict area.
[12:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind.
[12:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Search confused me.
[12:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> We use _create() in the example for the widget() method.
[12:43:02] <tj_vantoll> I *should've* accounted for that when I resolved the merge. But no worries, this is driving me nuts.
[12:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I know what happened.
[12:43:27] <tj_vantoll> !
[12:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/tjvantoll/7682814#file-jquery-widget-xml-L191
[12:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> Change that to `suppress-auto-examples`
[12:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> We added the ability to have custom examples in addition to auto examples.
[12:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> So you can control them seperately now.
[12:44:34] <tj_vantoll> AH
[12:45:21] <tj_vantoll> That did it. Thanks, I totally missed that in the merge.
[12:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's easy to miss.
[12:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> Looks very similar.
[12:45:57] <tj_vantoll> Yeah thanks a lot. Who knows how long it would've taken me to figure that one out.
[12:46:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz: updated ThemeRoller is online
[12:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Martin (the XSLT guy) is going to rewrite out whole stylesheet from scratch :-)
[12:46:48] <tj_vantoll> Nice!
[12:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Make sure you rebase instead of merge.
[12:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> The 1-11 branch should merge into master with a fast forward when it's ready to land.
[12:48:58] <tj_vantoll> Whoops. Sorry I just pushed a merge :(
[12:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I see that I was just a little late on that.
[12:49:09] <tj_vantoll> I tried a rebase but it was ugly.
[12:49:31] <tj_vantoll> I went into git rebase hell and I couldn't get out.
[12:49:42] <tj_vantoll> I need to up my interactive rebase game.
[12:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> "Your branch is behind 'origin/1-11' by 115 commits, and can be fast-forwarded."
[12:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA
[12:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> I was up to date before the merge.
[12:50:52] <tj_vantoll> When I merge 1-11 into master it's still a vanilla fast-forward.
[12:51:57] <tj_vantoll> So I want to get selectmenu into 1-11.
[12:51:57] <tj_vantoll> $ git checkout 1-11
[12:51:57] <tj_vantoll> $ git rebase -i selectmenu
[12:51:58] <tj_vantoll> ?
[12:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's start with seeing if we can get rid of the merge commit.
[12:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> If you rebase now, you should get the exact same conflicts.
[12:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> Probably 2?
[12:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can force push that since this branch isn't used for anything.
[12:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> Then for selectmenu you'd:
[12:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout selectmenu
[12:54:07] <tj_vantoll> So if I'm on 1-11 and I git rebase -i master?
[12:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you don't need to -i
[12:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> Just `git rebase master`
[12:54:32] <tj_vantoll> Ok yeah the same conflict.
[12:55:35] <tj_vantoll> Seemed to have worked.
[12:55:41] <tj_vantoll> git push -f origin ?
[12:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:56:01] <tj_vantoll> ok done
[12:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> Then for selectmenu:
[12:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout selectmenu
[12:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> git rebase 1-11
[12:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> handle any conflicts
[12:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout 1-11
[12:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> git merge selectmenu
[12:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> Should result in a fast forward.
[12:56:46] <tj_vantoll> FF = no merge conflict then?
[12:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:56:54] <tj_vantoll> merge *commit* that is
[12:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> No conflicts and no commit.
[12:57:11] <tj_vantoll> Did not know that.
[12:57:19] <tj_vantoll> Related: The demos in the API docs point at specific released versions of jQuery. Felix was including selectmenu from view.jqueryui.com so they would temporarily work.
[12:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> hold on
[12:57:55] <tj_vantoll> I'm debating whether that's worth keeping or just letting them be broke.
[12:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> Just leave them broken.
[12:58:56] <tj_vantoll> Ok, I agree.
[12:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> You can test locally by changing the example template in the XSL.
[12:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Before you do the rebase, we need to pull the merge commit out of 1-11.
[12:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> Since it existed before the rebase, it stayed.
[13:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I just force pushed the removal of the merge.
[13:03:11] <tj_vantoll> Well this looks better:
[13:03:11] <tj_vantoll> $ git merge selectmenu
[13:03:11] <tj_vantoll> Updating 0406c9f..1e5cc17

[13:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> git pull
[13:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> git checkout selectmenu

[13:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> git merge selectmenu
[13:09:44] <tj_vantoll> Ok done.
[13:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:12:11] <tj_vantoll> The custom methods seem to have disappeared.
[13:12:18] <tj_vantoll> From jQuery.widget
[13:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oye
[13:12:57] <tj_vantoll> How did those get lost?
[13:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> You need to change suppress-examples to suppress-auto-examples.
[13:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> On <method>
[13:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> *methods
[13:14:18] <tj_vantoll> No somehow during this the examples are actually gone from the source.
[13:14:19] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/1-11/entries/jQuery.widget.xml#L177
[13:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA
[13:16:33] <tj_vantoll> My commits from master to add those are just missing from 1-11.
[13:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[13:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see how the rebase would've gotten rid of them.
[13:17:24] <tj_vantoll> If I merge master back in they show up.
[13:17:37] <tj_vantoll> So 1-11 has selectmenu but it lost master.
[13:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> Sure enough trying to merge master to 1-11 causes conflicts again.
[13:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> This is crazy.
[13:18:01] <tj_vantoll> I need a drink.
[13:18:07] <tj_vantoll> Ok.
[13:21:14] <tj_vantoll> I've got it.
[13:22:10] <tj_vantoll> We're good: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commits/1-11
[13:22:27] <tj_vantoll> I rebased master back into 1-11, fixed the conflicts, and force pushed.
[13:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO!
[13:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> So many force pushes for something that should be so simple.
[13:22:48] <tj_vantoll> That was significantly more painful than I was expecting :P
[13:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> No idea what went wrong there.
[13:23:16] <tj_vantoll> Anyways I learned a bit about rebasing.
[13:23:19] <tj_vantoll> Thanks for the help.
[13:23:24] <tj_vantoll> I'm done with this for now :)
[13:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for getting those updated.

[22:53:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it still possible to make changes to TR? I realized that, for some reason, in 1.3.2 the icon can be selected, whereas in 1.4.0 it cannot, even though I remember, at some point, making it selectable.
[23:04:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, this is what would have to be changed in jqm/1.4.0-rc.1/preview.html:

[23:46:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for fixing that and no problem to deploy again
[23:46:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I noticed another problem
[23:46:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's about the corner radii
[23:48:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you switch from 1.4 to 1.3 the corner radii aren't updated
[23:49:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we don't support downgrading but when you open the TR you start with 1.4 so if you want to use the TR for 1.3 you do have to switch
