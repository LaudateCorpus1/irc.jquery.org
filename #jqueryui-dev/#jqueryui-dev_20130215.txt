[06:07:30] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, we need to feed generate_theme with a built jquery-ui https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/compare/db106#L0R190
[06:07:54] <rxaviers> I've hard coded it up there to test DB side
[06:08:23] <rxaviers> Any idea how we can parameterize that?
[06:08:28] <rxaviers> (best way)
[06:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you not using distFolder?
[06:11:09] <matiasnu> Hi people! The old 1.8.16 Tabs widget show event was triggered when initializing the tabs. The "new" 1.9.2 activate event is only triggered when actually switching to a new tab. Is this by design?
[06:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> matiasnu: Yes.
[06:13:14] <matiasnu> OK, thanks.
[06:13:53] <scott_gonzalez> matiasnu: You can use the create event if you want to handle the first tab.
[06:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#added-data-to-the-create-event
[06:14:22] <matiasnu> Excellent!
[06:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, we have duplicate headers on that page.
[06:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, the code example is the same :-P
[06:15:16] <matiasnu> Haha.:)
[06:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Except it's ui.tab and ui.panel.
[06:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> Instead of ui.header and ui.panel.
[06:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jzaefferer kborchers mikesherov petersendidit rxaviers tj_vantoll: Thoughts on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9087 ?
[06:21:55] <tj_vantoll> So this is a modal, within a rich text editor, within a modal?
[06:22:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i think i'm ok with the override selector if we must but this seems silly
[06:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's a non modal popped up from the RTE which is inside a modal.
[06:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> I agree it seems silly.
[06:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not thrilled about it.
[06:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm actually thinking about just moving the existing logic to a method.
[06:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> Then this registration system can be built as an extension.
[06:23:19] <kborchers> i think i might like that better
[06:23:48] <tj_vantoll> +1
[06:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> closed: fml
[06:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> heh, we should replace cantfix with fml.
[06:25:00] <kborchers> YES
[06:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll work on that and write an extension to make sure this works.
[06:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Did you see my question about distFolder?
[06:28:32] <petersendidit> Agree with making it able to be done with and extension and not built in.  Do want to look like we support doing horible UX
[06:28:59] <rxaviers> sorry I was in the phone. And I havent.
[06:29:24] <rxaviers> this gives me the just built place? distFolder = "dist/" + grunt.template.process( grunt.config( "files.dist" ), grunt.config() )
[06:29:33] <petersendidit> Don't want to*
[06:29:51] <rxaviers> (on* the phone)
[06:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: it should
[06:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> files.dist = "<%= pkg.name %>-<%= pkg.version %>",
[06:32:10] <rxaviers> great thks
[06:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, I always try to point out how bad the UX is when tickets like this come in.

[08:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting empty images everywhere except the base theme.
[08:03:18] <rxaviers> do you have image magick installed on your box?
[08:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, probably not.
[08:03:32] <rxaviers> this is something worth DB to check before running
[08:03:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:04:09] <rxaviers> note we need imagemagick (not graphics magick)
[08:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, guess I'm going to install MacPorts...
[08:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Works much better with imagemagick installed :-P
[08:22:40] <rxaviers> cool :)
[08:22:44] <rxaviers> i will add a check
[08:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> Also, using local download builder is like a million times faster than the old system which used to make HTTP requests to PHP.
[08:23:32] <scott_gonzalez> I remember when generating the theme took minutes.

[09:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[09:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: So /themes/base still has a different structure than all other themes.
[09:59:26] <scott_gonzalez> Because that goes through the grunt build process and all other themes go through the normal process.
[09:59:44] <rxaviers> I followed the previous pattern
[09:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> Think we should just copy jquery-ui.min.css from the minified directory up one level.
[09:59:47] <rxaviers> wanna change it?
[10:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> That way we still have the old behavior of /themes/base containing EVERYTHING
[10:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> But you can still do /themes/<name>/jquery-ui.min.css for all themes.
[10:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> It seems strange to copy jquery-ui.min.css up a level based on the existing structure.
[10:00:49] <rxaviers> Ok. You wanna this only on themes bundle, or change packages too?
[10:00:56] <scott_gonzalez> But at the same time, it'd be nice to have consistency.
[10:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm really not sure which would be the best.
[10:01:18] <rxaviers> people downloads themes bundle for the themes
[10:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just leave base how it is?
[10:01:25] <rxaviers> what benefit is base in there?
[10:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but this goes up to the CDNs.
[10:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm looking in jquery-ui-1.10-1-cdn/themes
[10:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> The question really is do want people to be able to use cdn-ref/themes/<name>/jquery-ui.min.css even with base.
[10:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm leaning toward no.
[10:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> Just keep what we have right now.
[10:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Base = smoothness anyway.
[10:03:08] <rxaviers> why dont we have the same structure in base that we have for other themes?
[10:03:44] <rxaviers> only the two .css's ..
[10:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> base is actually unprocessed.
[10:04:06] <rxaviers> by the way, we have smoothness plus base
[10:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> It contains the comment tokens.
[10:04:18] <rxaviers> ok
[10:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda whacky.
[10:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's fine. If someone complains, we'll tell them to use smoothness :-P
[10:04:57] <rxaviers> :)
[10:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Or just add /minified/ to their path and continue to use base.
[10:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> I kinda wish we didn't use CDNs :-P
[10:05:58] <rxaviers> hehe
[10:06:44] <rxaviers> When I looked at it, I felt having base there in a different way we have other themes strange. But, I dont know what's people using that bundle for. So..
[10:07:06] <rxaviers> Is removing base viable? Seems more simple if people only get themes to use the themes.
[10:07:15] <rxaviers> If he want base, download the plg.
