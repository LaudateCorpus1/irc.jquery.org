[00:40:59] <gabriel_schulhof> kapil2105: You mean the clear button in the case of a native clear button? I don't believe so. My PR restricts itself to implementing the classes option.
[00:54:47] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : oh alright ..
[00:55:42] <kapil2105> gabriel_schullof : then i need to rebase my pr after when your will land
[01:19:53] <riest> Greetings, a quick question. If you have a jQuery dalog window, such as this, http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-close, and lets say you have a vertical scrollbar, eg to much text where container has a specefic height.
[01:20:12] <riest> In ie you can then use arrows up and down alongside pageup and down
[01:20:39] <riest> however in chrome / firefox you can't they just scroll the outside page
[01:20:56] <riest> Are there anyway to make the behave the same?

[05:29:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how's that for a less silly menu default demo? Also no duplicates: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/c0ebd9d95a939c8b0aaf
[05:30:36] <scott_gonzalez> Seems better :-)
[05:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> Still a little odd, since this looks like navigation and it's weird to have navigation disabled. But I think this makes more sense than the product demo.
[05:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> And of course it just cleans up the existing default demo which is good.
[05:32:09] <jzaefferer> "more sense than the product demo", which one?
[05:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I was thinking of the selectmenu product demo because of the disabled items.
[05:32:48] <scott_gonzalez> Which we still need to deal with.
[05:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to update the selectmenu default demo next?
[05:33:04] <jzaefferer> sure
[05:33:13] <jzaefferer> I'll push this to master for now

[06:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: ping
[06:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Whenever you're around, just wanted you to see this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/49c3fb74039d9e840125c20e27edf52b98cc2609#diff-5bfed97a6370101d1046df17bd23d820R365
[06:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> closeEnough() with no tolerance.
[06:05:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually comparing the difference to the message.
[06:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> I found this when switching to qunit-assert-close which has better checking.
[06:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm adjusting it to just be a tolerance of 1 like the assertions above it, since I assume that was the intention.
[06:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: heh, my commit message just got rejected because it had "Fixed bad draggable assertions." on a line.
[06:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: re: mouseenter bubbling, could just check event.target, right?
[06:17:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: compare event.currentTarget to event.target?
[06:18:05] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: and if it doesn't match, ignore?
[06:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> Sort of. You'd compare $( event.target ).closes( ".ui-menu-item" ) or something like that, right?
[06:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> *closest
[06:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> In case it's inside a span or something else.
[06:23:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that works: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/49a63a124cf2a9173d16
[06:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good (with proper spacing for array indices).
[06:26:05] <jzaefferer> and the other one that jscs caught...
[06:26:25] <jzaefferer> I guess I should write a unit test, too
[06:27:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is your amd-pr a good excuse for not touching unit tests?
[06:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> No, test changes should merge cleanly.
[06:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> I barely touch the actual tests.
[06:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> Only if they use closeEnough() or domEqual().
[06:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess also anything that uses a test helper.
[06:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> That was a recent change.
[06:30:25] <jzaefferer> doesn't look like I need those
[06:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, now I'm just waiting on my qunit-composite PR.
[06:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's the last thing for AMD tests :-)

[08:16:49] <arschmitz> i started at the top and am working my way down updating the PR and commenting as approriate

[08:18:42] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: okay
[08:24:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! Regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7927 - should I bring in a new version of UI core that has safeActiveElement & Co. ?
[08:25:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We had another bug report today about popup failure on IE, so that reminded me.
[08:25:33] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: when i update button we will get it in 1.5
[08:25:35] <arschmitz> -dev
[08:26:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Aaaah, OK. Then I can rebase https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7927 onto that and remove the implementation from mobile.
[08:26:02] <arschmitz> and im working on button as we speak
[08:26:13] <gabriel_schulhof> Excellent!
[08:26:39] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: OH i need to land that test cleanup its all ready

[08:35:25] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yes once you do that ill do esformatter updates again
[08:36:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: for textinput can you rebase that and add it to jscs and fix any errors you find?
[08:37:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the scope is limited enough it should not be too bad to fix everything in textinput
[08:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well this is really unfortunate. Sublime Text has recently decided to use all of my available RAM and randomly spike my CPU.
[08:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> Restarting the app and restarting my laptop didn't help.
[08:45:03] <arschmitz> ohhh.......
[08:45:23] <arschmitz> maybe its a good thing iv been ignoring the little popup asking me to download the latest update
[08:45:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: your on 3 now right?
[08:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> But this just started today.
[08:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> And I didn't update yesterday or today.
[08:45:53] <arschmitz> oh
[08:46:03] <arschmitz> i have not run into that yet
[08:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> I switched back to ST2 just now. I'll try using ST3 again this afternoon and only open one project at a time to see if that makes a difference.
[08:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> I just can't think of any reason it would suddenly have this issue.
[08:48:11] <arschmitz> yeah well the last couple days its been bugging me to update and i have not that was the only thing i could think of

[09:24:30] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: CPU spikes from ST3 usually come from its indexer; not sure what might have caused it all of a sudden though
[09:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> What about using 4GB of RAM?
[09:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> Also from the indexer?
[09:27:24] <jzaefferer> Not sure. When the indexer runs, there's a percent status next to the indent settings in the bottom status bar. 
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll check that out later.
[09:40:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: the latest builded added "index_workers ", a setting to limit index workers: http://www.sublimetext.com/3
[09:48:47] <jzaefferer> arschmitz scott_gonzalez: is that what you had in mind? https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/257#discussion_r27988440

[10:20:01] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It doesn't matter. It's one file per commit, and each one is guaranteed to conflict, because whitespace changes were necessary in 1.5-dev
[10:20:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: gotcha
[10:20:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and I'll probably have to make the whitespace changes again, because there's no way I'm going to edit for whitespace as I merge.
[10:20:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll let the tool tell me where it's all wrong.
[10:20:54] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:21:48] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: It's also weird how it merges some files. Sometimes it merges such that if ( typeof define === "function" && define.amd ) { does not appear in either the original context or the context of the change being applied. It just gets lost in the merge O_o

[10:41:29] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll rebase it once https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7973 lands on 1.5-dev
[10:42:45] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: did you do the rest of 7973 updating all the comments and stuff

[10:51:09] <gabriel_schulhof> Gah! Sure enough. Works fine in Chrome, fails in phantomjs :(
[10:51:35] <arschmitz> specificly whats failing?
[10:53:55] <gabriel_schulhof> ReferenceError: Can't find variable: define in tests/unit/init/dialog-load-tests.html
[10:55:28] <arschmitz> ah
[10:55:40] <arschmitz> thats one that uses /js
[10:56:17] <arschmitz> which is getting replaced with the built
[10:56:22] <arschmitz> so that tells me
[10:56:39] <arschmitz> the boiler plate is getting broken is out build
[10:57:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Nono ... I think I forgot to rebase one commit.
[10:57:44] <gabriel_schulhof> I have to get rid of references to jquery.mobile.define.js
[10:58:04] <gabriel_schulhof> .git/logs/HEAD to the rescue.
[10:58:05] <arschmitz> ok
[11:04:28] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: wow your boiler plate pr SUBSTANTIALLY changes the order of modules in the build file
[11:05:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: line 36 becomes line 3600 ha ha ha 
[11:13:47] <gabriel_schulhof> Actually, it's not that substantial in terms of files (not in terms of lines)
[11:14:08] <gabriel_schulhof> There's only a difference because of defaults no longer depending on package.json
[11:14:19] <gabriel_schulhof> It's a few files, but one or the other may have lots of lines.
[11:14:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Should really stress-test our dependencies.
[11:14:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sure i was just making sure the built file looked sane and happened to notice
[11:15:35] <arschmitz> i should add 1.5 dev to builder to test but im pretty sure this completely breaks it lol
[11:30:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hmmm ... js/jquery.mobile.js needs to retain the excludeStart/excludeEnd remarks, or else the tests break.
[11:30:56] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... because js/jquery.mobile.js itself ends up in the built file.
[11:31:09] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and that's bad, because it makes an unconditional call to require.
[11:31:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: js/jquery.mobile.js cannot really work without require.
[11:33:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: scott_gonzalez and i were talking about this yesterday
[11:33:39] <arschmitz> and that jquery.mobile.js seems very weird how it works
[11:34:00] <arschmitz> you cant just require it like you should be able to
[11:38:28] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I don't think leaving the exclude(Start|End) in js/jquery.mobile.js is a bad thing, because it influences the build process, but it doesn't influence DB - or at least it shouldn't.
[11:38:41] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and the build process is local to our repo.
[11:39:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: but jquery.mobile.js does not work like you would expect it to and if it did this would not be an issue
[11:40:41] <arschmitz> also why is that getting included at all to need the exclude
[11:41:36] <arschmitz> we should just be excluding that in the concat task
[11:43:42] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I assume it's because we use r.js, requiring jquery.mobile.js - so, naturally it is itself also getting included.
[11:44:05] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I guess we can exclude it though ...
[11:44:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[11:44:18] <gabriel_schulhof> That's how I should be doing this - not with comments.
[11:46:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, wait a second ... the configuration currently says include: [ "jquery.mobile" ]
[11:46:44] <gabriel_schulhof> So, I can't very well both include it and exclude it - can I?
[11:47:59] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: give me a few minutes to look at this 
[11:49:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Got it: { ..., include: [ "jquery.mobile" ], excludeShallow: [ "jquery.mobile" ], ... }
[11:49:39] <gabriel_schulhof> ?BOOM
[11:49:46] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or was it
[11:49:48] <gabriel_schulhof> !BOOM
[11:49:53] <gabriel_schulhof> ... can't remember anymore.
[11:50:03] <arschmitz> bots they always let you down
[11:50:05] <gabriel_schulhof> b-ot seems not to react either way ...
[11:50:37] <gabriel_schulhof> We don't even need the requirejs json plugin anymore ...
[11:51:04] <arschmitz> nope
[11:52:54] <arschmitz> then we dont need the onSave pragmas at all either
[11:55:34] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, we can get rid of the requirejs plugins altogether.
[12:00:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Got rid of onSave as well.
[12:00:23] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sounds good
[12:04:26] <gabriel_schulhof> *whew* ... tests are looking promising.
[12:04:39] <gabriel_schulhof> Hope the demo test work too ...
[12:13:22] <gabriel_schulhof> Gah ... had to restart a job because of one lousy timeout :/
[12:13:39] <gabriel_schulhof> It's green though ...
[12:15:14] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: iv been geting them randomly all day on travis
[12:15:37] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Maybe we should increase the timeout to, I dunno ... 45 seconds?
[12:15:55] <arschmitz> maybe
[12:16:01] <arschmitz> its not even like its nav though
[12:16:05] <gabriel_schulhof> If it times out then, it's definitely an exception or a syntax error.
[12:16:08] <arschmitz> its been random stuff like flipswitch
[12:16:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, I think that's because of load.
[12:16:16] <gabriel_schulhof> ... on the server.
[12:16:21] <arschmitz> yeah i think so too
[12:16:34] <arschmitz> was not happening 11pm-2am lol
[12:16:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Like, if phantomjs is taking longer than 30 seconds to start the first test, that's gotta be load.
[12:16:44] <arschmitz> yup
[12:19:52] <gabriel_schulhof> I think we can set that timeout quite liberally, because if it runs, it runs quickly and fails quickly.
[12:21:22] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:21:25] <arschmitz> try it
[12:23:44] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, let's do it on 1.5-dev after the boilerplate is merged.
[12:24:34] <gabriel_schulhof> I'll file an issue.
[12:26:25] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #8063: Build: Increase phantomjs timeout 02http://git.io/veMQm
[12:34:32] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I have to go now, but I should be able to return in about two, three hours.
[12:50:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: sounds good
[12:50:45] <arschmitz> ill be around
[13:33:34] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: when your around i think i found a dep issue
[13:41:44] <Jaxian> Hi, I was having trouble creating a ticket using bugs.jqueryui.com, and I was wondering if anyone in here might be able to help.
[14:37:13] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey! So ... a dep issue?
[14:44:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: i dont know any more
[14:44:24] <arschmitz> so just including jquery.mobile works fine
[14:44:36] <arschmitz> as long as you dont include "./transitions/visuals/pop",
[14:44:43] <arschmitz> if you do it dies
[14:48:30] <gabriel_schulhof> What do you mean by "including jquery.mobile" ?
[14:50:35] <arschmitz> in place of ../../js
[14:50:47] <arschmitz> to just get a full build
[14:50:59] <arschmitz> and avoid the need to build the js file
[14:51:19] <arschmitz> but i cant see anything different about pop
[14:52:48] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, you mean to use requirejs throughout?
[14:53:18] <arschmitz> yes
[14:53:24] <gabriel_schulhof> OK. I can look into that.
[14:53:54] <arschmitz> yeah if i make it not include the pop visual its fine its wacky
[14:54:11] <gabriel_schulhof> Alright ... that is weird ...
[14:54:29] <gabriel_schulhof> If I figure it out I'll push to 7973-boilerplate
[14:55:25] <arschmitz> oh ha ha
[14:55:27] <arschmitz> never mind
[14:55:31] <arschmitz> it was a chrome extension
[14:55:38] <arschmitz> messing with it
[14:55:51] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, wow! OK. So, no problem?
[14:56:20] <arschmitz> nope seems to be working
[14:58:31] <Jaxian> I don't suppose you'd be able to look into my issue, gabriel, or perhaps point me in the right direction?
[14:59:53] <gabriel_schulhof> Jaxian: Sorry, I dunno much about the infrastructure.
[15:00:01] <Jaxian> What if I just told you the bug?
[15:00:09] <Jaxian> It's an issue with the slider
[15:00:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Did UI end up moving the issue reporting to GH?
[15:00:38] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... or was that core? I don't remember anymore ..
[15:00:50] <arschmitz> no
[15:00:53] <arschmitz> it was core
[15:01:07] <gabriel_schulhof> OK ... then I have no idea why it might not work for Jaxian ...
[15:01:41] <Jaxian> It's possible that it's something to do with my work's firewall.
[15:01:47] <Jaxian> Seems strange, but I'm really not sure.
[15:02:07] <arschmitz> Jaxian: bugs.jqueryui.com can be slow some times but seems to be working right now
[15:02:10] <gabriel_schulhof> Jaxian: If you can, try from your phone over the cellular network.
[15:02:18] <Jaxian> Okay, let me give that a shot.
[15:09:52] <Jaxian> No, even from my phone I'm getting the same error
[15:09:54] <Jaxian> Which reads
[15:09:56] <Jaxian> Submission rejected as potential spam (Maximum number of posts per hour for this IP (127.0.0.1) exceeded)
[15:10:08] <Jaxian> (Which is, of course, not my Internet  IP)
[16:43:15] <Jaxian> I am heading home from work for now.  If anyone would like to investigate the bug I'm trying to log, here is a JSFiddle with the information:

[16:43:21] <Jaxian> Thanks for any help!
