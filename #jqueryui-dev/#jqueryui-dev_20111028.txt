[00:44:34] <gnarf> if anyone wakes up around here, please let me know, i could use your help testing some build snafus
[03:20:23] <renan_saddam> is there an ETA for 1.9?
[03:21:59] <gnarf> renan_saddam: its not going to be in the next month
[03:22:28] <gnarf> renan_saddam: probably will see a few more milestone releases before a beta
[03:24:59] <renan_saddam> I see, I was looking at the wiki but could not find such information
[03:25:19] <gnarf> we don't have a release schedule for 1.9
[05:51:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] rdworth pushed 1 new commit to grid: http://git.io/9ZaLgw
[05:51:12] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Dataviewlocal: Corrected depends - Richard D. Worth
[06:01:04] <WalterTamboer> My company wants a feature to dock dialogs. This seems like something jQuery UI could benefit from. Am I supposed to write a proposal or..? How does this work?
[06:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> build an extensions, get a ton of people to use it, then come back to us
[06:09:16] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: sounds like a dropable that accepts .ui-dialogs
[06:12:31] <kborchers> .
[06:15:13] <gnarf> ! back at ya
[06:42:32] <timmywil> so I'm reconstructing a small draggable interface. https://gist.github.com/1322291
[06:43:05] <timmywil> and im running into an issue where the lightbox will have flashes of being selected
[06:43:19] <timmywil> did ui ever run into that?
[06:44:53] <timmywil> maybe i should plug in UI draggable and see if it does the same thing
[06:47:42] <gnarf> timmywil: preventDefault your startMove
[06:48:02] <timmywil> ah good call
[06:48:23] <gnarf> timmywil: and i think in some odd ie version you also need to preventDefault every mousemove too
[06:48:44] <timmywil> i'll do both then
[06:50:19] <gnarf> ui is currently getting rid of .disableSelection in a pull i think
[06:50:36] <gnarf> there is some code to support it, search in 1-8
[06:50:41] <WalterTamboer> scott_gonzalez: I love it how you deal with community feedback. Thumbs up.
[06:51:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 4 new commits to grid: http://git.io/8QkUbA

[06:51:20] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid: Specify input:null as default for dataviewlocal - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:51:43] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: he's pretty much right though... If you build it, they will come :)
[06:52:25] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: worst case scenario, there is a nice plugin for your company to use that also gets some testing out of some other people
[06:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> WalterTamboer: it's the same way you get something into jQuery core, prove that people need it
[06:53:12] <WalterTamboer> Well, I'm asking if I can write a proposal so I can contribute to the community (everybody will benefit from it) and the reply sounds like: we don't need your stuff. While the only thing I would like to do is contribute an idea...
[06:53:30] <scott_gonzalez> but the truth is that we don't need it
[06:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> and so we won't allow it in master
[06:53:39] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to grid: http://git.io/dVDhUw
[06:53:39] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid: Use fill as heightStyle to keep pager in place when paging to last page - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> which means we won't release it
[06:53:49] <WalterTamboer> How can you say that if you haven't even heard my idea?
[06:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> I did, you want a dockable dialog
[06:54:17] <timmywil> gnarf: brilliant, that did it. thanks man
[06:54:18] <WalterTamboer> But you don't know the specifics of it. Maybe it will rock your world! ;)
[06:54:43] <gnarf> You're more than welcome to make one and release it.  And you can make it on github and still be contributing to the community...
[06:56:09] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: and nothing makes a better proposal than some demos and some source
[06:57:12] <WalterTamboer> hmm. That's a new approach for me. I'm more used to the Zend Framework style of contributing.
[06:57:24] <WalterTamboer> but ok.
[06:57:31] <WalterTamboer> gnarf: thanks for the info
[06:57:59] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: we are building a library
[06:58:04] <gnarf> you are extending it
[06:58:11] <gnarf> you're free to share your extension
[06:58:11] <gnarf> :)
[06:58:56] <WalterTamboer> well actually, I think it should be part of the library
[06:59:01] <WalterTamboer> like the position widget
[06:59:08] <WalterTamboer> that is why i want to write a proposal
[07:00:54] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: Of course you think it should be in the library
[07:00:57] <gnarf> but your like one dude
[07:00:59] <gnarf> :)
[07:03:16] <gnarf> and the dude who actually needs to do this...
[07:03:35] <gnarf> so i claim you're biased :)
[07:04:22] <WalterTamboer> To be honest with you. I don't like the way you think. You act like I am some kind of teenager hobby-scripter that just needs to have a script that does the job.
[07:04:30] <gnarf> Its really outside the scope of UI Core though...
[07:04:47] <WalterTamboer> I have more than 10 years of experience and believe me when I tell you that I understand what library programming means.
[07:05:22] <WalterTamboer> The fact that you don't even want to hear the ideas that I and apparently other people have is disturbing in a way.
[07:05:59] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: I'm listening... but you seem to be trolling at this point... I was even providing you with some methods of actually getting points across...
[07:06:11] <WalterTamboer> Sorry, I don't mean it like that.
[07:06:24] <rworth> gnarf: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138092/Timepicker#comment1319810768 what you think?
[07:07:09] <gnarf> rworth: i could mock one up pretty quick prolly
[07:07:26] <rworth> that would be awse
[07:07:36] <gnarf> rworth: i basically built one in the mask demos
[07:07:39] <gnarf> did you see that yet?
[07:07:59] <WalterTamboer> gnarf: I might be a bit frustrating right now so sorry for that. I just think that the idea that we are having is worth something and I badly want to be heard ;-)
[07:08:10] <WalterTamboer> I'll do as you say and write a demo.
[07:08:18] <gnarf> WalterTamboer: develop it, post a blog about it, put up a fiddle
[07:08:31] <gnarf> ask for people to say "hey thats cool - make it a plugin"
[07:08:54] <WalterTamboer> Thanks for the information and 99% chance that we'll get back to this in a while ;)
[07:09:03] <gnarf> rworth: http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/demos/mask/functiondefinition.html - jsut need to drop in the spinner part
[07:14:40] <kborchers> so i was thinking more about interaction last night and the handling of multiple touch events
[07:14:52] <kborchers> are we sure that is something we don't want to handle at all or if it is, maybe it's better handled in the widget which would keep track of multiple interaction points?
[07:15:00] <kborchers> or is that just not something we want to deal with
[07:15:07] <kborchers> i could see it being useful in resizable
[07:15:21] <kborchers> or maybe moving two slider handles at the same time or something
[07:15:23] <kborchers> thoughts?
[07:18:26] <gnarf> kborchers: well if each handle was its own interactions
[07:18:39] <gnarf> it would actually handle two drags at once
[07:18:42] <gnarf> i would think
[07:18:54] <gnarf> but each thing only cares about the first thing to start handling it
[07:19:19] <kborchers> yeah, that's what i meant ... so handle it at the widget level ... not in interaction itself then
[07:20:15] <kborchers> but what about resize with pinch ... or is that too specific to change interaction for just that?
[07:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> I think in that case resizable could listen for a pinch event on the element
[07:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> in addition to listening to interaction events on the handles
[07:50:56] <kborchers> maybe this is just my mobile noobness but pinch is it's own event? it's not two touches ... or you mean listen for two simultaneous touches?
[07:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> pinch is a gesture, which needs high level logic
[07:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> you would build a pinch event by listening for multiple touches
[07:51:49] <kborchers> gotcha, that makes sense
[07:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> same for swipe
[07:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> you'd listen for a touch event that moves in a mostly straight line
[07:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> and start firing swipe events
[07:52:14] <kborchers> what about long press or are we not concerned with that?
[07:52:22] <kborchers> haven't really seen anything web related for that
[07:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> that's tap and hold
[07:52:28] <kborchers> mostly just os stuff
[07:52:32] <kborchers> right
[07:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> it's used for popups
[07:52:55] <scott_gonzalez> rworth actually had a desktop example
[07:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> can't remember what it was
[07:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> oh, the back button in browsers
[07:53:22] <kborchers> right right
[07:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> tap and hold = history popup
[07:53:54] <kborchers> that would be cool if jqm had that on their back button
[07:55:49] <kborchers> ok, so i'm thinking higher level than interaction. i get it now
[07:56:30] <kborchers> interested to see / get involved with the interaction rewrites on top of "interaction" instead of mouse
[08:05:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: jenkins seems locked up?
[08:27:22] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, wanna take a look?
[08:27:39] <jzaefferer> I'd try and restart it, but I have no idea how to figure out what's causing the lockup
[08:31:57] <gnarf> ummm
[08:32:00] <gnarf> Starting Jenkins initial fork failed: Cannot allocate memory
[08:32:01] <gnarf>                                                            [FAILED]
[08:32:11] <jzaefferer> well, that's something
[08:32:26] <gnarf> theres like a gig of ram free
[08:32:35] <jzaefferer> uhu
[08:32:49] <jzaefferer> jenkins needs MOAR
[08:36:28] <gnarf> really?
[08:37:04] <gnarf> thats so much fuckin ram
[08:37:09] <gnarf> freed some more up
[08:37:12] <gnarf> seems ok now
[08:41:03] <jzaefferer> actually I was just kidding :(
[08:41:15] <jzaefferer> but apparently not
[08:41:38] <jzaefferer> but yeah, the JVM is hungry
[08:41:40] <gnarf> it definately consumes like a gig
[08:41:47] <gnarf> that is insane
[08:42:21] <jzaefferer> easiest way around the garbage collector slowing down everything to a grind is giving the jvm more heap space
[08:42:57] <jzaefferer> proper way would be to fix Jenkins leak less mem, but most java devs really suck at that, as they just work under the assumption that the garbage collector takes care of that
[08:43:16] <jzaefferer> myself included...
[08:50:31] <eddiemonge> what kind of stuff should be happening with the CSS files?
[08:51:03] <eddiemonge> jzaefferer: figured i would move my questions in here
[08:51:39] <jzaefferer> eddiemonge: good call, scott_gonzalez may also have input on the CSS framework migration
[08:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> what's going on?
[08:52:09] <jzaefferer> sounds like you're not familiar with the CSS framework currently in UI?
[08:52:25] <eddiemonge> i honestly havent looked at UI in awhile
[08:52:31] <jzaefferer> I brought up css framework migration to what jQuery Mobile is using in #jquerymobile-dev, eddiemonge seems interested in that
[08:52:38] <jzaefferer> or rather, is interested :-)
[08:53:20] <eddiemonge> i like "seems" better for now lol
[08:53:32] <eddiemonge> but im curious what jqui needs help with
[08:55:09] <scott_gonzalez> unkonwn
[08:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> we need a prototype of UI running on a mobile theme first
[08:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> turns out to be a pain because mobile uses our class names with different styles
[08:55:55] <gnarf> fuckers
[08:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, not really sure why that was done
[08:56:27] <gnarf> ?slap mobile team
[08:56:27] * bot-t slaps mobile team around a bit with a large trout
[08:56:56] <eddiemonge> are the class names at least for the same purposes?
[08:57:18] <eddiemonge> wasnt mobile going to get rolled back into ui at some point? or that was a plan anyway
[08:57:21] <scott_gonzalez> I would assume so
[08:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> they did things like changing the size of icons
[08:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> so you can't load a UI theme and a mobile theme at the same time
[08:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> no comment
[08:58:29] <eddiemonge> well wouldnt a ui theme be not optimized for mobile devices anyway so the jqm style should take precedence
[08:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> mobile shouldn't really be killing our styles
[08:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> it's going to make any kind of merging extremely difficult
[08:59:47] <eddiemonge> effin ui ;)
[09:01:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: what about replacing one theme with the other, instead of trying to load both?
[09:01:51] <jzaefferer> is that also problematic?
[09:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't try, I had no intention of ditching UI themes in 1.9
[09:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> that would likely cause a riot
[09:03:14] <gnarf> um
[09:03:30] <gnarf> i think a larger riot will eventually form if they are totally incompatible
[09:04:07] <jzaefferer> just wondering what happens if you load a mobile theme instead of a UI theme
[09:04:33] <jzaefferer> if you use UI already, keep the existing theme
[09:04:43] <jzaefferer> if you start from scratch, you'd have a choice
[09:04:58] <jzaefferer> between one or the other, not mixing
[09:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> umm....
[09:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> you need UI functional CSS files regardless
[09:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> and you're not going to get them form the mobile themeroller
[09:06:52] <eddiemonge> unless it was expanded to do both
[09:07:05] <eddiemonge> and maybe use media queries or something to decide which styles to deliver
[09:09:47] <jzaefferer> so we need a least a prototype that mixes mobile theme files with UI functional files, right?
[09:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> I guess, that's not really what I want though
[09:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> I want UI themes with bar styles
[09:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> the mobile team should be able to describe what the other differences are
[09:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> because that's the only thing people are asking for
[09:11:47] <eddiemonge> itd be interesting to see all the styles from both lined up to see what the overlap/differences are
[09:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> mobile themes even break our functional css
[09:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> at a minimum they style .ui-dialog
[09:13:55] <gnarf> i'm out til later...
[09:14:28] <gnarf> but this sounds like a blocker bug in mobile to me ;)
[09:14:57] <eddiemonge> like i said though, would you want the jqui dialog styled the same on desktop and mobile?
[09:15:10] <Wilto> Like so many horror stories: say “jQuery Mobile” three times and I appear.
[09:15:17] <Wilto> Hi guys.
[09:16:12] <jzaefferer> hey Wilto
[09:16:17] <jzaefferer> wanna fix CSS frameworks?
[09:16:27] <eddiemonge> and everything else?
[09:16:36] <Wilto> DO I!
[09:16:51] <jzaefferer> cold fusion plz kthxbai
[09:16:53] <Wilto> But yeah, what’s the deal?
[09:17:47] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez, could you summarize the issue once more?
[09:18:08] <eddiemonge> jqui doesnt want to share its styles
[09:18:11] <Wilto> Sorry—tuning in late, I know.
[09:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> we need to get jQuery UI to work with the bar styles form mobile
[09:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> but you can't mix UI and mobile themes because mobile uses our class names with different styles
[09:19:18] <Wilto> As it is with many rappers, eddiemonge.
[09:19:32] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: Ah, gotcha.
[09:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> if you guys happen to know of all the differences and why they exist, that would be really useful
[09:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> but even then, we'd have problems having both themes on a page because of stuff like .ui-dialog
[09:20:55] <Wilto> Not offhand, but it’s certainly something we could put together.
[09:21:15] <gnarf> i still think any potential clash here is bad for one of our libraries
[09:21:58] <Wilto> Which—I don’t think I have to tell you guys—will surely end in a “Sharks vs. Jets”-style dance-off.
[09:22:38] <gnarf> or just a bunch of people making fun of us cuz we can't share themes :)
[09:22:51] <Wilto> Someone has probably mentioned this, but we’re kind of flat-out for the next couple of weeks prepping for 1.0, is all.
[09:23:04] <Wilto> gnarf: That too.
[09:24:06] <scott_gonzalez> well, we're months away from 1.9
[09:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> so that's ok
[09:24:59] <gnarf> Wilto: I'm aware of that, one of the reasons that I am being assertive with the opinion that clashing css is not going to be pretty for either of us - wish this woulda been brought to my attention before you guys hit RC cycle :)
[09:25:02] <eddiemonge> how far away from 2.0?
[09:25:43] <Wilto> gnarf: I’m definitely with you there, man.
[09:33:52] <jzaefferer> this is a nice view: https://github.com/organizations/jquery/dashboard/issues
[09:35:04] <Wilto> jzaefferer: The number, you mean?
[09:35:30] <jzaefferer> no, just the aggregate view
[09:35:42] <jzaefferer> doesn't cover core and UI as those track issues elsewhere, but still
[09:42:03] <scott_gonzalez> eddiemonge: many many months away from 2.0
[10:19:47] <toddmparker_> hey guys, i just lost my irc history but i hear you were chatting at about themeroller and such
[12:07:16] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Hello! toddmparker_ is helping me to fix that width issue... It's almost there (actually, it's fixed, but Im working with him to come up with a better solution...  In the meanwhile, I just realized some future problems...
[12:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> this guy is really getting on my nerves http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7822#comment:9
[12:09:22] <rxaviers> Right now, we have a nice good looking editable widget for text. But, looking forward how other editors like spinner, select, or textarea will look.. :(... The way we styled editable buttons is working  very nice for input. But, what about those others? do you see?
[12:10:43] <toddmparker_> rxaviers: we have example of all those except spinner in mobile already
[12:13:47] <rxaviers> toddmparker_, will show you in pvt what I mean
[12:13:48] <rxaviers> brb
[12:17:06] <toddmparker_> rxaviers: are you on the ui team of just trying to get answers to a support question?
[12:23:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wow! between that guy and Walter, you've been "wrong" all day :P
[12:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> seriously
[12:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> this guy clearly doesn't understand how base URIs work
[12:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> also, wtf is up with creating a gist instead of a fiddle?
[12:24:16] <kborchers> or just doesn't want to admit he's wrong at this point
[12:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> what a pain, I had to download it, unzip it, then run it through Apache
[12:24:55] <Wilto> Hey uh, rxaviers: Just like earlier in #jquerymobile-dev, this is a channel for the development team. For general support, you’ll want #jquery.
[12:25:04] <kborchers> because the fiddle would more quickly show he was wrong
[12:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers is developing
[12:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: haha
[12:25:22] <Wilto> Ah, my bad! Sorry about that.
[12:25:59] <toddmparker_> sorry, just checking
[12:26:11] <kborchers> rxaviers is working on what is it?
[12:26:12] <toddmparker_> i had another guy stalking me today, put me on edge
[12:26:15] <kborchers> oh editable right?
[12:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_: I'm on edge today too
[12:26:35] <toddmparker_> i can see that
[12:26:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting berated by users
[12:26:54] <toddmparker_> you deserve it, i don't
[12:27:07] <Wilto> I forsee a #jquery-dev-venting channel in the near future.
[12:27:14] <Wilto> Just set up some bots and yell at them all day.
[12:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on one small thing for most of the day :-/
[12:28:24] <scott_gonzalez> time to get back to that...
[12:33:26] <rxaviers> Wilto, toddmparker_, sorry guys, I had to leave. But, I'm back. I understand your worry, I would do the same. :)...
[12:33:39] <toddmparker_> heh
[12:33:51] <toddmparker_> so those editable doodads look good
[12:34:00] <rxaviers> Wilto, toddmparker_, kborchers, I'm developing editable (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/editable)
[12:34:14] <rxaviers> toddmparker_, nice :)
[12:41:49] <Wilto> Hey, badass stuff, rxaviers. Now I feel even more like I owe you an apology beer.
[12:42:23] <rxaviers> Wilto, lol, dont worry, no big deal. dont need to
[12:43:07] <rxaviers> Wilto, but, I accept the beer if sometime we meet
[12:43:19] <Wilto> Now we’re talkin’.
[12:43:24] <rxaviers> :)
[12:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> can someone do a quick sanity check on this: https://gist.github.com/f92ff1ea1f5f6b4498fb
[12:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> it all seems to be working
[12:56:01] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, Jörn, if you have some time and want to see how that issue has been fixed, feel free to check that https://github.com/rxaviers/jquery-ui/tree/editable_tmp. I'll make some more tests and make a better commit comment before pushing that.
[12:57:11] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, we need that fix for input / textarea and select. We may not needed it if the editor is spinner or other block element.

[13:00:15] <jq-jenkins> Scott González: Tests: Added ability to run tests against minified files via ?min=1
[13:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, this guy won't stop
[13:07:01] <kborchers> still? refreshing
[13:09:39] <kborchers> wow
[13:10:04] <kborchers> FIX IT NOW ... YOU ARE BORKED ... NOT ME
[13:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> I swear he must not have done what I said about removing tabs and seeing that the anchor doesn't go to where he thinks it does
[13:10:45] <kborchers> why would he ... then he would have to stop arguing
[13:11:46] <kborchers> plus that would require rationally thinking about the situation and trying to solve it rather than believing he is correct and you are wrong and you need to fix it
[13:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> who's good with SQL?
[13:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> I've apparently forgotten how to do joins properly :-P
[13:33:46] <kborchers> whatcha joinin'?
[13:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/1323472
[13:35:08] <scott_gonzalez> I want that to include components that have 0 bug tickets
[13:37:22] <kborchers> ok, so what are the two tables?
[13:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> well, the ticket table is the only table
[13:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> so it'll have to join on itself
[13:40:23] <kborchers> oh ... ok let's see
[13:40:57] <kborchers> you could do something like
[13:44:20] <kborchers> hmmm, maybe you could just union two queries
[13:44:39] <kborchers> the one in the gist gets you components and their number of bug tickets right?
[13:45:06] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:45:39] <kborchers> then you could union that with select distinct(component), 0 as `count` from ticket where component not in (select distinct(component) from tickets where status not like 'closed' and type = 'bug')
[13:45:43] <kborchers> somethign like that?
[13:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh, that might work, but doesn't seem like the best way to do it
[13:46:35] <kborchers> probably not but i know joining to itself is tricky
[13:51:04] <kborchers> i don't think a join would do it though because you have two different selection criteria. there's not really anything to join them on
[13:51:20] <kborchers> i think two queries and a union is your best bet ... could be wrong but can't think of a better way
[13:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, maybe
[14:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> the union doesn't seem to like the fact that there's grouping
[14:04:09] <kborchers> ouch, yeah ... hmmm
[14:07:45] <kborchers> i think if both queries have the same group by it will work so remove that first distinct and add group by compenent in that statement i wrote and see if that helps
[14:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: what's your trac username?
[14:10:24] <kborchers> k_borchers
[14:10:46] <kborchers> silly my used my twitter handle instead of kborchers like i do everywhere else it's available
[14:10:56] <kborchers> s/my/me
[14:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> can you get to this page? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29?action=edit
[14:12:50] <kborchers> yes
[14:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[14:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> fix it :-P
[14:13:17] <kborchers> heh ... leaving in 15 min but i'll see what i can do
[14:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> no problem it's not urgent, so if you don't get it working right now don't worry about it
[14:13:51] <kborchers> k
[14:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> and on that note, I'm heading downstairs
[14:35:33] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: well ... seems like my queries make trac angry and it locks up a lot ... i'll try some more over the weekend if you want but i gotta go
[14:36:17] <kborchers> i really think some permutation of what is there will do it ... just not quite right somewhere
[14:36:25] <kborchers> cya
[16:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Dave Ward figured it out :-)
