[19:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: re: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11795 Can you look through the effects tickets? I think there's at least one ticket related to this.
[19:27:01] <mikesherov> Oh, there's a PR I mentioned should be closed
[19:27:03] <mikesherov> but sure
[19:27:05] <mikesherov> I will
[19:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I just closed that one.
[19:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to use the UI tickets to verify the change in core.
[19:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> I also just landed your 3 test cleanup PRs.
