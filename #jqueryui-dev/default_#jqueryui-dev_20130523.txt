[05:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Let me know when you're around.
[05:39:28] <tj_vantoll> Now is good.
[05:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> So we have http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/classNames/ now
[05:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> But also http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/theming/api/
[05:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely have this content on the API site.
[05:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> So the question is do we want it in both places?
[05:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing no.
[05:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> Since it means all updates would need to be duplicated (and likely missed).
[05:41:20] <tj_vantoll> Yeah, my thought would be to axe the page from learn.
[05:41:46] <tj_vantoll> It's really API doc content, not really "learn"ing material.
[05:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> The other pages are good for learn, how to write a custom theme and how to use ThemeRoller.
[05:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to work on the .ui-front docs and add a theming directory for api.jqueryui.com
[05:42:41] <tj_vantoll> Exactly. Learn could and probably should have a page that is how you can use those classes to make cool things.
[05:42:49] <scott_gonzalez>  /classNames/ -> /theming/css-framework/
[05:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> add /theming/ui-front/
[05:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> and the icons page can be /theming/icons/
[05:43:18] <tj_vantoll> +1
[05:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so once that's done, the only thing left is http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/animate
[05:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> I just cannot come up with a good way to document this.
[05:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> I though of api.jqueryui.com/animate/ but that just seems weird.
[05:43:59] <tj_vantoll> I didn't even know that was a thing.
[05:44:27] <tj_vantoll> I think it has to be there as an override though.
[05:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> We pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color into effects core.
[05:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> So it's a bit tricky, because we don't actually override .animate().
[05:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> We just add step hooks.
[05:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.effect.js#L628-L634
[05:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf kswedberg DaveMethvin|away: Thoughts on how we should document the color animations on api.jqueryui.com?
[05:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> We could just have a color-animation page, not an entry.
[05:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> I was going down the road of writing an .animat() entry, but it seemed really wrong to be fully documenting .animate() again just to say that you can animate colors.
[05:47:09] <tj_vantoll> And put it in the effects category.
[05:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:47:17] <tj_vantoll> That's better.
[05:47:39] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: that seems reasonable to me.
[05:48:03] <kswedberg> as long as there is a clear way to get to it.
[05:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll show up in the effects and effects-core categories.
[05:48:16] <kswedberg> like it's somewhere in the nav
[05:48:19] <kswedberg> ok, cool.
[05:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll get all of that done today.
[05:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> Then UI will be fully off of MediaWiki :-)
[05:49:09] <tj_vantoll> Excellent :)
[05:49:27] <kswedberg> yay!
[05:51:15] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez Have a moment to discuss shadow DOM?
[05:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:51:50] <tj_vantoll> Chrome (stable and canary) will not let you view or replace an <input>'s shadow root: http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/uTa2d/
[05:52:32] <tj_vantoll> But per the spec I don't see any reason you shouldn't be able to do thatâ€¦ so I'm not sure whether this is an implementation issue or not.
[05:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's hop into #whatwg later and ask.
[05:53:08] <tj_vantoll> Sounds good.
[05:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably too early to get useful comments in there.
[05:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> Since a lot of spec writers and implementors are west coast.
[05:54:35] <tj_vantoll> Ok, I should be free from like 1pm to 4pm.
[05:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we've got a content meeting at 1pm, but those usually don't happen :-P
[05:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> So let's plan for 1:00 or 1:30.
[05:56:46] <tj_vantoll> Ok sounds good.
[05:57:42] <tj_vantoll> Meh, looks like I have an appointment. So probably more like 1:30 âˆ’ 2:00. I'll ping you around then.
[06:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/142
[07:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, at BarCampRDU when we were talking about history, we said that in `git push -f` the f stands for failure :-P
[07:52:00] <tj_vantoll> Huh, didn't realize that markdown was supported.
[07:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yup :-)
[07:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> Just can't write markdown inside XML.
[07:53:02] <tj_vantoll> Makes sense.
[07:53:04] <tj_vantoll> "shoudl"
[07:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> I see no such typo :-P
[07:54:18] <tj_vantoll> "This page is out of date. Refresh to see the latest." :)
[07:54:55] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess force pushing on PRs isn't a great idea.
[07:55:17] <tj_vantoll> +* The stacking element being appended must have the `ui-front` class and must
[07:55:17] <tj_vantoll> +also have `position` set. Using [/position/](.position()) will automatically set
[07:55:17] <tj_vantoll> +`position`.
[07:55:37] <tj_vantoll> By setting position do you mean setting position to relative|absolute|fixed?
[07:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:57:52] <tj_vantoll> Might want to convert the "Note" about relative|absolute|fixed into a bullet.
[07:57:52] <tj_vantoll> "and must
[07:57:52] <tj_vantoll> +also have `position` set. Using [/position/](.position()) will automatically set
[07:57:52] <tj_vantoll> +`position`."
[07:57:53] <tj_vantoll> to
[07:57:54] <tj_vantoll> "The stacking element must also have its position ste to relative, absolute, or fixed in order for the z-index to be applied. Using positionâ€¦"
[07:57:55] <tj_vantoll> Just a suggestion. This looks good.
[07:59:01] <tj_vantoll> Also maybe add a link from here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/pages/theming/css-framework.html#L26
[08:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: All addressed.
[08:05:30] <tj_vantoll> z-index is <code></code>'d in some places and not in others.
[08:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Is the existing reference to autocomplete enough?
[08:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[08:07:45] <tj_vantoll> kk I'm set. I agree with jzaefferer that an example would go a long ways, but I understand why you'd want to wait on that.
[08:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, nobody noticed the backward markdown link.
[08:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/95717b7f99dd70126f852e45548eed09e570d53a
[08:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's the one thing I prefer from Trac's syntax.
[08:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> [url text] is so much nicer than [text](url)
[08:14:47] <tj_vantoll> I'm fine with either. I like consistency. My brain has too many little syntax / formatting nuances to keep track of.
[08:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> GAH. I HATE HATE HATE pull requests showing up as issues.
[08:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> My commit now references my PR and not the original issue.
[08:17:38] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I hate that too. A pull request is not necessarily an issue.
[10:39:52] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez fyi I'm around now. Read your animate page, looks good.
[10:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> Just added a demo as well.
[10:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's go poke some people in #whatwg.
[11:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Another thing you might not be aware of: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/commit/7f44fd20bb77fa9f3d7902327d9856548eb14d19#L0R45
[11:20:20] <tj_vantoll> Huh. So what exactly is happening there?
[11:21:11] <tj_vantoll> Oh I see.
[11:22:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> It's like the XML includes.
[11:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> But cooler.
