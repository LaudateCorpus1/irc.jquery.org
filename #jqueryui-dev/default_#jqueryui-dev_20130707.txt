[03:00:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I having IRC troubles. Saw you were looking for me. If I am not here you can reach me via hangout.
[03:00:30] <uGoMobi> I am*
[07:00:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you are you around?
[07:01:01] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[07:01:23] <arschmitz> hey ok had some stuff i wanted to run by you
[07:01:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[07:02:18] <arschmitz> with textinput does an input need a wrap if it does not have a clear button?
[07:02:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not anymore
[07:02:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I did that for 2 reasons
[07:03:13] <uGoMobi> IE7, because box-sizing border-box doesn't work there
[07:03:27] <uGoMobi> second reason was consistency
[07:03:45] <uGoMobi> IE7 is not an issue anymore (c-grade)
[07:04:20] <arschmitz> ok because my thought was that for inputs without clearbutton we could do something like button markup is now where it just adds class
[07:04:21] <uGoMobi> leaves us with consistency
[07:04:32] <arschmitz> and avoid the overhead of a widget
[07:04:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: for performance that would be best of course
[07:05:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am just not sure how confusing this is going to be
[07:05:34] <arschmitz> yeah button is confusing and this would be same
[07:06:22] <uGoMobi> we would also need to duplicate the CSS
[07:06:40] <uGoMobi> one with styles for the div wrapper and other with style for the input
[07:07:18] <arschmitz> yeah im just wondering if the performance gain is worth it
[07:07:38] <uGoMobi> that means we need to do something like .ui-input-has-clear input to unset styles for the input if there is a clr btn + wrapper
[07:08:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe I am more in favor to show (demo) how to just apply style to the input and don't use any JS
[07:08:59] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:09:11] <uGoMobi> and leave the widget as it is
[07:09:29] <arschmitz> and just make them always add data-role="none"?
[07:10:16] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:10:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and we have the enhance option
[07:11:08] <uGoMobi> so you can just add the div wrapper in your markup with that class
[07:11:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the other option is in the widget switch to only wrap if clearbutton is true
[07:13:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but it would still be a widget?
[07:13:15] <arschmitz> yes
[07:14:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not real sure though because enhanced would still be better
[07:14:23] <arschmitz> and it would make enhanced confusing
[07:14:43] <arschmitz> and would make setOptions more complicated
[07:14:59] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:15:49] <arschmitz> ok i think just leaving the way it is is best
[07:15:59] <arschmitz> next question https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/textinput/js/widgets/forms/textinput.js#L82 
[07:16:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[07:16:07] <arschmitz> i kinda think we can remove this now
[07:16:14] <arschmitz> it only effects ios4
[07:16:34] <arschmitz> and all ios < 5 is under 1% now
[07:16:45] <uGoMobi> getting rid of the dependency on support
[07:16:47] <arschmitz> and it makes textinput depend on support tests
[07:16:51] <arschmitz> exactly
[07:17:44] <uGoMobi> did we ever test if this was fixed in a iOS4.x release?
[07:18:18] <arschmitz> no idea but since the note was after ios5 had come out and i dont think there were any 4.x updates after 5
[07:18:24] <arschmitz> its very unlikely
[07:18:36] <uGoMobi> checking the apple bug reporter now
[07:19:02] <arschmitz> i need to register for that im not right now
[07:20:35] <uGoMobi> I searched with that bug ID from the comment but nothing found :
[07:20:37] <uGoMobi> :/
[07:22:49] <arschmitz> ok so what do you think remove and if too many people complain we can put it back?
[07:23:16] <uGoMobi> nevermind... I can only search in bugs I reported myself
[07:24:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it should not depend on if people complain... if we make a decision about this we have to stick to it
[07:25:06] <uGoMobi> but I want to get rid of it too
[07:25:20] <arschmitz> yeah such a small % for a big dependency 
[07:25:54] <arschmitz> because support has 4 dependencies
[07:28:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am thinking about how we should handle this kind of things in general
[07:29:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i also looked into not wrapping panel 
[07:29:24] <arschmitz> not wrapping page contents with panels inside a page that is
[07:29:35] <arschmitz> its easy to do with push and overlay
[07:29:45] <arschmitz> but as far as i can tell its not possible with reveal
[07:30:13] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's indeed problematic
[07:30:32] <uGoMobi> or at least difficult
[07:30:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a bug in webkit that makes transform + fixed not possible
[07:30:48] <uGoMobi> looking into panels now
[07:31:31] <arschmitz> i could make reveal work in firefox 
[07:36:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you test on browserstack if that autocorrect issue still occurs on iOS4 if you remove the fix?
[07:37:04] <arschmitz> yeah dont see why not
[09:33:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: panels outside page doesn't seem to work
[09:33:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the panel gets page classes
[09:33:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is after I merged master in ext-panels
[09:40:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm ill check it out
[09:42:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its something from merging master
[09:43:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe changes in page for new toolbar widget
[09:43:16] <arschmitz> maybe ill have to look
[09:44:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just finished mowing the lawn im going to get some lunch and then ill check it out
[09:45:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome, thanks!
[09:49:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I reverted the merge of master and still see the same problem
[09:50:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: here is my test page http://jsbin.com/esekic/2/edit (you have to point it to your local jqm folder)
[09:53:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why dont you use the docs page?
[09:54:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because there the panel markup is inside the page
[09:55:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://view.jquerymobile.com/ext-panels/demos/widgets/panels/external.php
[09:55:42] <arschmitz> i dont see page classes on the panels there and those are external
[09:55:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: aha, thanks
[09:55:56] <uGoMobi> that page wasn't in the menu
[09:56:07] <arschmitz> oh i probably forgot to add it my bad
[09:56:32] <arschmitz> i have a ton of docs work to do but figured that can be done post alpha and dev cant so been concentrating on dev
[09:56:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but there the panel is also inside the page
[09:56:48] <arschmitz> no the panels there are extenal
[09:57:14] <arschmitz> not the nav panels but the example ones
[09:59:06] <arschmitz> the six example ones at top are after the page inside the body
[09:59:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry I see it now
[09:59:26] <arschmitz> you should also see the css problem i mentioned
[09:59:59] <arschmitz> on reveal and push
[10:00:06] <uGoMobi> i see a bit margin between panel and page
[10:00:10] <uGoMobi> that what you mean?
[10:00:12] <arschmitz> yea
[10:00:23] <uGoMobi> okay, will give that a look
[10:00:38] <arschmitz> i have not even attemted to fix it so it might be something really simple
[10:00:39] <uGoMobi> now i have to find out why this page works but the JS Bin  doesn't
[10:00:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill look at it my best guess is maybe source order
[10:00:58] <uGoMobi> yeah no problem
[10:01:02] <arschmitz> yours was before mine is after
[10:01:13] <arschmitz> should not matter but you never know
[10:01:14] <uGoMobi> I tested with panel before and after the page
[10:01:28] <arschmitz> weird because your markup looked good
[10:01:53] <arschmitz> anyway like i said ill look in a bit
[10:09:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: found it
[10:10:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when autoside page I have to call panel()
[10:11:36] <arschmitz> yup
[10:11:43] <arschmitz> no autoinit for things outside pages
[10:11:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, forgot about that
[10:13:18] <arschmitz> it happens 
[11:38:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still here
[12:06:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am here noow
[13:39:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping! Still there, by any chance?
[14:10:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: am now
[14:15:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  I guess we all got that Kodiak for iPad email
[14:25:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we need to merege johnbenders content widget branch
[14:25:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[14:25:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you know what still needs to be done, if any?
[14:25:56] <uGoMobi> how about unit tests?
[14:26:07] <arschmitz> its good to go as is
[14:26:27] <uGoMobi> that's great
[14:26:31] <arschmitz> there is more to do but its mostlt organization
[14:27:01] <arschmitz> nothing that will be done prior to 1.4 at this point
[14:27:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:27:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: want to check with johnbender tomorrow ?
[14:27:35] <arschmitz> but i think we should merge so we can be on the lookout for issues
[14:27:38] <arschmitz> sure
[14:27:49] <uGoMobi> yes, I agree
[14:28:13] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we have all branches merged for couple of days before releasing alpha
[14:28:30] <arschmitz> im pretty sure he is done and was leaving to _|Nix|_ or i to merge he even asked gseguin if it was done yet other day
[14:28:47] <uGoMobi> oh ok, didn't know that
[14:28:59] <uGoMobi> then let's merge
[14:29:06] <arschmitz> no commits in over a month
[14:30:15] <arschmitz> ill do it in a few minutes
[14:30:20] <uGoMobi> cool
[15:19:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sorry ... got engroced in collapsible.
[15:19:48] <arschmitz> thats fine
[15:19:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Reviewing that now.
[15:19:58] <arschmitz> awesome
[15:20:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We really need to reduce the options ...
[15:20:09] <arschmitz> im mergering content-widget
[15:20:23] <arschmitz> we can depreciate some what do you want to get rid of?
[15:20:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like heading: "h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,legend"?
[15:20:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't wanna get rid of it. I wanna move it to $.mobile.collapsible.defaults.heading
[15:21:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... since it only affects construction. If you change it after construction, it's useless.
[15:21:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah other side though is that it is a per instance thing not same for all
[15:22:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I suppose you could say .collapsible({ heading: ".mySpecialHeading" });
[15:22:54] <arschmitz> yeah or event data-heading=".myspecialHeading"
[15:23:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... I guess it can stay, but there's really no point in treating it during _setOptions ...
[15:24:01] <arschmitz> no just skip i think in setOptions
[15:24:14] <arschmitz> its just like enhanced its a valid option but does nothing to change it
[15:24:29] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, true ...
[15:25:11] <_|Nix|_> Weren't we merging content widget after 1.4.0?
[15:25:19] <_|Nix|_> ... on a different note ...
[15:25:56] <arschmitz> no john was just leaving it to us
[15:26:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... OK ... 
[15:27:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: he was even asking the other day if we had done it yet
[15:28:22] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I saw something there, but I wasn't sure what it was. I was just skimming.
[15:28:47] <arschmitz> yeah theres a few conflicts im sorting out right now
[15:28:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[15:29:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're just smokin' these days ... wow!
[15:29:20] <arschmitz> only real ones are in navigation 
[15:29:22] <arschmitz> trying
[15:29:23] <arschmitz> :)
[15:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Did he end up modularizing out the click handler? Separating that out into its own AMD-module was one of the goals.
[15:30:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The whole _registerInternalEvents is waaaay too monolithic.
[15:30:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think so 
[15:30:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no commits since before portland
[15:31:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, so that's one thing we may want to look into - post-1.4.0 though, unless it totally makes sense to do it sooner than that.
[15:31:20] <arschmitz> no i think just get it merged for 1.4
[15:31:29] <arschmitz> then look into further dev on it post 1.4
[15:31:34] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[15:31:41] <arschmitz> i just dont think either of us will have the time in the next week
[15:31:49] <_|Nix|_> Nope :(
[15:32:25] <arschmitz> im even leaving all my docs changes till after next week since those can happen post alpha
[15:32:44] <arschmitz> just trying to pound out widget reviews and branch merges and stuff
[15:32:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure ...
[15:33:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, it's crazy ... especially with _destroy() and options.enhanced ...
[15:33:39] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:34:05] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[15:34:16] <arschmitz> id like to get the NS change in if possible too that way we can depreciate the namespace 
[15:34:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm just realizing that for collapsible I might have to keep the heading around. It gets remove()d if it's a legend. However, if you then _destroy(), you need to keep it around so you can put it back!
[15:34:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[15:37:03] <uGoMobi> I am gonna change milestone for navbar tickets to 1.5
[15:37:37] <_|Nix|_> ... and I'm going to bed ... L8R all!
[15:37:47] <uGoMobi> any other widgets that we haven't looked at yet, but do need attention?
[15:37:55] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_ !
[15:38:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: navbar was one im "hoping" to get to but who knows
[15:38:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: table widget? can we keep the temp solution and move refactor to 1.5?
[15:38:40] <arschmitz> yeah table needs way too much work
[15:38:45] <arschmitz> thats not gonna happen
[15:38:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:39:09] <uGoMobi> I think there are one or two PR's for 1.3 issues
[15:39:35] <uGoMobi> frequent did some work there
[15:39:43] <uGoMobi> I will give it a look
[15:40:11] <arschmitz> ok i know he had worked on both versions but got confused as to the status on both
[15:40:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh we cant use 1.3 solution
[15:41:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: reflow and column toggle are extensions now
[15:41:13] <arschmitz> but still dont have refresh
[15:41:14] <uGoMobi> ah that's on master
[15:41:25] <uGoMobi> solution for refresh only in the 1.3-stable branch
[15:41:30] <uGoMobi> :(
[15:41:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we should check with frequent
[15:41:50] <arschmitz> i thought he finished 1.4 versions 
[15:41:51] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:42:36] <arschmitz> if they are close at all i can fix them up
[15:42:44] <arschmitz> because that is important
[15:43:21] <uGoMobi> let's see if he is here on IRC tomorrow, otherwise send him an email
[15:43:31] <arschmitz> sounds good
