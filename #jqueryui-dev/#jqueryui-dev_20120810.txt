[02:14:52] <marianoguerra> hi! I found a bug on jquery and jqueryui (1.8.0 and 1.8.22 respectively) the bug happens when using jq 1.8.0 but not  when using 1.7.2
[02:15:02] <marianoguerra> here is the gist
[02:15:04] <marianoguerra> https://gist.github.com/3312762#file_with_jq_172.html
[02:15:28] <marianoguerra> at the top the readme explains how to reproduce it
[02:15:34] <marianoguerra> will try to create a jsfiddle now
[02:18:48] <marianoguerra> here is a jsfiddle with 1.7.2 (sorry about the lack of css it doesn't seem to load) http://jsfiddle.net/bAPjS/1/
[02:19:16] <marianoguerra> here is with 1.8.0 http://jsfiddle.net/CtDHC/
[02:31:49] <marianoguerra> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8485
[03:05:32] <marianoguerra> I think I found the fix, can someone check the diff attached to the issue? (the bug exists in the branch 1-8-stable but it's fixed on master so I did the fix on 1-8-stable)
