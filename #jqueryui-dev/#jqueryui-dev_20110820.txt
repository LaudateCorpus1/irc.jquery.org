[04:52:03] <formers> hi, is there an eta for 1.9 ?
[05:26:54] <jzaefferer> formers: this year
[05:27:34] <formers> awesome, has the scope been fixed for the release ?
[05:31:22] <jzaefferer> see http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Roadmap
[05:32:33] <jzaefferer> we're also working on the Grid, which is intended to land in 2.1, which may hamper 1.9 development - on the other hand, we actually got funding for the grid and are spending a good amount of time on 1.9 dev as part of grid
[05:33:51] <formers> sounds silly,  but I'm waiting for 1.9 for the spinner control

[06:00:15] <jquicommit> [jquery-ui/grid] Grid SPF: Sync filters with location.hash to share interesting results easily - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:30:09] <jzaefferer> share filtering results with others, e.g. http://view.jqueryui.com/grid/grid-spf/menugrid.html#%7B%22AverageRating%22%3A%7B%22operator%22%3A%22%3C%3D%22%2C%22value%22%3A1%7D%7D
[06:30:25] <jzaefferer> url-encoding JSON isn't great, but quite easy to implement :-)
