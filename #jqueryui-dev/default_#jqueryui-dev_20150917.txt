[05:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz_: Yeah, let's add it.
[05:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, did we switch to singleton overlays?
[05:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we didn't. So we should add the overlay to the classes option.

[05:33:53] <jzaefferer> arschmitz_ scott_gonzalez: We've got lots of failures when running against jQuery Core compat-git: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1297
[05:34:08] <jzaefferer> regular build is now working fine again: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1296 (just one draggable/chrome fluke, whatever)
[05:34:17] <jzaefferer> aaand its gone
[05:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[05:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> rounding errors
[05:36:43] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI - compat-git core build #970: STILL UNSTABLE in 6 min 7 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%20compat-git%20core/970/
[05:38:59] <jzaefferer> dialog failures look like "rounding" errors. Datepicker and Effects look more like issues with show/hide
[05:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> I would actually love for our test suite to be broken because of show/hide.
[05:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe that would convince the core team that this was a bad change.
[05:42:18] <jzaefferer> I just reran a few of the singular failures, its now looking a bit more consistent. Resizable and Tabs have failures on IE10, 11 and Edge, Draggable on IE8+9, Datepicker, Dialog and Effects almost everywhere
[05:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: What are your thoughts about the `._getCreateOptions()` testing?
[05:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> Can I just land it without the tests? I don't think there's a good way to check what you want.
[05:44:40] <jzaefferer> yeah
[05:48:06] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #1598: All: Delegate to base `_getCreateOptions()`. (06master...06getcreateoptions) 02http://git.io/vZp0R
[05:55:32] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: do you have some bandwidth to track down the git-compat failures? 
[05:55:49] <jzaefferer> I spent too much time on testing button PR and fixing build
[05:56:26] <doesallmagic2> Yippee, build fixed!
[05:56:27] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery UI build #1628: FIXED in 8 min 36 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20UI/1628/
[05:56:27] <doesallmagic2> Scott Gonz√°lez: All: Delegate to base `_getCreateOptions()`.
[05:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try. Not sure how busy I'll be this morning and then I have a tattoo session this afternoon.
[06:01:45] <jzaefferer> ok
[06:01:54] <jzaefferer> Well, it has been broken for several months...
[06:02:02] <jzaefferer> At least the normal build is back up :-)
[06:02:13] <jzaefferer> minus the css file on the CDN
[06:06:09] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15scottgonzalez opened pull request #1599: Widget: Call `._setOptionDisabled()` on init if the widget is disabled (06master...06disabled-setter) 02http://git.io/vnf3h
[06:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> Were we just doing a manual concat on the CSS files before?
[06:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't be against bringing that back just to support the git build.
[06:30:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: yeah, pretty much, using the concat grunt task and a list of files to get them in the right order
[06:30:26] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: where should I report my findings about webpack support?
[06:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> Probably in the ticket.
[06:32:18] <jzaefferer> That would require a Trac login...
[06:32:29] <jzaefferer> Actually I think I can do a pull request
[06:32:54] <jzaefferer> Or I just need to do more testing
[06:33:56] <jzaefferer> it looks like webpack will fail to include anything from jquery-ui without the index.js file, but it doesn't actually need any content o_O
[06:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: The dialog failures are likely caused by https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/b60b26e18477d21fa5ec9c6572e114fc5d441730
[06:40:45] <jzaefferer> "WIDTH(), HEIGHT(), ETC. SHOULDN'T ROUND" Opened 4 years ago
[06:41:37] <jzaefferer> It's a question of whether there are a lot of popular plugins that would break with fractional widths and heights. http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9628#comment:18
[06:41:52] <jzaefferer> rather https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1724#issuecomment-59852610
[06:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Ok, I've got all the dialog tests passing now.
[06:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just changed every `parseInt()` in resizable to `parseFloat()`.
[06:48:04] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: regarding webpack, as far as I can tell, adding an index.js with a full list makes no sense. Including anything from there just causes EVERYTHING to be included, which we shouldn't support. But, as long as the "main" property in package.json points to some file, requiring "jquery-ui/ui/..." works fine and correctly includes that file with its dependencies
[06:48:39] <jzaefferer> `"main": "ui/widget.js"` is a bit silly, but works
[06:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:49:29] <jzaefferer> I'd like to have a demo that actually uses a widget on the html page, without all the cruft
[06:49:36] <jzaefferer> that will take a while to clean up
