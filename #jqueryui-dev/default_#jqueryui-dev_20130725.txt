[00:28:10] <Adok> Hi there
[00:29:14] <Adok> Question: I use a list of links in my project in a list defined by <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="false">. The problem I have is that regular and visited links are displayed in the same color. How can I make visited links be displayed in a different color? Simple CSS won't help due to jQuery Mobile.
[00:43:51] <uGoMobi> Adok: #jquery is the channel for support
[00:44:12] <Adok> For some reason I cannot join it
[00:44:25] <uGoMobi> oh :(
[00:44:49] <uGoMobi> Adok: you want to give the text in the listview buttons a different color?
[00:44:55] <uGoMobi> if :visited
[00:45:17] <Adok> Yes. How exactly is this done?
[00:45:36] <uGoMobi> Adok: jQuery Mobile 1.3.2?
[00:45:50] <Adok> 1.2.0
[00:45:54] <uGoMobi> ok
[00:49:51] <uGoMobi> Adok: http://jsbin.com/edeluh/41/edit
[00:50:34] <uGoMobi> change the "c" in ui-btn-up-c to theme that you are using
[00:50:50] <Adok> .ui-btn-up-c a.ui-link-inherit:visited { color: red; }
[00:50:50] <b-ot> Adok: Sorry, I can't find anything on a.ui-link-inherit:visited+{+color:+red;+}
[00:50:52] <Adok> Thanks!
[00:51:10] <uGoMobi> yw
[00:52:29] <Adok> It works fine. Thank you very much. That was exactly what I was looking for.
[03:10:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good morning :-)
[03:11:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning
[03:11:46] <agcolom> I had a chat with Ralph this morning. but we had to make it short as it was already midnight for him, so we'll catch up again in the morning for him. He's in Portland ;-)
[03:12:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok great
[03:13:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom:  I saw his PR
[03:17:56] <agcolom> yes, so the resources page is in. I'll update it...
[03:18:09] <agcolom> (with latest articles and other bits and pieces)
[03:18:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: awesome! great that RWhitbeck can help!
[03:19:12] <agcolom> the thing is today I'm quite busy... I'm at work now with my daughter, then we leave around 1.45 to pick up Alex from summer school, and then we go to the French Comsulate to pick up their passport!
[03:19:23] <agcolom> s/Comsulate/Consulate 
[03:19:41] <agcolom> I hope to be back for the meeting, but I may be a bit late...
[03:20:57] <agcolom> then I'll be on holiday for the whole of august, but should be ok to work a few hours everyday while at my parents' but I'm not sure yet when I'll be there... as soon as I know I'll give you the details.
[03:22:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok thanks for the update
[03:22:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we are releasing 1.4 alpha today
[03:22:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I think we will just have short meeting
[03:22:56] <uGoMobi> so no worries
[03:23:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: would be good if you, RWhitbeck and I have a meeting about the website before you go on vacation
[03:24:26] <uGoMobi> then I can work on that too in August
[03:25:08] <agcolom> sure, yes.

[05:22:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I need your help with... ext-panels (what else ;-) )
[05:22:48] <arschmitz> no problem
[05:23:30] <arschmitz> woooah im geting script errors on my iphone on master
[05:23:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: they work on initial page but they are broken on second page
[05:23:50] <uGoMobi> wot?!
[05:24:05] <arschmitz> chrome on my mac is fine
[05:24:13] <arschmitz> but my iphone its broken
[05:24:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good news about the ext-panels issue is that it's same on all browsers so I suppose I do something wrong in the JS
[05:25:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: iOS6 iPhone?
[05:25:16] <arschmitz> 10s5
[05:25:19] <arschmitz> ios5
[05:25:36] <arschmitz> lol not sure my brain is awake yet
[05:26:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I tested ext-panels on browserstack iOS5 this morning
[05:26:12] <uGoMobi> master has been merged (sorry) in that branch
[05:26:17] <arschmitz> ok i was talking about master lol
[05:26:18] <uGoMobi> didn't see a problem
[05:27:01] <arschmitz> ok its all good was a network error
[05:27:06] <arschmitz> jquery was not found
[05:27:07] <uGoMobi> ahaaa
[05:27:16] <uGoMobi> no cache?
[05:27:23] <arschmitz> cleared cache and tried again and all is good
[05:27:40] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:27:59] <arschmitz> i turn private browsing on when im testing so it loses all cache on window close
[05:28:08] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[05:28:19] <arschmitz> ok so panels is it pushed?
[05:28:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[05:28:34] <arschmitz> ok ill pull it down and take a look now
[05:28:43] <arschmitz> do you have a demo page i should look at?
[05:28:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://view.jquerymobile.com/ext-panels/demos/test/panels/
[05:30:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: steps to reproduce... on page A open left and right panel should be all fine, nav to page B or C and left panel (external) is fine but right (internal) panel won't open
[05:30:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: they are all single pages, not multipage
[05:30:55] <arschmitz> ok perfect ill look
[05:31:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks!
[05:32:13] <arschmitz> odd its the internal that does not work
[05:32:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Do you think you could give filterable a quick skim? I think it's ready to be merged.
[05:33:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sure just let me finish with this panel issue then ill take a look
[05:33:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome! Thanks!
[05:33:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll move to the table-widget-review.
[05:33:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no problem
[05:35:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: scottjehl__ : did you guys notice an issue with Grunticon on Android 2.2? Someone is saying icons don't show up. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6204#issuecomment-21543595

[05:36:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: 
[05:36:29] <arschmitz> you have an external header there
[05:36:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: scottjehl__ : Note that I removed the hasFeature() check from the SVG support test because we don't support FF 3.6
[05:36:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes,  external header and internal footer on all pages
[05:36:53] <arschmitz> and you have a single button but are trying to open 2 different panels
[05:37:01] <uGoMobi> huh?
[05:37:19] <uGoMobi> OMG
[05:37:25] <arschmitz> the right button always points to "#internal-a"
[05:37:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am such a fool
[05:37:31] <arschmitz> lol :)
[05:37:55] <uGoMobi> sorry it was a short night
[05:38:12] <arschmitz> yeah i hear ya i feel asleep at my laptop working on autoinit
[05:38:29] <uGoMobi> oh man I can imagine
[05:38:33] <_|Nix|_> Heroic, dudes!
[05:39:04] <arschmitz> ok panel issue check ill look at filterable now
[05:39:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I put some links on the page itself and test again
[05:40:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good let me know if you have any further issues
[05:40:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think my bug report deserves "DBR" label ;)
[05:40:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will do, thanks
[05:40:53] <arschmitz> lol :)
[05:41:22] <arschmitz> i suprised i noticed after actually typeing 10s5 for iOS5
[05:44:15] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:45:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: this is probably me just being picky but it drives me nuts when _create is not the first method

[05:49:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll fix it. Sorry!
[05:50:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just nicer to read i think when _create is first
[05:51:21] <arschmitz> kinda read down the code i know im crazy lol you dont need to fix it
[05:51:36] <arschmitz> its just me im sure
[05:53:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nah, I'll fix it. I was thinking that we should have somekind of template for these things.
[05:53:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all i care too much about it options then create
[05:53:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... not to be implemented before 1.4.0, for sure, but since this internal-only we can easily do it later.
[05:54:07] <arschmitz> yeah thats fine
[05:54:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or right after we tag 1.4.0, because then we no longer need to merge stuff that may cause unnecessary conflicts.
[05:54:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: After 1.4.0, we could also do the UI thing where we rebase more often.
[05:57:11] <uGoMobi> +1
[05:57:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah ugh dont mention conflicts my rebase last night with all the new branches from yesterday was rough because autoinit touches like every file
[06:01:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yikes!
[06:04:33] <_|Nix|_> Man, I feel like we're gonna be deprecating half the library :)
[06:06:30] <arschmitz> nah only 1/3
[06:07:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: is there a reason why options are being updated manually instead of just calling this._super()?
[06:08:19] <frequent> _|Nix|_: hey. 
[06:08:27] <frequent> _|Nix|_: When you have a minute, I finished "poking" at query-parameters in URLs.
[06:08:29] <frequent> _|Nix|_: There wasn't much to change in JQM, although my sample URLs are kind of easy. If you have a minute (and unzipped-code-patience), http://www.franckreich.de/members/export/l/search.html?search=vila - try searching for "soon" or "paris" (enter or submit). Pages will only be in the DOM once, will be reloaded with new ?search=param and can also be reversed.
[06:08:30] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I can PR tonight if you want to have a look at the modifications I did.
[06:09:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you mean? Where?
[06:09:43] <_|Nix|_> frequent: OK. PR away. I'm curious.

[06:09:58] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06ext-panels 149a2ea41 15Jasper de Groot: Panel: Correction in event unbinding. Code cleanup.
[06:10:31] <_|Nix|_> frequent: Very nice!
[06:10:45] <frequent> _|Nix|_: thx
[06:11:13] <frequent> seems to work cleanly on FF, Chrome, Opera (don't have more here to test)
[06:11:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because this.options.children needs to have the new value so that when refresh() gets called at the bottom of that function the filter it initiates is performed on the correct children.
[06:12:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so call super in the middle
[06:12:31] <arschmitz> after you check the options but before you call refresh
[06:12:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... not a bad point.
[06:14:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: other then that main filterable looks ok looking at backcompat now
[06:16:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: shouldn't filterable have a destroy method that shows anything thats currently hidden?
[06:18:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. I should remove all the .ui-screen-hidden classes.
[06:18:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[06:19:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Technically I should restore the textinput's placeholder as well.
[06:19:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That filterPlaceholder parameter is sooo annoying.
[06:19:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and it's gonna be deprecated, too.
[06:19:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:21:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's a snag: If someone sets this.options.children to something else during the lifetime of the filterable, I'll be removing ui-sceen-hidden from the new children, not the original children :)
[06:21:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I should just do one last filter with a value of "".
[06:22:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but initally its fair to assume nothing is hidden
[06:22:13] <arschmitz> right?
[06:22:19] <arschmitz> so nothing should be hidden at the end
[06:22:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, unless enhanced is true and filterReveal is also true, in which case initially everything is hidden.
[06:22:44] <arschmitz> ok so check filterReveal
[06:22:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because the user has manually applied ui-screen-hidden in the original markup.
[06:22:57] <arschmitz> and either hide or show everything based on that
[06:23:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's what I'm doing.
[06:23:11] <arschmitz> ok
[06:23:50] <arschmitz> and if someone wants to randomly throw around widget classes on an enhanced widget thats their own issue lol
[06:24:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ha! What if someone turned off filterReveal during the lifetime of an already-enhanced filterable?
[06:24:26] <arschmitz> we cant track every option change
[06:24:45] <arschmitz> people need to be reasonable
[06:24:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, or we need to have DOM transactions.
[06:25:04] <arschmitz> which dont exist yet
[06:25:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll apply the latest known value of filterReveal if it's enhanced, and I'll show everything if it's not.
[06:25:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and then I'll wash my hands of the matter.
[06:29:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yaaay! Calling _super() at the top of _setOptions saved me 4 LOC :)
[06:29:01] <arschmitz> lol
[06:29:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not at top though right after you check all the options passed?
[06:30:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: like here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6192/files#L16R207
[06:30:07] <b-ot> arschmitz: Pull request #6192 by gabrielschulhof (6d 27m ago): Filter widget review
[06:30:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, it's safe to set it at the top, because I use the option values for nothing else than to decide whether to call refresh().
[06:30:41] <arschmitz> ah ok
[06:31:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Besides, chain first/chain last are the most common ways to chain up.
[06:31:36] <arschmitz> all right i think filterable looks ok with those changes 
[06:31:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[06:32:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes but if you had needed to check this.options.x which is common in setOptions you would need to do it after that but before refresh
[06:32:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, like, to compare the existing value with the new value. I know, that's an issue.
[06:32:33] <arschmitz> but not the case here
[06:32:36] <_|Nix|_> Nope.
[06:33:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think one of collapsible/controlgroup also needs this call-super-at-the-top treatment, IIRC.
[06:33:28] <arschmitz> ok now that thats done 
[06:33:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet it's collapsiblel.
[06:33:38] <arschmitz> hmm must have missed it when i read them
[06:34:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I might just be remembering wrong.
[06:34:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's all a blur.
[06:35:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D'ah! filterable backcompat destroy now has to chain up.
[06:35:00] <arschmitz> you do it for inset in collapsible
[06:35:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[06:35:18] <arschmitz> thats actually why i realized it was missing
[06:35:44] <arschmitz> i saw the backcompat one and was like wait a second i dont remember one from the main widget
[06:35:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, so collapsible needs some love.
[06:36:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I better write a test to make sure the destroy works.
[06:36:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: collapsible might be ok its a weird case because of its interaction with corners
[06:37:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it is kinda weird.
[06:37:09] <arschmitz> because it needs to be set before corners but corners needs to also check original options
[06:37:18] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[06:37:28] <_|Nix|_> St00pid non-orthogonal options ...
[06:37:36] <arschmitz> so i would leave as is for now
[06:37:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[06:37:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll write the destroy-test and then merge.
[06:37:54] <arschmitz> cool

[07:15:11] <frequent> _|Nix|_: Bon!
[07:15:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so by total coincidence had basically the exact opposite conversation as you had with scott_gonzalez: about git merge yesterday they wanted to know how to always force a merge commit
[07:15:24] <arschmitz> even when its fast forward
[07:15:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, that's easy.
[07:15:43] <arschmitz> yeah --no--ff
[07:15:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: --no-ff
[07:16:06] <arschmitz> i just thought it was funny timing it was right after and exactly the oppisite desired effect
[07:16:11] <_|Nix|_> IINM, github used to do that for PRs.
[07:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: It didn't even warrant a response of any kind :-/
[07:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to say something like "Yeah, have you seen our roadmap?"
[07:17:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: you should have said your absolutly right about it being a sieve its sorts out many of the bad parts for you
[07:17:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's not really the opposite. The branch that ends up getting --no-ff -merged may have been rebased any number of times, so the merge commit just marks the fact that this used to be a branch.
[07:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:17:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just meant in that one was trying to avoid merge commits and the other wants to force them
[07:18:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess it's not so bad rebasing branches as long as we recognize the warning signs of our local branch being not-really-the-same as the upstream on.
[07:18:14] <_|Nix|_> s/on\.$/one./
[07:18:16] <tj_vantoll> It just astounds me that someone would take time out of their life to bother to create that. But I guess this is the internet.
[07:19:07] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: need to give tj_vantoll: the link to that apostrophe article lol 
[07:19:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although I sure wish I knew a quick equivalent to git pull --rebase origin the-branch that will discard the local branch, grab the remote branch, and rebase the local-only commits on top of the freshly-imported branch.
[07:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=68
[07:21:08] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup thats the one
[07:25:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: are you talking about something like http://git-scm.com/2010/03/08/rerere.html
[07:26:05] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: are you around?
[07:26:18] <arschmitz> saves when you fix a conflict and how you did it so you dont have to do it again
[07:26:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[07:26:37] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: what's up?
[07:26:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: git always seems to have the answer :)
[07:26:59] <uGoMobi> hey jl
[07:27:02] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: 
[07:27:03] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:27:09] <jlembeck> hey :D
[07:27:17] <uGoMobi> was using changelog agan for 1.4 alpha
[07:27:27] <uGoMobi> and run into similar issue as last time
[07:27:34] <uGoMobi> one sec..
[07:27:48] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: generator.rb:22:in `block in create_commits': undefined method `downcase' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)
[07:27:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not exactly. I was thinking about the situation when you find that the upstream branch by the same name as your local branch actually branches off master at a totally different point and all the commits have the same content as your local branch but different commitids.
[07:28:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: i.e., the upstream branch has been rebased by someone else.
[07:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> rerere has always seemed like the scariest part of git. I don't think I will ever turn it on.
[07:28:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Now, your local branch has additional commits on top of the ones that upstream used to share before it got rebased.
[07:28:39] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: means I'm not doing a nil check in a place I should be (this is my "angry at myself" face)
[07:28:59] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: yeah I figured that was the problem
[07:29:07] <uGoMobi> was looking at your last fix
[07:29:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you need to discard the local branch, since it no longer reflects the situation upstream, grab the upstream branch, and apply the extra commits you had to the newly fetched branch.
[07:29:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i dont have it turned on either just seemed like the answer to the porblem
[07:29:26] <uGoMobi> but don't really know ruby so didn't know how to apply it here https://github.com/filamentgroup/changelog/blob/master/changelog/generator.rb#L22
[07:29:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This seems like a chore, unless git has some shortcut for exactly this workflow.
[07:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yeah, rerere would've made a rebase on that branch work without conflicts.
[07:29:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. If I ever have to fix the same conflict again, then I'm doing something wrong.
[07:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: But it means that you need to never make a mistake during a conflict resolution.
[07:30:15] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yup
[07:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: We should really avoid using ruby as part of a release process.
[07:31:07] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: uGoMobi: agreed. I can rewrite that thing in node
[07:31:13] <_|Nix|_> I had this fix-the-same-conflict-again issue when I was working on a downstream port of an app. I had many parallel feature branches and I would merge upstream's master into each one. The same conflict would come up over and over and over.
[07:31:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not really if you rebase multiple times from master to a branch it will remember your resolutions so you dont have to do them again
[07:31:25] <jlembeck> or in bash, if need be
[07:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely not bash.
[07:31:42] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: yup but don't have time to implement UI's changelog script
[07:32:06] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: there is a JS solution already ^^
[07:32:23] <jlembeck> the UI one? how far off is it from being able to work with jQM?
[07:32:30] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js#L368
[07:32:51] <uGoMobi> I don't know, didn't have time yet to look into it
[07:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Are your changelogs commits only, issues only, or both?
[07:33:57] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: both
[07:34:31] <scott_gonzalez> So the answer to how close it is to working with Mobile is: The GitHub integration would need to be written for getting a list of issues.
[07:36:08] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15BrazilianJoe opened issue #6208: button() not creating 2 controlgroups in same container  02http://git.io/NGFnpA
[07:38:40] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: I pushed a fix, hopefully that will help for now, I can rewrite later, but need to head into the workspace
[07:38:55] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: awesome, thanks a lot
[07:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> jlembeck: Will this be public?
[07:39:26] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: absolutely
[07:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> Good :-) The current one is not.
[07:40:56] <jlembeck> scott_gonzalez: uGoMobi: How long do I have to get this to you? (Planning my day) Is it of immediate need?
[07:41:38] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: we are planning on releasing in a few hours
[07:42:00] <jlembeck> oh wow. ok. Can you try to run the ruby version again?
[07:42:14] <jlembeck> my getting to a place will take an hour +
[07:42:24] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: I just want to put up a changelog somewhere when announcing the alpha release
[07:42:32] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: I am running it now
[07:46:18] <_|Nix|_> frequent: One thing about the table widget review: table has two extensions: reflow and columntoggle, right? So, when you chain up with super in a method like refresh and both reflow and columntoggle chain up to table, then you have to remember that both reflow and columntoggle 
[07:46:30] <_|Nix|_> may end up in the application, in which case they will be chainged.
[07:46:38] <_|Nix|_> chained.
[07:46:48] <_|Nix|_> So, you'll have table <- columntoggle <- reflow.
[07:47:02] <_|Nix|_> Meaning that when reflow calls _super() it will end up in columntoggle, not table.
[07:47:16] <frequent> _|Nix|_: ok
[07:47:20] <frequent> which means?
[07:47:32] <_|Nix|_> So, when you write columntoggle-specific code in one of these chainable methods, you must always put it inside a if ( this.options.mode === "columntoggle" );
[07:47:47] <_|Nix|_> frequent: ... otherwise you're gonna end up running columntoggle-specific code on a reflow table.
[07:48:28] <frequent> _|Nix|_: yes, I was fighting with that for a while. But thought it was working...
[07:48:35] <_|Nix|_> frequent: I kinda wish we could apply extensions to individual instances, rather than protos.
[07:48:43] <frequent> hm...
[07:49:23] <frequent> but for that I'm the wrong fairy to place  a wish to ;-)
[07:49:27] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: I don't get errors but it doesn't seem to output all commits
[07:49:48] <_|Nix|_> frequent: :)
[07:50:12] <uGoMobi> pfff 1560 commits since tag 1.3.0

[07:54:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What?! You want my browser to crash?!
[07:54:48] <_|Nix|_> "This comparison is big! We're only showing the most recent 250 commits "
[07:54:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lol... GH protects you
[07:55:00] <uGoMobi> it only shows last 250
[07:55:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it protects itself too ... it's probably quite a job computing the changes.

[08:13:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz : have a moment to discuss what we still need to do for alpha release?
[08:14:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[08:14:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ ?
[08:15:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: let's wait until _|Nix|_ is back
[08:16:02] <arschmitz> ok just let me know when
[08:16:08] <uGoMobi> yup
[08:16:17] <arschmitz> im just finishing flipswitch tests so that it can be merged
[08:16:34] <arschmitz> iv got over a dozen already so really anytime just trying to be thorough 
[08:16:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great!
[08:16:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I haven't updated the panel tests yet :/
[08:17:01] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: how far is it off
[08:17:03] <jlembeck> ?
[08:17:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as long as current ones pass i would not worry about it
[08:17:22] <arschmitz> i can add those afrer alpha if need be
[08:17:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: they don't but I think/hope it's mostly because I changed class names

[08:18:23] <jlembeck> oh wow, a LOT a lot
[08:19:08] <uGoMobi> jlembeck:  at the other hand... if it would output all 1560 commits I would need a week to clean it up
[08:19:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm here.
[08:19:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I don't think I have anything that I can't do post-alpha.
[08:20:06] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: yeah, covering issues and commits and topics, etc. it takes major cleanup time.
[08:20:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is introducing a new extension kosher post-alpha?
[08:20:15] <jlembeck> Todd spent a solid day after the last time
[08:20:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's basically refactoring the theme class calculation code.
[08:20:33] <arschmitz> not really
[08:20:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There're no API changes or anything.
[08:20:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... OK.
[08:20:42] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: I am thinking of creating a changelog from issue tickets and add some stuff manually
[08:20:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: what exactly are you proposing?
[08:21:01] * _|Nix|_ fetches link from GH
[08:21:24] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: we can look into a solid solution later, not realistic to resolve this today
[08:21:54] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[08:21:54] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: solid. Will talk this out later on then, I'd be more than happy to rewrite this
[08:22:18] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: sounds good, thanks for your help with this!
[08:22:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: 
[08:22:27] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L104
[08:22:30] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L224
[08:22:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : sorry I missed where you guys are talking about
[08:22:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd like to factor that out, because it's useful whenever you're dealing with changing themes.
[08:23:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know popup could use it for sure.
[08:23:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently it parses className with a regex to find the existing theme :/
[08:23:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dunno seems overkill to make an extension for a single line
[08:24:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not saying dont use this on popup or whatever im just not sure about an extension 
[08:24:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : what is the problem we are discussing?
[08:24:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. It's a tough call, especially if we want to get rid of theme-related options.
[08:25:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think id punt use it where needed an call it a day its an extra dependency and its a single line
[08:26:24] <arschmitz> its something we are getting rid of anyway
[08:26:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I hope.
[08:26:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll forego it.
[08:27:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's at times like these I really wish we had a preprocessor.
[08:28:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyhoo ... just wanted to factor out swatch-to-theme conversion.
[08:29:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi and i had also talked about making theme defualt to inherit
[08:29:21] <arschmitz> so that it always has a value
[08:29:27] <uGoMobi> right
[08:29:32] <_|Nix|_> Not bad.
[08:29:43] <uGoMobi> but this is something for 1.5
[08:29:44] <_|Nix|_> However, how does that jive with backcompat?
[08:30:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: same as the rest of theme change
[08:30:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We must then deprecate the default values for things ... or can those change without a deprecation period?
[08:30:16] <arschmitz> that is the defualt value no regardless
[08:30:40] <arschmitz> not sure how i got a random no in the middle of that
[08:30:41] <uGoMobi> I don't think we have to deprecate a default
[08:30:47] <_|Nix|_> OK, but in 1.3.x, the default swatch is most often "c", except for header/footer, where it's "a".
[08:30:48] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:30:55] <_|Nix|_> OK, I hope not.
[08:31:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but everything is inherit by defualt now
[08:31:10] <arschmitz> thats how the theme works
[08:31:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's great!
[08:31:41] <arschmitz> but in some places we are checking null and if null use inherit
[08:31:54] <arschmitz> so would be better to just make it inherit
[08:31:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, and what about "none"?
[08:31:57] <uGoMobi> yeah make the option value "inherit" by default instead of null will give the same result as it is now on master
[08:32:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly
[08:32:32] <_|Nix|_> Well, null === inherit for collapsible too.
[08:32:51] <_|Nix|_> Most collapsible options have a value of null, so they inherit from the accordion by default.
[08:32:54] <uGoMobi> where is the current situation (master) causing a problem?
[08:33:02] <arschmitz> there is not one
[08:33:08] <arschmitz> its just a change _|Nix|_ wanted
[08:33:24] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, how do we handle a theme value of "none"?
[08:33:34] <_|Nix|_> Like, I don't want this themed. Not inherited, not anything.
[08:34:13] <arschmitz> is that a documented value for that option?
[08:34:30] <uGoMobi> I think that might be different for some widgets
[08:34:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm pretty sure. We have that FF logo popup example.
[08:34:39] <uGoMobi> so that is something to improve
[08:34:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That illustrates the theme="none" option.
[08:34:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont see it anywhere in the api though
[08:35:29] <arschmitz> yeah none is not documented in the api docs at all
[08:35:45] <uGoMobi> I actually want to look into removing option theme from the widgets
[08:35:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The same FF logo example exists in the API docs.
[08:36:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: "Possible values: swatch letter (a-z)."
[08:36:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I guess "none" has the same effect as ui-body-xyzzy
[08:36:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although now with inheritance, this changes.
[08:36:50] <gseguin> rworth: I've got the blurb and the logo for JetBrains. How do I add it to the sponsors page?
[08:37:35] <rworth> gseguin just do a PR on the jquery.org repo https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/
[08:37:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : I don't think we should look into this for 1.4 alpha
[08:37:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, some really funky nav stuff goes on in Chrome 28 when you open a popup in an http://api.jquerymobile.com/popup/ iframe!
[08:37:48] <arschmitz> i agree
[08:37:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's fine.
[08:37:55] <uGoMobi> otherwise we never finish the release
[08:37:56] <gseguin> rworth: cool thanks
[08:38:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, agreed.
[08:38:23] <uGoMobi> if it turns out there is an issue with this somewhere we fix it for beta or 1.4.1
[08:38:27] <_|Nix|_> We can still do internal stuff after alpha. I have a few things in mind, especially for popup - like removing that st00pid regex-based theme swapping.
[08:39:10] <uGoMobi> sure, as long as we work in branch and do PR's
[08:39:27] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[08:39:28] <uGoMobi> we can check with UI guys if it is ok according to semver to merge
[08:39:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just depends on whats being done
[08:40:04] <uGoMobi> I know
[08:40:09] <arschmitz> cant be anything a user would interact with basicly
[08:40:13] <uGoMobi> but I am not semver specalist
[08:40:23] <arschmitz> cant change api in any way shape or form
[08:40:43] <uGoMobi> so it's good to ask Scott and Jorn who have more experience with this
[08:40:51] <_|Nix|_> I'm thinking maybe performance improvements and stuff.
[08:41:05] <_|Nix|_> That's totally internal.
[08:41:18] <uGoMobi> but now we are talking post alpha
[08:41:29] <uGoMobi> let's talk alpha first :)
[08:41:30] <arschmitz> yes lets get back to what needs to be done today
[08:41:35] <uGoMobi> exactly
[08:41:54] <_|Nix|_> One last look at table-widget-review for sure.
[08:42:00] <_|Nix|_> ... before I merge.
[08:42:05] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:42:13] <uGoMobi> I finished my work on ext-panels but need to update some tests
[08:42:25] <arschmitz> need to finish flipswitch tests and merge
[08:42:25] <uGoMobi> and it needs to be reviewed for sure
[08:42:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can look at it when im done with flipswitch and giving tables a quick look over
[08:42:59] <arschmitz> flipswitch tests are essentially done 15 is enough to start i think
[08:43:09] <uGoMobi> ok great
[08:43:15] <uGoMobi> one thing re: panels
[08:43:23] <uGoMobi> I noticed a zoom issue on Android
[08:43:30] <arschmitz> ok
[08:43:35] <arschmitz> 4.2?
[08:43:51] <uGoMobi> the problem is gone if we don't enable/disable zoom
[08:43:54] <uGoMobi> yes 4.2
[08:43:59] <uGoMobi> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431
[08:43:59] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5431 by hikalkan (6mon 1w ago): Solution to flicker problem in jQuery mobile page transitions!
[08:44:09] <uGoMobi> that's basically the same
[08:44:40] <arschmitz> so it makes transitions bad?
[08:44:41] <uGoMobi> we call zoom.js when an option in fixedtoolbar is set to true
[08:44:46] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Zothos opened issue #6209: Fixed Toolbar flckers on orientationchange when <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" /> is set  02http://git.io/ZHqHPQ
[08:45:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it zooms out when opening panel 
[08:45:33] <arschmitz> ok
[08:45:51] <arschmitz> i assume only if zoom is not disabled
[08:46:03] <uGoMobi> there might be another way to fix this with an overflow setting, but I didn't find the solution
[08:46:28] <uGoMobi> what I want to suggest is to change the default for that option in fixed toolbar to false
[08:46:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that will break ios
[08:47:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you talking about preventFocusZoom
[08:47:26] <uGoMobi> or iOS needs it for fixed toolbars?
[08:47:35] <uGoMobi> I thought it was added for Android
[08:47:35] <arschmitz> ios needs it for fixed toolbars
[08:47:41] <uGoMobi> I see :(
[08:47:55] <arschmitz> maybe iv got it backwards let me check super fast
[08:47:58] <uGoMobi> didn't see a problem on iPad / iOS6
[08:48:16] <uGoMobi> the commit message wasn't really clear why the feature has been added
[08:48:31] <uGoMobi> we also use it for textinput and select preventFocusZoom
[08:48:35] <uGoMobi> that can stay
[08:49:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: are you still working on table review?
[08:49:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No.
[08:49:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok kindle fire needs zoom disabled, so does android 2.x
[08:49:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm ok
[08:49:42] <arschmitz> ios is fine
[08:49:54] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Position:fixed-and-Overflow:-testing
[08:50:02] <uGoMobi> thanks
[08:50:40] <uGoMobi> ok, so we have to review and merge ext-panels and flipswitch
[08:50:44] <arschmitz> so unless we stop supporting fixed toolbars on 2.x we cant change that
[08:50:50] <uGoMobi> and table-review
[08:50:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[08:51:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, have to think what to do with it
[08:51:46] <uGoMobi> anything else that needs to be done for alpha _|Nix|_ ?
[08:51:47] <arschmitz> if only 2.x was not 40+%
[08:51:54] <uGoMobi> right :(
[08:52:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not AFAICT>
[08:52:34] <uGoMobi> ok great
[08:52:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Demos don't have to be tip-top  for alpha, right?
[08:52:49] <uGoMobi> I have to get a blog post ready and a changelog
[08:52:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: correct
[08:53:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I did some quick fixing but they aren't updated
[08:53:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, we need to add pre-rendered examples for just about every widget.
[08:53:42] <_|Nix|_> Actually, come to think of it, this may have to go to the API docs as well, because it documents the structure of the widget.
[08:53:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how about auto init?
[08:54:07] <arschmitz> wont be done for alpha
[08:54:15] <arschmitz> but is ok post alpha
[08:54:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok clear
[08:54:25] <arschmitz> this was already approved by scott
[08:54:38] <arschmitz> just ran out of time with other stuff :(
[08:54:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nothing on master has been changed regarding auto init, right?
[08:54:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, tell me about it!
[08:55:02] <uGoMobi> this only lives in a branch
[08:55:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[08:55:11] <uGoMobi> ok good
[08:55:16] <arschmitz> and its fully backwars compatible
[08:55:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, master has changed in that it uses $.mobile._enhancer().
[08:55:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... since 1.3.z.
[08:55:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its not public or documented so i can yank it with out issue
[08:55:46] <uGoMobi> right
[08:55:59] <_|Nix|_> That's true, I'm just saying, it /has/ changed, just not visible.
[08:56:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[08:56:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how much time do you need for finishing flipswitch and reviewing the other 2 branches?
[08:56:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll add a comment to registry.js that this will most likely be gone by the final release.
[08:56:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok
[08:57:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: reviewing tabled maybe 30 minutes
[08:57:13] <_|Nix|_> Oh, one more thing!
[08:57:19] <arschmitz> flipswitch probably in ten minutes will be good
[08:57:24] <uGoMobi> wow
[08:57:34] <arschmitz> panel hard to say since i have not looked at whats failing yet
[08:57:41] <uGoMobi> I understand
[08:57:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When we grab the new widget factory, we can get rid of enable() and disable() from the base class - unless you've already done that.
[08:57:49] * _|Nix|_ has lost track
[08:57:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats part of autoinit
[08:58:03] <uGoMobi> it sounds more like we will be waiting for me finishing a blog post and changelog
[08:58:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, good.
[08:58:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Pray that this is so :)
[08:58:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: then i can just get both changes and update $.widget extension all at once
[08:58:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. Cool!
[09:00:02] <arschmitz> ok so im going to finish up flipswitch tests then that branch is good to go
[09:01:37] <uGoMobi> I am thinking I am going to keep blog post simple and make a changelog from closed tickets and the wiki page, then I do more blog posts later to zoom in on highlights with nice screenshots and such
[09:01:46] <uGoMobi> saves time now and we get more buzz
[09:02:08] <uGoMobi> we also have to work on an upgrade guide
[09:02:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah dont yell too loud on this one incase we have missed anythign in last second rush
[09:02:25] <arschmitz> really push the beta one 
[09:02:34] <uGoMobi> I agree
[09:02:41] <uGoMobi> but I do want people to test
[09:02:46] <arschmitz> exactly
[09:03:19] <arschmitz> do full changelog highlights / upgrade guide etc for beta
[09:03:25] <arschmitz> and really push people to test it
[09:03:43] <arschmitz> this one just get it out there so people can start playing with the theme and such
[09:04:04] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:04:17] <arschmitz> theme is single biggest change so be good to see how that goes
[09:04:24] <uGoMobi> will post on twitter, linkedin, G+ etc to ask people to test
[09:04:32] <arschmitz> yup
[09:04:51] <uGoMobi> with the 1.4 final release we will switch to new website template
[09:05:07] <uGoMobi> so there is enough happening
[09:05:43] <arschmitz> yeah been folowing that it will be great to fit in with the rest fo the crowd lol
[09:05:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you check https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog and see if big things are missing
[09:06:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On it.
[09:06:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, about time ;)
[09:06:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great thanks
[09:06:44] <uGoMobi> also... we have ~100 1.4.0 tickets but on ~50 closed :/
[09:07:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I make a section for deprecation?
[09:07:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[09:08:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: please do im going to add a bunch
[09:08:17] <arschmitz> lol
[09:08:27] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:08:48] <arschmitz> just simply put the word EVERYTHING and call it a day
[09:09:29] <_|Nix|_> Wait ... removal of button inner markup is not a deprecation - it's an outright removal.
[09:09:47] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[09:10:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "The feature to auto-detect thumbs and icons has been deprecated to improve performance." 
[09:10:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it still there though?
[09:10:56] <didiergm_> uGoMobi: I thought popup & dialog could work outside of a page in 1.4
[09:11:05] <_|Nix|_> popup can.
[09:11:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes it is still there
[09:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, then it's a deprecation.
[09:11:41] <uGoMobi> didiergm_: dialog is a page
[09:13:35] <didiergm_> uGoMobi - yes sorry
[09:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHAHA https://twitter.com/sunburntkamel/status/360423592447586304
[09:19:25] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @sunburntkamel: seriously #bootstrap that is not a customize page.  go look at jqueryUI's example and sit in the corner and think about what you've done.
[09:22:19] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:22:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog
[09:22:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: awesome! thanks!
[09:23:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should deprecate theme-, corners-, shadow-, and mini-related options.
[09:23:17] <uGoMobi> we can also do a separate blog post to show performance improvements
[09:23:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I hope we have some :)
[09:23:29] <uGoMobi> with test results from those students
[09:23:38] <uGoMobi> :)
[09:24:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I was thinking about that too
[09:24:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, should I add it?
[09:24:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Got a link to those perf improvements?
[09:24:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll add that too.
[09:25:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think with data-wrapper-class we can easily do without the options.
[09:26:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, and it should also work with class on a container
[09:26:18] <uGoMobi> but didn't look into possible issues yet
[09:26:39] <uGoMobi> that's why I wasn't sure if we should deprecate now or wait until 1.5
[09:26:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, the only issue with that is the ui-mini problem, where you want all children to be mini except one.
[09:26:48] <arschmitz> ok guys i gota run for a bit
[09:26:56] <arschmitz> before i throw my laptop out the window
[09:26:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, let's wait.
[09:27:03] <arschmitz> ill be back in a bit
[09:27:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No! Give it to me instead!
[09:27:11] <uGoMobi> later arschmitz :)
[09:27:13] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:27:15] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:27:17] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[09:27:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes but that mini problem is easy to fix with opposite class
[09:27:56] <uGoMobi> mini is just a few rules in core.css now
[09:28:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, in fact for all options that can have exceptions like that we need an opposite class.
[09:28:32] <uGoMobi> was more thinking about shadow etc
[09:28:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For example, with accordion, you can now have all collapsibles inset except for one.
[09:28:44] <uGoMobi> yeah probably
[09:29:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looks kinda weird, but not so bad. Like, if you want to "lift out" one collapsible from the rest.
[09:29:21] <uGoMobi> I think we need at least one version with both the JS options and adding class in markup 
[09:29:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[09:29:31] <uGoMobi> so let's deprecate that in 1.5
[09:29:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[09:29:55] <uGoMobi> also, I don't want people to think... more theming changes, I skip 1.4 and wait for 1.5
[09:30:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and I think deprecation implies that the new system is already in place.
[09:30:38] <uGoMobi> yes exactly
[09:30:52] <uGoMobi> that's why I am also not sure about deprecating dialog
[09:31:05] <uGoMobi> we didn't add the option dialog to page widget yet
[09:31:23] <_|Nix|_> That's true.
[09:31:52] <_|Nix|_> I guess if we don't deprecate it now we can still get rid of it in 1.5.0 and re-implement it using page.
[09:32:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah good one
[09:33:16] <_|Nix|_> We can even make it a straight jQuery plugin: $.fn.dialog = function( options ) { this.page( $.extend( {}, options, { dialog: true } ); };
[09:33:35] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:34:05] <_|Nix|_> Oh, sorry, one more line in that function: this.data( "mobile-dialog", this.data( "mobile-page" ) ) in case anybody uses the widget directly.
[09:34:06] <uGoMobi> just have to check how data-attribute / rel="dialog on link
[09:34:39] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15BrazilianJoe closed issue #6208: button() not creating 2 controlgroups in same container  02http://git.io/NGFnpA
[09:34:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine. Popup does a lot of that.
[09:34:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like three of popup's options can be overridden with the link.
[09:35:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: positionTo, transition, and some others (I forget which) ... theme, maybe?
[09:35:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, just wasn't sure if we had any special case with dialogs
[09:36:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: re: the perf test results... those were from branch next
[09:36:35] <uGoMobi> I have access to a repo though
[09:36:41] <uGoMobi> or think it's even public
[09:36:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, yeah ... we're definitely on the path towards handling link-based options more systematically.
[09:36:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, you can always ask them to re-run on master.
[09:37:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm sure the element count is still valid,
[09:37:20] <uGoMobi> yes, will contact the guys
[09:37:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We haven't added any new elements.
[09:37:33] <uGoMobi> I hope so ;)
[09:37:44] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:50:12] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15miksh7 opened issue #6210: fix typo: 'throttleresize' => 'throttledresize'  02http://git.io/1YSJkg
[10:00:32] <didiergm_> I seem to remember that work was done on ui-tabs working with JQM 1.4 - it is still on for 1.4 or pushed back to later ?
[10:02:04] <uGoMobi> didiergm_: we integrated UI tabs
[10:03:16] <didiergm_> excellent news (on top of what the 1-4 Changelog already lists) can't wait to test the alpha
[10:04:42] <uGoMobi> ah good point, I'll add it to the list
[10:06:10] <didiergm_> and also popup outside page ? unless mistaken that's new in 1.4
[10:08:37] <uGoMobi> didiergm_: right, thanks
[10:53:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ toddmparker agcolom gseguin johnbender RWhitbeck https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VcH4GyrCc1h_b5fgVJRoras188BYidGMXcJrRif_rS0/edit?usp=sharing
[11:00:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I can't make myself op on -meeting, can you open the room?
[11:01:00] <uGoMobi> says my nick isn't registered but when I do NickServ IDENTIFY it says it is registered :/
[11:01:44] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: can you open -meeting for me?
[11:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: It's not muted.
[11:02:23] <uGoMobi> dang
[11:02:24] <uGoMobi> sorry
[11:02:26] <uGoMobi> and thanks
[11:02:44] <uGoMobi> still strange I can't op myself
[11:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> I tried and it said you weren't registered.
[11:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> Strange that NickServ is telling you that you are.
[11:18:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: re tabled widget var that = this ???? seems like a bad idea and i dont see the need you can just use this everywhere its used there is no place its used that != this
[11:19:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. I recoiled from that too.
[11:19:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can still try to delve into those nested .each()s, but ... ugh ...
[11:19:55] <arschmitz> nix no need
[11:20:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That was one of the reasons we postponed the review.
[11:20:07] <arschmitz> just delete that line and use this everywhere it uses that
[11:20:20] <arschmitz> there is nothing nested there
[11:20:33] <arschmitz> its just not needed 
[11:21:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're right. There's no inner .each().
[11:21:21] <arschmitz> yeah 
[11:21:33] <arschmitz> its just not needed at all
[11:21:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, I think it's there for "clarity", because the outer closure has $this, and so $this[ 0 ] !== this;
[11:21:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and using that makes it "clearer".
[11:22:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure i would agree
[11:22:13] <arschmitz> that it makes it clearer
[11:22:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hence the quotation marks :)
[11:22:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I have a way around it, since $this is being declared and used exactly once.
[11:22:50] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:23:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also pointless just do $( this ).each...
[11:23:22] <arschmitz> and then remove that = this
[11:23:29] <arschmitz> and replace all instances of that with this
[11:23:40] <arschmitz> i think this descripton is even more confusing then the problem ...
[11:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> $this should never be used as a variable name.
[11:23:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: And now it won't be.
[11:24:01] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i agree
[11:24:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: its all most as good as "that" for a variable name https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/76b959e49db24f3be7e6172242f36f9ee6434aeb/js/widgets/table.js#L67
[11:25:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Also, in the last line before coltally++ it uses .data(). It used to be .jqmData() ... I'm not sure why that's changed.
[11:25:05] <jquicommit> 01[13download.jqueryui.com01] 15rxaviers pushed 1 new commit to 06amd-build: 02http://git.io/2BUExw
[11:25:05] <jquicommit> 13download.jqueryui.com/06amd-build 148bbba9d 15Rafael Xavier de Souza: (WIP) Instead of changing all DownloadBuilder to expect an async build, changed rjs to return a Stream, which will be handled appropriately in Packer#zipTo and will have its async aspect taken care.
[11:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: `that` is the preferred name for a variable preserving`this` across contexts.
[11:25:25] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats not how its being used
[11:25:32] <arschmitz> there is no change of context
[11:25:47] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah ... "that" was being declared inside the innermost context.
[11:25:58] <scott_gonzalez> :/
[11:26:06] <arschmitz> so it would refer to the exact oppisit of what you would expect
[11:26:09] <arschmitz> thats the problem
[11:26:34] <_|Nix|_> The good thing is Finnish has three levels of indirection. So, if I ever need this/that/???? I can use tämä/tuo/se :)
[11:27:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that data call needs to change also
[11:27:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, we need jqmData().
[11:28:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see we access that data item in the extensions.
[11:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> The variable names in this function make me sad.
[11:28:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: very much so ....
[11:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> $el, coltally, sel
[11:29:00] <_|Nix|_> OK, I'll take this opportunite to rename them.
[11:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> .data( "cells", ... ) is also bad.
[11:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> You need to prefix the data keys.
[11:30:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $el -> table? What say you?
[11:30:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yes that plain wont work
[11:30:21] <arschmitz> if they change the namespace option which we have
[11:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: There's no namespace being used at all.

[11:30:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i know thats the problem
[11:31:12] <arschmitz> it should use the function jqmData
[11:31:18] <arschmitz> which adds it autopmaticly
[11:31:29] <arschmitz> execpt spelled right even
[11:32:00] <_|Nix|_> Holy fsck! columntoggle is also full of $that and stuff ...
[11:32:16] <arschmitz> i had not even made it that far yet
[11:33:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and so is reflow.
[11:33:31] <arschmitz> i would expect
[11:33:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I looked into columntoggle while moving .data( "cells" ) -> .jqmData( "cells" )
[11:33:55] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[11:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> Remove this too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/76b959e49db24f3be7e6172242f36f9ee6434aeb/js/widgets/table.js#L21
[11:34:35] <scott_gonzalez> Why aren't these just on the prototype if they're undefined? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/76b959e49db24f3be7e6172242f36f9ee6434aeb/js/widgets/table.js#L27-L37
[11:36:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also in reflow there is opts again and only even used twice that should go
[11:36:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We usually declare the per-instance variables in a $.exten( this, { ... } ); during _create;
[11:36:35] * johnbender waves
[11:36:37] <johnbender> sorry guys
[11:36:39] <johnbender> burried right now
[11:36:52] * johnbender runs back into his cave
[11:36:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP. Glad to hear from you!
[11:37:01] <arschmitz> same in column toggle
[11:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: ok
[11:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> Using $.extend() seems odd compared to just set setting the properties directly.
[11:37:35] <_|Nix|_> Well, in table.js _create, opts is being used twice. I think that warrants the declaration of the variable.
[11:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> No it doesn't.
[11:38:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Why not? Doesn't that help the minifier?
[11:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's a question for the minifier. But probably not.
[11:39:24] <_|Nix|_> Well, barely:
[11:39:25] <_|Nix|_> 		var o = this.options;
[11:39:25] <_|Nix|_> 		this.optionsthis.options
[11:39:41] <scott_gonzalez> Don't forget about gzip.
[11:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> Variable munging in just a small part of minification.
[11:40:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I guess I dunno enough about gzipping. I've only ever used it to make tarballs. Never on the Web.
[11:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> WHAT?!?
[11:40:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Sorry! I'm a n00b.
[11:41:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on any properly configured server pretty much everything is sent gziped
[11:41:35] <_|Nix|_> Wow, really? Like, the html file? and the css file?
[11:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yes.
[11:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's where most of your minification comes from.
[11:41:56] <arschmitz> yup
[11:42:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, but lemme guess: The user agent has to send a header saying it understands gzipped stuff.
[11:42:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Because all I ever do to test a Web server is GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n :)
[11:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, you need to send and Accept-Encoding header.
[11:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> Which every browser will send.
[11:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> Never make changes to try to help a minification tool without actually measuring what you're doing.
[11:44:03] <_|Nix|_> OK, so does three occurrences of this.options warrant declaring a variable for it?
[11:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[11:44:23] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Roger that!
[11:46:14] <_|Nix|_> My daughter mistook a bottle of lemon juice for a waterballoon :) LOLOLOL
[11:55:06] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... three instances of this.options = 14 bytes.
[11:55:32] <tj_vantoll> gzip works best on repeated strings, so if this.options appears a lot that would likely reduce the final size transferred. But it's tricky because only the minified version is being gzipped… so like Scott said you have to test it. And it's almost never worth worrying about.
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i guess just try and clean up the variable names in those files and call it good for today we dont have time to dive in any deeper 
[11:56:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[11:56:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We might wanna do a code reduction pass at some point.
[11:59:29] <_|Nix|_> Argh! The unit tests use .data() as well!

[12:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> At a minimum it needs to be colTally
[12:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> You have mixed spacing and quotes on some of these lines too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/76b959e49db2...0078dc5287f7#L3R114
[12:06:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also change $that
[12:07:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: $ is not allowed for var names correct?
[12:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[12:07:19] <arschmitz> also $cells
[12:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> No Hungarian notation.
[12:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> For some reason there's an exception for regex. I have no idea why.
[12:08:58] <_|Nix|_> OK, WTF?! Why would you call a variable "that" when there is no function inside the context ... *shake head*
[12:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to be clever with minification?
[12:11:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you mind removing Hungarian notation from ext-panels when you review it?
[12:11:31] <arschmitz> is it in there too?

[12:25:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not working on that now
[12:25:59] <arschmitz> ok ill jump in
[12:26:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: would be great if you can do that
[12:26:08] <uGoMobi> thanks a lot!
[12:38:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all the content... classes are gone from the classes object is this intentional?
[12:38:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:38:59] <arschmitz> were they replaced for just gone?
[12:40:06] <uGoMobi>  we were using different classes for wrapper and fixed toolbars but applying the same CSS
[12:41:05] <arschmitz> i see so they use classes from toolbars now?
[12:41:12] <uGoMobi> so there are replaced by one prefix that is used for display, position, open classes
[12:41:19] <uGoMobi> these are applied to bother wrapper and the fixed toolbars
[12:41:32] <arschmitz> ok
[12:42:00] <arschmitz> so like what is the class for contentWrap now?
[12:43:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pageWrapper
[12:43:54] <arschmitz> ok so do they just use all the pageXXX classes now
[12:44:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually that could have been just "wrapper"
[12:45:22] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15john531 opened issue #6211: More AutoComplete functionality.  02http://git.io/dmSg3g
[12:45:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pageContainer: "ui-panel-page-container" --> added to $.mobile.pagecontainer (body)
[12:45:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pageWrapper: "ui-panel-wrapper" --> wrapper
[12:46:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pageFixedToolbar: "ui-panel-fixed-toolbar" --> fixed toolbars inside or outside page
[12:47:21] <arschmitz> how about contentWrapOpen?
[12:47:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pageContentPrefix: "ui-panel-page-content" is the prefix for -display-x, -position-x, -open
[12:48:21] <uGoMobi> contentWrapOpen and fixedToolbarOpen are replaced by pageContentPrefix: "ui-panel-page-content" + "-open"
[12:48:31] <arschmitz> got ya
[12:49:16] <uGoMobi> that "content" in the class name is still a bit confusing
[12:49:28] <uGoMobi> so is that "page"
[12:49:31] <uGoMobi> :/
[12:49:55] <uGoMobi> how to make clear it's not the panel itself?
[12:50:42] <arschmitz> yeah i dunno lol 
[12:50:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyway, I made that change so we could remove half of the selectors in the CSS
[12:51:09] <uGoMobi> no gzip can beat that ;)
[12:51:21] <arschmitz> yeah its cool was just trying to figure out what to use to fix these tests
[12:51:31] <uGoMobi> yes I understand
[12:51:43] <uGoMobi> hope it's clear but if not just as
[12:51:45] <uGoMobi> ask*
[12:53:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what about modal it does not look like those changed but im getting failure there too
[12:54:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I didn't change the class but we might append it to body now
[12:54:10] <uGoMobi> instead of the page
[12:54:13] <uGoMobi> could that be it
[12:54:13] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:54:14] <arschmitz> ah ok
[12:54:16] <arschmitz> yup
[12:54:19] <uGoMobi> k
[12:57:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://view.jquerymobile.com/ext-panels/demos/widgets/panels/
[12:57:15] <arschmitz> is not working
[12:59:10] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:02:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the panel is treated gets page classes somehow
[13:02:45] <arschmitz> hmmmm
[13:03:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: where is the call to .panel() ?
[13:03:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: those are all internal panels
[13:03:28] <arschmitz> thats the plain old demo page
[13:03:49] <uGoMobi> hmm I see one panel outside the page
[13:03:57] <arschmitz> hmmm
[13:04:05] <arschmitz> so maybe its just the demo page messed up
[13:04:11] <uGoMobi> but that's probably caused by the panel widget
[13:04:17] <uGoMobi> that's also possible
[13:05:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all set
[13:05:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: #leftpanel3
[13:05:46] <arschmitz> one of the panels was outside the page
[13:05:50] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:06:05] <arschmitz> i probably moved it when i first first started and forgot
[13:06:19] <arschmitz> as a test before i made actual demo page
[13:06:20] <uGoMobi> yeah, happens
[13:06:38] <arschmitz> ok so moving on...
[13:07:02] <uGoMobi> not easy to inspect code with so much markup on the page ;))

[14:13:59] <uGoMobi> jquery.mobile.css should be theme.css + default icon.css + structure.css
[14:14:16] <uGoMobi> but i am not sure
[14:14:21] <arschmitz> yeah and its just theme + structure right?
[14:14:28] <arschmitz> let me look at what it does

[15:10:09] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yup
[15:10:29] <gseguin> ok, I'll do that but we should really automate that
[15:10:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi:  is that the only file

[15:11:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think it is (you could check my last commit in 1.3-stable where I did it for 1.3.2
[15:11:32] <uGoMobi> )

[15:41:08] <gseguin> ah shit
[15:41:21] <arschmitz> thats so weird its in the gruntfile
[15:41:34] <arschmitz> its like it just completely skips
[15:42:33] <gseguin> well, anyway aren't we supposed to move it somewhere else?
[15:42:48] <gseguin> maybe it's a sign that the time to do that is now
[15:42:49] <arschmitz> yes
[15:43:05] <arschmitz> should be on jquerymobile.com
[15:43:07] <gseguin> where is it supposed to go ?
[15:43:16] <arschmitz> but we are switching that to new wordpress site for final also
[15:43:31] <gseguin> so what should I do ?
[15:43:37] <arschmitz> not really sure WHERE on jquerymobile.com 
[15:43:49] <arschmitz> hmm id just put same old place for now i guess
[15:44:12] <arschmitz> and worry about this for final we are also switching the cdn soon so everything is kinda changing right now
[15:44:46] <gseguin> That's ok I can create a releases directory
[15:44:55] <gseguin> and stuff it under there
[15:45:02] <arschmitz> that works too
[15:45:20] <arschmitz> whatever you want to do is fine i think as long as we can give uGoMobi the link
[15:50:45] <gseguin> ok it's uploaded 
[15:51:26] <gseguin> http://jquerymobile.com/releases/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.zip

[16:24:36] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[16:24:45] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5880 is only kinda fixed though.
[16:24:45] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5880 by scyrizales (3mon 1w ago): Refresh method from tables doesn´t update recently added columns
[16:25:05] <_|Nix|_> The column list is updated, but the columns are initially hidden.
[16:25:25] <arschmitz> thats good enough i would say
[16:25:42] <arschmitz> i mean how are we supposed to predict your intent
[16:26:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe it's the example, too. I think it assigns priorities to the columns, and a sufficiently low prio would mean that it's hidden.
[16:26:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll change the example to have no prios.
[16:26:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[16:26:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and see if that fixes it.
[16:27:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[16:27:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just so you know i wont be around tomorrow
[16:27:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but if something comes up feel free to email me 
[16:28:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and ill probably try to jump on for a min to see if the place is burning down after 1.4 in the morning lol
[16:29:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I'm also planning a day off. I'll jump in after my daughter goes to bed though ... if she sleeps as much in the afternoon as she did today, that's gonna be around this time (02:30 AM).
[16:29:48] <arschmitz> lol
