[10:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ping
[10:24:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez finishing a meeting one sec
[10:25:26] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez what's up?
[10:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> Wondering if you started working on the menu stuff we discussed at the conf.
[10:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's next on my list, but I didn't want to duplicate efforts if you already started.
[10:26:47] <kborchers> i haven't but probably can tonight. i didn't have internet for the last half of vacation plus the wife would have killed me :)
[10:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, when did you get back?
[10:27:29] <kborchers> late yesterday
[10:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[10:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> How was it?
[10:28:18] <kborchers> good, HOT! we were in Dallas and then southern Texas about 2 hours south of Austin
[10:30:08] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez i should be able to do some work tonight though so if you have other items on your list, you can probably move on and I'll try to get menu knocked out
[10:33:26] <clarkbox> jzaefferer, can you point me to a file that needs to be "transcoded" from the CLDR repo?
[10:33:58] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI build #571: SUCCESS in 8 min 54 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/571/
[10:33:58] <jq-jenkins> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Menu: Remove extraneous spaces from selector.
[10:33:59] <jq-jenkins> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Tests: Add jQuery 1.6.2 to testswarm-multi-jquery grunt task.
[10:34:05] <clarkbox> I'm not exactly sure what does, and does not need to be converted to our format.
[10:34:06] * gnarf cheers
[10:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Cool, I'll work on something else.
[10:47:40] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: not really, I've never looked at the data the CLDR has
[10:48:33] <clarkbox> ok ill hunt around for the data we want.
[10:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: We want more than what's in Globalize.
[10:49:17] <scott_gonzalez> Globalize + current datepicker i18n files will give you a good idea of what we want.
[10:49:26] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: we only have an output target. Though if you can find something for relative time values like "x hours ago", that would be pretty useful as well. Something moment.js has and we might consider adding
[10:49:46] <clarkbox> ok
[11:07:32] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery UI Release Coverage build #14: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20Release%20Coverage/14/

[11:07:33] <jq-jenkins> * Scott Gonz√°lez: Tests: Add jQuery 1.6.2 to testswarm-multi-jquery grunt task.
[11:43:47] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Effects pass against jquery-git when I run manually.
[12:06:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: joy - hate those bugs
[12:06:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe it would pass on a second pass?
[12:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> maybe
[12:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what we should do about the 1.6.2 fails.
[12:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> We'd either need to patch over .animate() or just let it fail.
[12:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Or we could not run the tests :-P
[12:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> if ( jQuery.fn.jquery !== "1.6.2" ) { ... }
[12:08:56] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> If core didn't have regressions, this wouldn't be a problem :-)
[12:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> You know, jQuery UI has never regressed.
[12:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Honest.
[12:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> We've also never had a major release go backwards in version numbers...
[12:23:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: um
[12:23:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think that test actually is testing $.effects.restore
[12:23:39] <gnarf> which uses .css
[12:23:46] <gnarf> prolly .css({ width: "" })
[12:23:48] <gnarf> etc
[12:24:12] <gnarf> which apparently there was a regression in 1.6.2 on that behavior that was then fixed in 1.7?
[12:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? There are a lot of missing versions in core's Trac: http://cl.ly/0l3H343Q1Q3n0c0Q0E1b
[12:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Not helpful: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?component=core&milestone=1.6.3&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=component&order=priority
[12:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> gah, not even the right component /o\
[12:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> Fixing the component doesn't help either: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?component=css&milestone=1.6.3
[12:30:08] <DaveMethvin> whar did our versions go?
[12:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[12:30:55] <gnarf> ?
[12:31:08] <DaveMethvin> trac does not seem to believe in a little thing i like to call referential integrity
[12:31:23] <DaveMethvin> i guess those are all just strings
[12:31:44] <DaveMethvin> what happens if I add them? lemme try
[12:31:53] * DaveMethvin prepares for trac meltdown
[12:32:32] <gnarf> yeah - got no clue what happened there
[12:32:56] <gnarf> and I totally forgot to do the backup this weekend too
[12:32:57] <gnarf> sigh
[12:34:40] <DaveMethvin> milestones are all there, versions are missing
[12:35:05] <gnarf> so are there any bugs you know of that were filed against say 1.6 ?
[12:35:17] <gnarf> can we look at the history of them
[12:35:32] <DaveMethvin> if you do a custom query the versions seem to be taken off the tickets so the list is long
[12:35:42] <gnarf> because the other thing is - if the version isn't used as a "version" in the report, then it doesn't exist
[12:36:08] <DaveMethvin> ah, ok well i added 1.6.3 and now that is coming up
[12:36:19] <DaveMethvin> so we could go back and patch those in?
[12:36:54] <DaveMethvin> the "versions" is supposed to have the release date but we can fake that to be relatively close
[12:37:03] <gnarf> well the versions may of never been set properly for when these things were reported
[12:37:17] <DaveMethvin> i've been setting the ones i've done, but that's just since 1.7
[12:37:34] <DaveMethvin> they're within an hour :D
[12:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: So what do you think we should do about 1.6.2 + effects?
[12:50:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if it really is just a bug in 1.6.2 - perhaps we just hide the problem by skipping that set of tests in the unit suite in failing browsers?
[12:51:01] <gnarf> either way, got an appt, bbiab - 1hr or so
[12:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[12:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you think we should switch to all lowercase selectors for widgets?
[12:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil pointed out that all native selectors are lowercase.
[12:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> We only ran into the problem with our tests where we had a camel-cased widget name.
[12:57:56] <jzaefferer> +1
[12:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll make the change.

[13:04:20] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: TOLOWERCASE NOT WORK GOOD!
[13:04:32] <timmywil> lol
[13:05:08] <timmywil> what's wrong?
[13:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing, I just changed UI to not create mixed-case selectors.
[13:06:34] <timmywil> oh good :)
[13:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> But the entire change was just adding .toLowerCase() so...
[13:06:58] <timmywil> ohnoes!

[18:31:45] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez ping
[18:36:42] <kborchers> ?tell scott_gonzalez i can't find your gisted diff with the todo's for menu. could you send me a link to that or push the branch to your repo?
[18:37:01] <kborchers> damn it bot-t
[19:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: It's a branch on my fork.
[19:24:10] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez which branch? i didn't see one that mentioned menu

[19:25:36] <kborchers> stupid github + hidden scroll bars = not seeing more branches
[19:25:45] <kborchers> thanks
[19:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[19:26:14] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: pushed :not/:has fix and ran unit/all.html against git locally. There are 20 fails, but they also occur with 1.7.2. Didn't check visual.
[19:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: You should run unit/all-active.html instead of unit/all.html so you can skip all the horribly broken test suites :-P
[19:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, I remove the spaces in the selector hours ago :-)
[19:27:31] <timmywil> oh, well, I added a test on core, so there
[19:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
