[05:36:58] <agcolom> Fantastic! Thanks! ;-)
[05:37:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: still needs a little work but it does it all in markdown already just needs a little clean up to organize things a delte ones we dont need
[05:37:37] <arschmitz> which will be manual but should make your life a lot easier
[05:37:46] <agcolom> just told Jasper that I've not done too much recently because my dad was taken to hospital while on holiday,... 
[05:37:58] <arschmitz> oh no is he doing ok?

[06:17:01] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I was looking at rxaviers his last overview in the Bower discussion
[06:17:26] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: why is jshint committed for UI but not for Mobile?
[06:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> Because jshint isn't even listed for Mobile.
[06:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> Do you run jshint in your unit tests?
[06:18:20] <arschmitz> for mobile its installed via npm
[06:18:34] <arschmitz> and is run as part of tests
[06:18:48] <scott_gonzalez> We run jshint as part of our QUnit tests.
[06:18:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:18:59] <arschmitz> so do we
[06:19:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: does jshint run if you run tests in browser?
[06:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[06:19:29] <arschmitz> for us it does not
[06:19:33] <arschmitz> so thats the difference
[06:19:43] <uGoMobi> yeah only phantomjs
[06:19:45] <arschmitz> for us it only runs when you run via command line
[06:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> Directly or via QUnit?
[06:20:07] <arschmitz> directly 
[06:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I thought.
[06:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why I said "We run jshint as part of our QUnit tests."
[06:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt jshint` uses npm installed jshint
[06:20:52] <arschmitz> yup
[06:20:56] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[06:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit uses soon-to-be-bower-installed jshint
[06:21:13] <arschmitz> right
[06:21:22] <arschmitz> i wonder if thats something we should considder changing
[06:21:29] <uGoMobi> I think we should
[06:21:48] <uGoMobi> do it the same way in both projects
[06:21:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> Make sure you skip jshint in QUnit when run inside TestSwarm.

[07:19:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we removed min-height from textarea from the CSS because we were going to set it with JS
[07:19:35] <arschmitz> right but when its hidden that does not work
[07:19:55] <uGoMobi> ah of course
[07:20:10] <uGoMobi> so we do have to set something in the CSS I think
[07:20:20] <uGoMobi> and override with inline style set with JS
[07:22:41] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:39:26] <gseguin> Good morning
[07:40:54] <gseguin> Why do you want a dependency on QUnit to lint the code?
[07:41:09] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:41:49] <gseguin> or did I misread?
[07:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> Because I want the barrier of entry for EVERYTHING to be as low as possible.
[07:43:55] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15robcaldecott opened issue #6366: Hiding first collapsible div on a page causes remaining content to shift up too far  02http://git.io/lX0z-Q
[07:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> "Did you run the tests?" -> Did you open /tests/unit/whatever in your browser?
[07:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> If yes, that's probably good enough.
[07:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> I do not ever want to say this to a new contributor: Did you install node, grunt, bower, phantom, run npm install, and then sit through a ten minute build and test process?
[07:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately, everyone things that file size and repo clone time is SOOO important.
[07:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> So just running tests will now require me to say half of that bullshit anyway.
[07:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm honestly not happy with this decision.
[07:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm tired of arguing about it.
[07:49:28] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: +1 here the barrier to contribution should be as low as possible
[07:49:58] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: often just understanding git enough to do a PR is a problem for some people
[07:50:29] <arschmitz> no need to make it any harder then it is already
[07:56:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: RE changelog i had an idea to easily catagorize issues the same way the commits are
[07:57:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how?
[07:57:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if we always make the first label the component effected i can use that infront of the issue title
[07:57:33] <arschmitz> so the same way we do collapsible: changed this ...
[07:57:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we should prefix the labels to make that work
[07:57:53] <arschmitz> prefix them?
[07:58:03] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:58:15] <uGoMobi> aren't the labels add in alphabetical order?
[07:58:23] <arschmitz> no
[07:58:35] <uGoMobi> so you would have to use something like _collapsible _popup etc
[07:58:56] * gseguin catches up
[07:59:24] <arschmitz> they are in the order you add them im i thoguht hmm let me test that 
[08:00:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nope your right
[08:00:24] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I'm not arguing yet ;)
[08:00:41] <arschmitz> we would have to prefix them
[08:00:46] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: just trying to follow the conversation and understand both sides
[08:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: My comment about arguing wasn't directed toward you. It was about the email thread.
[08:01:57] <gseguin> so you just want to add a jshint runner.html ?
[08:02:26] <gseguin> problem is that it will need to be maintained with the list of files
[08:02:47] <gseguin> or am I missing something?
[08:03:25] <gseguin> What I like about the grunt task is that it finds the files to lint by itself
[08:07:19] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ^
[08:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: No, don't add any new HTML files.
[08:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> JSHint runs as part of the widget tests.
[08:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/progressbar/progressbar.html
[08:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> First test.
[08:08:17] <gseguin> oh so for each unit test, you add a linting part
[08:09:16] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: but there is still a file list to maintain
[08:10:39] <scott_gonzalez> There's no file list.
[08:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's only linting the file being tested.
[08:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/progressbar/progressbar_common.js
[08:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> That one file with nothing but the name and defaults runs the first five tests.
[08:11:47] <gseguin> yeah I just took a look at unit/testsuite.js
[08:13:37] <gseguin> ok, I'm fine with the change but there are higher priority items for 1.4
[08:55:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah uGoMobi already filed an issue for that its just a general thing we would like to switch to not an issue for 1.4
[08:56:29] <arschmitz> gseguin: and RE pre release change log comment from last night i was talking about pre-release as in alpha / beta / RC not the actual pre postfix on the version in package.json 
[09:03:44] <gseguin> arschmitz: oh ok, I was missing context
[09:03:50] <gseguin> thanks for clarifying
[09:04:09] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah no problem i figured you had just misunderstood

[11:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: I'm aware that download builder will need changes when we split the files. Don't expect this to happen without preparation.
[11:39:39] <rxaviers> sure ok
[11:39:47] <rxaviers> I am asking just to think ahead
[11:40:05] <rxaviers> if you prefere to see first where decouplings are going first, np
[11:40:19] <rxaviers> s/first//g
[11:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.ui.effect.js will be split into many files.
[11:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> There will be multiple external dependencies that get added as options in download builder.
[11:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> But that's low priority.
[11:44:13] <rxaviers> ok
[12:15:11] <jzaefferer> arschmitz uGoMobi: what happened to the plan to provide a .ui-li-icon selector along with the img:first-child in ".ui-listview .ui-li-has-icon > img:first-child"?
[12:15:37] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: ui-li-thumb
[12:16:01] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: we deprecated ui-li-icon
[12:16:57] <uGoMobi> jzaefferer: so you can use ui-li-has-thumb on the li and ui-li-thumb on your element
[12:17:19] <uGoMobi> then override max-height/width if needed
[12:18:22] <jzaefferer> uGoMobi: Okay, I must be missing something
[12:18:23] <jzaefferer> thanks
[12:18:30] <uGoMobi> np
[12:36:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[12:36:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:36:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im inclined to close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5488 wont fix

[12:37:10] <arschmitz> if the one px they see us url bar its unavoidable with hiding turned on and can be fixed by turning hiding off 
[12:38:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I still want to give it a look
[12:39:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[12:39:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we can do something with CSS
[12:39:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: your welcome to try :)
[12:39:38] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[12:39:47] <uGoMobi> just because I agree it looks buggy
[12:39:57] <arschmitz> i have one thing i fixed it with before but id never do in lib
[12:40:08] <arschmitz> set whole page position fixed lol
[12:40:22] <arschmitz> then its "glued" to top ha ha 
[12:40:25] <uGoMobi> right
[12:40:27] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:40:56] <arschmitz> but anyway yes i agree it looks buggy but as we have seen url bar hiding is buggy :|
[12:41:25] <arschmitz> anyway just wanted your opinion on that ill leave it open 
[12:41:53] <arschmitz> oh so you never said what you thought about prefixed labels?
[12:42:10] <arschmitz> to categorize issues in change log
[12:43:14] <uGoMobi> that's fine by me
[12:43:27] <arschmitz> if we do this and are good about issue milestones and fixed labels along with commit message i think i could basicly fully automated changelog generation
[12:43:44] <arschmitz> even down to removing unwatned stuff and grouping it
[12:43:57] <uGoMobi> I just think we should first discuss commit messages, labels, etc in general
[12:44:08] <arschmitz> yeah i meant for 1.5
[12:44:11] <arschmitz> not 1.4
[12:45:45] <uGoMobi> let's discuss for 1.5 what final result we are looking for and then what is needed to accomplish it
[12:45:51] <uGoMobi> as much automated as possible
[12:46:30] <uGoMobi> if prefixing the labels helps with that, let's do it
[12:46:37] <arschmitz> cool
[12:47:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: tomorrow we should discuss what the plan is for going through issues for 1.4
[12:47:47] <arschmitz> the closed ones that is
[12:48:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, let's put that on the agenda
[12:49:22] <uGoMobi> github used to have advanced search page for a while, is that gone?
[12:49:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: um yes and no i think
[12:50:05] <arschmitz> its a kinda like super top search
[12:50:12] <arschmitz> that you can filter
[12:54:07] <uGoMobi> I can't search for "fixed" and filter by no milestone at the same time
[12:54:20] <arschmitz> yeah seems pretty useless
[12:54:46] <arschmitz> also i tried searching for "closed by" and get nothing useful 
[12:55:48] <uGoMobi> I was trying to just add &milestone=none but doesn't work
[12:55:55] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:58:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: milestone is not a valid param in github search api it looks like 
[12:59:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if this means that we have to go through hundreds of commits I think we should not do it
[12:59:16] <uGoMobi> it would cost so much time
[12:59:26] <arschmitz> i would not go through commits at all
[12:59:46] <uGoMobi> updating API docs has higher priority than having issue tickets in the changelog
[13:00:00] <arschmitz> agreed

[16:38:45] <_zoggy_> so just d/led lastest jqueryui, noticed in the js min there is an empty line between the heading comemnt and the actual js.
[16:39:09] <_zoggy_> also, in the .css, we are putting the browser specific stuff at the end of the item, like: min-height: 0; /* support: IE7 */
[16:39:26] <_zoggy_> but we have some stragglers that are on their own line, /* support: IE10, see #8844 */
[16:39:35] <_zoggy_> so you dont know which item it applies for
[16:47:17] <_zoggy_> then sometimes you put the reason out to the side...
[16:47:17] <_zoggy_> position: relative;/* position: relative prevents IE scroll bug (element with position: relative inside container with overflow: auto appear as "fixed") */
[16:54:19] <_zoggy_> also to note
[16:54:20] <_zoggy_> .ui-icon,
[16:54:20] <_zoggy_> .ui-widget-content .ui-icon {

[16:54:21] <_zoggy_> }
[16:54:27] <_zoggy_> why arent those combined?
[16:54:47] <_zoggy_> i guess its because they could be different.. and TR doesnt have the smarts to realize that they are the same?
