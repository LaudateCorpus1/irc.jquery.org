[05:18:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm reading http://blog.smartbear.com/software-quality/bid/280188/Using-jQuery-UI-to-Your-Advantage and so far it's not off to a good start.
[05:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> It uses jquery-latest.js and then mixes UI 1.10.2 with a 1.10.1 theme.
[05:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> Then it says that the reason you use a CDN is to reduce the number of domains that the user has to "allow".
[05:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? and he wants us to document the fact that native events like click still exist on our widgets?!?
[05:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> Aha, I think he's using a 1.10.1 theme because he's using base :-/
[05:26:25] <scott_gonzalez> "Only when everything else has failed will you need to delve into the documentation and the source code."
[05:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's hope nobody ever has to read the documentation unless it's a last resort...
[05:29:22] <tj_vantoll> He's using a 1.10.1 theme with 1.10.2 because the base "theme" went away in 1.10.2 :)
[05:29:33] <petersendidit> What is the reason that the tabs test cases don't run in grunt qunit?
[05:34:42] <tj_vantoll> Are you getting a PhantomJS error?
[05:54:57] <petersendidit> no they just don't run
[05:55:51] <petersendidit> looks like we don't run the dialog tabs and tooltip tests in PhantomJS
[05:56:05] <petersendidit> Line 321 in Gruntfile.js
[05:56:20] <petersendidit> Was wondering what the problem with the tabs were in PhantomJS?
[06:00:41] <tj_vantoll> Dunno.  I get this when I try to run the tests now even though I have PhantomJS installed locally:
[06:00:41] <tj_vantoll> Running PhantomJS...ERROR
[06:00:41] <tj_vantoll> >> In order for this task to work properly, PhantomJS must be installed locally

[06:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: We exclude tests that fail in Phantom but we can't figure out why.

[06:03:19] <petersendidit> is there a way to tell grunt qunit to only run one widgets tests?
[06:03:27] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...tabs seems to work now.
[06:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll check the others too.
[06:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> No, but we can probably add that.
[06:04:11] <petersendidit> Seems like a nice feature when you are working on a single widget alot
[06:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> I always just run in my browser :-P
[06:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> But I can see people using it.
[06:05:09] <petersendidit> yea I normaly just use the browser

[06:21:49] <petersendidit> do we want _classes to handle duplicate classes and not return dulplicates?
[06:22:02] <petersendidit> classes: {
[06:22:02] <petersendidit> 				"test": "class1 class2",
[06:22:02] <petersendidit> 				"test2": "class2 class3"
[06:22:02] <petersendidit> 			}
[06:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> It's fine to return duplicates.
[06:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> It should never result in a problem.
[06:24:54] <petersendidit> that was my thinking but wanted to confirm
[06:32:52] <petersendidit> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/790 should be fixed up now

[11:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: yeah
[11:38:12] <mikesherov> k, cool
[11:38:21] <mikesherov> also, swamy is broken?
[11:38:30] <mikesherov> Out of memory errors all over the place
[11:38:55] <mikesherov> I am 1 fix away from a successful Jenkins run, and now it's OOM?
[11:38:58] <mikesherov> NOOOOOO
[11:39:02] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:39:23] <mikesherov> gnarf: any idea what's up with Jenkins?
[11:40:11] <gnarf> mikesherov: i upgraded packages yesterday
[11:40:15] <gnarf> might be a new version issue?
[11:40:29] <mikesherov> so, zero builds have happened since a while
[11:41:05] <gnarf> if its >24 hours thats not it
[11:42:09] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI/lastFailedBuild/console
[11:42:09] <gnarf> bah
[11:42:11] <gnarf> memory issues
[11:42:22] <gnarf> fckin virtuozzo boxes
[11:43:14] <gnarf> also, fyi
[11:43:30] <gnarf> apparently /etc/init.d/jenkins stop never actually kills jenknis
[11:43:48] <gnarf> i think that might be the issue
[11:43:53] <gnarf> there were two jenkins running after the upgrade
[11:44:13] <gnarf> killed both, starting fresh
[11:44:18] <gnarf> care to test mikesherov?
[11:44:33] <mikesherov> OK
[11:44:38] <mikesherov> I need to push a change
[11:44:39] <mikesherov> nice
[11:44:41] <mikesherov> One sec
[11:45:25] <gnarf> im doing my best to conserve the last little bits of battery i have on this thing
