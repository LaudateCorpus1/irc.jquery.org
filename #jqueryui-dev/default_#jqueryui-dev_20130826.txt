[02:14:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping! Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6371: That's the point of the hidedividers extension - that is, to hide those dividers that have no "child" items.
[02:14:28] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6371 by robcaldecott (3d 23h ago): Listview with two adjacent dividers will not display correctly
[02:14:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The fact that the corners end up wrong is the bug.
[02:15:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I thought that was only for filterable
[02:15:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. I removed that code from filterable because it's widget-specific.
[02:15:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... to the listview widget.
[02:15:34] <uGoMobi> I understand
[02:15:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I also don't think it's a good idea to have it on by default, because the behaviour was not the default for 1.3.x.
[02:16:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so people have to set hidedividers to false if they want to add sub dividers
[02:16:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, the OP is abusing dividers, IMO.
[02:16:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: He should be using collapsibles or something.
[02:18:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: AFAIK a single <li> can have multiple lines of text, where the second line has smaller font than the first, right?
[02:18:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't realize it would affect dividers if you don't use filterable
[02:18:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can use headings and paragraphs inside the LI
[02:19:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so I think the OP has plenty of options instead of having to use successive dividers.
[02:20:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Filterable plays a role only insofar as to cause two dividers to be placed next to each other, at which point the hidedividers extension decides whether to hide one or not.
[02:20:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if the listview as originally provided already has adjacent dividers, then the hidedividers extension will act on those.
[02:20:45] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[02:21:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am ok with reverting the default back to false
[02:21:56] <uGoMobi> just have to document it for the filterable widget and might be good to comment on the ticket that I closed by the commit that changed the default to true
[02:22:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Me too. Still, we should tell the OP to not abuse the divider system like that but to use either collapsibles or multiple paragraphs instead.
[02:24:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... interesting ... maybe I should put a special case into the filterable widget.
[02:24:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean into the backcompat extension.
[02:24:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How's this: We turn off hidedividers, but in the filterable backcompat extension, I turn it back on for cases where the child widget is a listview.
[02:25:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that would be nice
[02:25:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, we document that from 1.5.0 onwards, you need to explicitly specify data-hidedividers="true" if you wish dividers to be auto-hidden.
[02:26:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, not sure how that would help https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6371 ... there, the OP wants it off.
[02:26:03] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6371 by robcaldecott (3d 23h ago): Listview with two adjacent dividers will not display correctly
[02:26:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we definitely need to fix the corners.
[02:26:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure if using two successive dividers is really abuse
[02:26:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It is, if the intention is to represent a nested list.
[02:27:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: semantically I would use nested list
[02:27:10] <uGoMobi> right
[02:27:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, because the OP says he uses it for a "sub-heading".
[02:27:52] <uGoMobi> oh ok, I thought sub-group
[02:27:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That means that his list is a list of sub-headings, where each sub-heading is a list on its own.
[02:28:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IOW, <ul><li><ul><li>
[02:29:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what if you have dividers and inject list items dynamically?
[02:29:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then I think we will also hide dividers (unless the option is set default) if you don't inject before pagecreate
[02:30:07] <uGoMobi> s/set default/set to false/
[02:31:02] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#732 (master - 2d42037 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build passed.

[02:32:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: hidedividers will correctly hide/show dividers at runtime if you call .listview( "refresh" )
[02:33:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We had an issue about providing a demo to illustrate an alternative to nested lists, right?
[02:33:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[02:36:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: having written https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6371#issuecomment-23252536 I'm beginning to think that we've dropped support for a part of HTML that's trivial to write, but very difficult to render nicely, but that we should come up with some framework-level way of handling nested lists, that's not disastrous.
[02:36:39] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #6371 by robcaldecott (3d 23h ago): Listview with two adjacent dividers will not display correctly
[02:38:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think we have to add some CSS for nested lists
[02:39:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on the other hand, there have also been request to make it possible to have nested list with bullets inside a LI
[02:40:29] <uGoMobi> so I am not sure yet if it should be a demo or in the library
[02:40:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if this can be solved with CSS alone, then it's easy either way.
[02:41:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if people want accordion-like behaviour, that's a different question.
[02:41:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you just removed the nested list example, right?
[02:41:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[02:41:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Feel free to revert locally so you can work on the CSS :)
[02:42:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, making collapsibles work with LI's is a new feature for a future release
[02:42:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see, so we will add UL to the list of elements that a collapsibleset is able to handle?
[02:42:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I am currently going through the demos, updating the CSS, reorganizing, updating content
[02:42:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I think that would be nice
[02:43:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Remember though that listview has /a lot/ of features, and we should try to avoid duplicating those on accordions ...
[02:43:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I added this to the 1.4-changelog "Deprecated" section: Deprecated auto-hiding of dividers. As of 1.5.0 you must add data-hidedividers="true" to a listview in order for dividers to be automatically hidden when all the items in the section they designate are hidden/removed.
[02:44:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok thanks
[02:45:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you gonna make the backcompat js override the default for 1.4?
[02:45:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess autohide worked only with filterable in 1.3.x, so it was off by default anyway.

[05:46:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: morning
[05:46:34] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:57:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: RE: nested listviews
[05:58:09] <arschmitz> there are a bunch of good ways to handle them with out any thing special
[05:58:12] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/262/edit
[05:58:32] <arschmitz> only thing at all custom there is 3 lines of css
[05:59:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, so maybe we should not do anything with them in the library
[05:59:33] <arschmitz> yeah i mean you could add those classes to make it easy but thats as far as i would go
[05:59:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just some demos; CSS and how you can dynamically create pages for nested lists
[06:00:21] <arschmitz> basicly most of the css there is just overiding margins and padding
[06:00:31] <arschmitz> i take that back not most all
[06:02:17] <uGoMobi> I think that people would still customize to their own taste so I don't think we have to add classes to the library
[06:02:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:03:49] <arschmitz> anyway point being its still super easy to do nested listviews that look good
[06:05:07] <arschmitz> so no changes on our part are required
[06:09:16] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz closed issue #6394: Dynamically setting the Toolbar to a "fixed" Mode doesn't work anymore with 1.4  02http://git.io/LG1fEw

[06:14:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah sure, but better to wait a moment

[06:40:57] <arschmitz> something relativly imporant we should have very brief discussion about if possible
[06:41:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[06:41:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its just about the name of the content widget
[06:41:33] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:42:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its still undocumented and EVERYONE (including john bender )  seems to agree its terrible
[06:42:42] <uGoMobi> right, let's discuss
[06:42:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also conflicts with data-role="content"
[06:43:05] <uGoMobi> true
[06:43:11] <arschmitz> but yea _|Nix|_ and i have discussed this several times already and want to change
[06:43:34] <arschmitz> but i think we need to make a final decision and change right now before beta and before anything is documented
[06:43:49] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:43:58] <uGoMobi> are there suggestions already?
[06:44:05] <arschmitz> my suggestion is pagecontainer
[06:44:18] <arschmitz> to replace old deprecated pageContainer
[06:44:45] <uGoMobi> is just "container" already considered?
[06:45:32] <arschmitz> it was discussed
[06:45:40] <jquicommit> [13jquery-ui] 15pereorga opened pull request #1064: Demos/tests: Losslessly recompress PNG/GIF images. (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/G1xAgQ
[06:45:45] <arschmitz> but i think its kinda vague
[06:46:15] <arschmitz> lots of things are containers
[06:46:49] <arschmitz> this is very specificly a page container its sole responsibility is managing pages
[06:47:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5427
[06:47:37] <b-ot> uGoMobi: Issue #5427 by johnbender (7mon 2w ago): Navigation Refactor - Content Container Widget
[06:47:59] <uGoMobi> that confused me a bit
[06:48:17] <arschmitz> lol yes john changed it himself a couple times
[06:48:24] <arschmitz> because he was not happy with the name
[06:48:54] <arschmitz> and one of the last things he discussed with _|Nix|_ and i in portland was about that he still like the name
[06:49:20] <uGoMobi> any chance that it will be used for things other than pages in the future?
[06:49:30] <arschmitz> i would not think so
[06:50:40] <gseguin> mornin'
[06:50:44] <uGoMobi> ok then let's go for pagecontainer
[06:50:47] <gseguin> arschmitz: 'sup?
[06:50:49] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[06:51:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: great that you landed all that icon CSS stuff, thanks!
[06:51:33] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you're welcome
[06:51:41] <gseguin> hopefully it works as expected
[06:51:42] <arschmitz> gseguin: kinda mulling over the name of the current "Content" widget
[06:52:17] <arschmitz> john bender _|Nix|_ scott_gonzalez and i have all been in agreement it needs to change to something other then content
[06:52:29] <arschmitz> and its not yet documented in anyway so nows the time to do it
[06:52:39] <gseguin> and it's still readable
[06:53:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: my current suggestion is pagecontainer
[06:53:18] <arschmitz> since it replaces $.mobile.pageContainer
[06:53:52] <arschmitz> and a page container is exactly what it is. 
[06:54:09] <gseguin> then it sounds like a reasonable name
[06:54:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: i just wanted to run by you _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi before i made any changes
[06:55:06] <arschmitz> gseguin: cool i think thats good enough then uGoMobi, you, scott_gonzalez, and i all agree
[06:55:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: think thats good enough to get started on this? i dont think _|Nix|_ will have any issue
[06:56:29] <gseguin> arschmitz: where does this widget live?
[06:56:46] <arschmitz> gseguin: its in jquery.mobile.navigation.js
[06:56:49] <arschmitz> it needs to move
[06:57:05] <arschmitz> but thats where john did it and i have not had a chance to pull it out yet
[06:58:21] <gseguin> arschmitz: and you're sure the only purpose is being a pageContainer
[06:58:33] * gseguin has not looked at it in details
[06:58:54] <arschmitz> gseguin: yes load page change page etc are its public methods
[06:59:11] <gseguin> ok
[06:59:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: its basicly an independant nav container
[06:59:25] <arschmitz> to handle pages within 
[06:59:35] <arschmitz> so that now you could have like 3 page containers
[06:59:41] <arschmitz> that all have independant navigation
[07:00:00] <gseguin> gotcha
[07:00:35] <arschmitz> so instead of like $.mobile.changepage("/foo.html") you now do $("#containerID").pagecontainer("change","/foo.html")
[07:01:10] <arschmitz> gseguin: it also handles the transitions
[07:01:12] <gseguin> makes sense
[07:01:38] <arschmitz> yeah thats why i think pagecontainer makes sense its exactly what it is 
[07:03:57] <arschmitz> gseguin: not now but maybe in next version i think some of the page events should be changed to pageContainer events too
[07:04:08] <arschmitz> like all the ones that do not trigger on the specific page
[07:04:25] <arschmitz> they should trigger on the container and be normal widget events 
[07:04:46] <arschmitz> and the "page" ones should be triggered by the page widget
[07:05:18] <arschmitz> gseguin: but anyway thats for another time

[08:17:09] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so are we releasing today ?
[08:17:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: nope
[08:17:33] <uGoMobi> was about to bring that up
[08:17:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ ^^^
[08:17:55] <gseguin> what are we waiting on?
[08:18:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok whats the new plan?
[08:18:10] <uGoMobi> I think we need a few more days to fix some of the bugs that have been reported the last days
[08:18:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok
[08:18:46] <uGoMobi> but also, we need to provide documentation
[08:18:57] <uGoMobi> if we want people to really test the beta
[08:19:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok 
[08:19:34] <uGoMobi> I am working on updating the demos and an upgrade guide, but this is very time consuming :/
[08:19:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz reopened issue #6394: Dynamically setting the Toolbar to a "fixed" Mode doesn't work anymore with 1.4  02http://git.io/LG1fEw
[08:19:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im sure 
[08:20:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i plan on doing some demo work this week
[08:20:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[08:20:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have 3 1.4 issues assigned to my self right now im working on fixing. 2 are simple one well im still working lol
[08:21:05] <arschmitz> so i am going to hopefully fix those today
[08:21:10] <arschmitz> then ill jump into the demos
[08:24:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What are we releasing? Beta?
[08:25:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes beta 1
[08:25:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Go for it!
[08:25:46] <uGoMobi> not yet
[08:27:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just wanted to run a change by you real quick
[08:29:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lay it on me!
[08:29:56] <arschmitz> content widget
[08:30:01] <arschmitz> rename pagecontainer
[08:30:11] <arschmitz> we talked about tons of names before
[08:30:17] <arschmitz> but i think this makes the most sense
[08:30:34] <arschmitz> and right now is our last chance to do it before its documented
[08:30:42] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[08:31:16] <_|Nix|_> I guess pagecontainer is in line with $.mobile.pageContainer, which is where the only thing resembling a page container resides.
[08:31:19] <arschmitz> keeps consistancy with the fact that it essentially replaces $.mobile.pagecontainer
[08:31:26] <arschmitz> exactly
[08:31:29] <_|Nix|_> Bam!
[08:31:36] <_|Nix|_> Constructive interference :)
[08:31:37] <arschmitz> and it describes with out any question what it is and does
[08:32:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... except that it will eventually contain things other than pages as well.
[08:32:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hows so like what?
[08:32:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like a pane on a large document that is individually navigable. Think email app left/right pane.
[08:32:48] <arschmitz> right thats still a page
[08:32:58] <arschmitz> it will still contain a div data-role="page"
[08:33:04] <arschmitz> which is what will navigate 
[08:33:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. Good. As they say on bugzilla: WORKSFORME.
[08:33:19] <arschmitz> lol
[08:33:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok just wanted to make sure everyone was ok with the change
[08:33:46] <_|Nix|_> +1
[08:33:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because i think content as a name was universally disliked
[08:35:10] <_|Nix|_> Alright. Sounds like a plan.
[08:35:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool thanks
[08:35:26] <_|Nix|_> I've already made my way through button.xml and checkboxradio.xml in the API docs.
[08:35:26] <gseguin> arschmitz: navigationcontainer could work as well?
[08:35:35] <gseguin> or not
[08:35:40] <arschmitz> gseguin: it would work
[08:35:43] <gseguin> naming is hard
[08:35:44] <_|Nix|_> navtainer, folks, navtainer™
[08:36:13] <arschmitz> gseguin: and is apt as well i just thought page container because its shorter and is consistant with what it replaces
[08:36:16] <gseguin> he btw looks like johnbender is online
[08:39:05] <_|Nix|_> I'll BBL.

[11:46:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so did a little more work on nested listview demo
[11:47:01] <arschmitz> added 2 more ways to do them including one that Exactly replaces old ones and just uses a single event binding 
[11:47:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh that's great
[11:48:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/273/edit
[11:50:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: have one more variation in mind i want to add
[11:50:21] <arschmitz> but this should address all the different ways you would want to use them
[11:51:39] <uGoMobi> nice
[11:54:27] <uGoMobi> dynamic page solution looks neat

[12:27:40] <krasslex> hello
[12:28:38] <gseguin> hi krasslex
[12:29:39] <krasslex> do you know, that the hovered menue item in the menue-widget has about 1px less height than the non hovered?
[12:32:34] <krasslex> http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[12:32:45] <krasslex> tested with ie and ff
[12:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> krasslex: I don't see any difference.
[12:34:42] <scott_gonzalez> Are you zooming?
[12:36:11] <krasslex> i.e. if i put the mouse over "Ada", all items below jump up 1px and the whole menue becomes 1px less height
[12:36:26] <krasslex> no, ctrl+0 -> no zoom
[12:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see it happening at the normal zoom level.
[12:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> This is surely sub-pixel rendering BS though.
[12:37:08] <kborchers> that should not happen and i don't see it either
[12:37:18] <krasslex> ok
[12:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Try at different zoom levels.
[12:37:31] <gseguin> don't see it except when zoomed in
[12:37:41] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah at zoom i'm sure it's all messed up
[12:37:45] <kborchers> but at 100% it should be fine
[12:37:57] <krasslex> maybe it is a problem on my sytem
[12:38:26] <krasslex> if i do ctrl+0 in ie the zoom-level is 125%
[12:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> umm...
[12:38:36] <kborchers> o_O
[12:38:49] <kborchers> i think we found the problem :P
[12:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> Well, a problem :-P
[12:39:10] <kborchers> :)
[12:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> I hate that things break when zoomed.
[12:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's amazing the web works at all.
[12:39:34] <krasslex> sorry, than it is my mistake
[12:40:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: btw, i saw your feedback on that pr, i will address that tonight and keep going down the list of menu bugs (needed a break from PointerEvents as my head is just blocked on that in IE7 right now)
[12:41:00] <krasslex> does anyone know, what "normal Zoom" in FF does refer to?
[12:41:16] <krasslex> obviously it's not 100%
[12:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> Normal is always 100%.
[12:42:07] <kborchers> wait, what? a "normal" zoom level anywhere is 100%
[12:43:19] <krasslex> maybe it is a system or browser option
[12:44:05] <krasslex> i have to zoom out twice from "normal Zoom", to avoid the "jumping menue"
[12:44:56] <gseguin> krasslex: system's accessibility options?
[12:45:09] <kborchers> i haven't looked but yeah i'm sure for accessibility you can set the default to a different level … i think i have also noticed in chrome at least that if you zoom on a site then come back to it later, it zooms in again
[12:57:01] <krasslex> thx, found the accessibility option
[12:58:46] <krasslex> but may be my website-visitors don't?
[13:01:36] <krasslex> ok, thx for the help
[13:01:39] <krasslex> gby
[13:28:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[13:29:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[13:29:13] <arschmitz> i left comments on your doc
[13:29:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[13:31:45] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, what do you guys think this mean? "A" Milliseconds in day [link below]. I understood it's the elapsed milliseconds since midnight. Eg: `date.getTime() - dateWithHourMinsSecsMillisecsTruncatedToZero.getTime()`, still needing to handle timezone...
[13:31:47] <rxaviers> http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table
[13:32:34] <rxaviers> Does it make sense? Im trying to find a better definition on the docs...
[13:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's how it reads to me.
[13:41:51] <rxaviers> ;) thanks

[21:45:20] <hbcreative> hello all, anyone around?
[22:51:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[22:51:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: morning
[22:52:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! In working on that nested listview demo I came across a few CSS rules that affect nested list items.
[22:52:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the listview css we do a lot of .ui-listview li or .ui-listview .ui-li-static
[22:53:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This has the disadvantage that it will also apply to <ul><li><ul><li id="will-apply-to-this">
[22:53:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I guess we can change to .ui-listview >ul > li and .ui-listview >ul > .ui-li-static
[22:53:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can that be considered a bug such that it needs to be fixed by using more > in the CSS?
[22:54:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Should I make an issue?
[22:55:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure
[22:55:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[22:55:55] <uGoMobi> thanks
[22:58:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should I milestone it for 1.4.0?
[22:58:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[22:59:05] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6397: Listview CSS: Some rules inadvertently apply to list items of nested listviews  02http://git.io/-SzwWw
[22:59:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: want to land nested listview demos in 1.4 too
[22:59:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and I guess the library should support them as much as possible.
[23:00:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
