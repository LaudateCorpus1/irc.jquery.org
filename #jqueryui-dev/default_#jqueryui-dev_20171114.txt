[06:56:50] <Rouless> Hi, anyone can help me with some jquery? I'm doing a masonry grid with css (using relative and absolute, with column counts) and as i have the problem that the parent div has less height than the child (who has an img), I've tried to fix it with some jquery:
[06:56:50] <Rouless> $(window).load(function() {
[06:56:50] <Rouless> $('.item').css('height', $('.item img').css('height'))
[06:56:50] <Rouless> });
[06:56:50] <Rouless> but the problem is that all items have the same height than the first item (or first image), how can i do to apply this for each img, and not apply the height of the first image?
