[07:55:34] <januschh> Hey, sorry to disturb you, but I have not found any other convenient way to get in touch.
[07:56:20] <januschh> I am just wondering on how to get the latest or latest stable release of jquery-ui in UMD format or commonjs through npm?
[08:10:02] <januschh> I cannot find any updated version. The one I am currently using is through "npm install jquery-ui" that gives me 10.5 which is starting to be a little buggy, maybe because I use jquery 2.1.4?
[08:10:48] <januschh> How do you install 1.12 through npm?
[08:11:30] <januschh> npm install git+https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui.git  installs something but it sadly does not contain jquery-ui
[08:11:46] <januschh> How do you guys go about it @all?

[08:47:57] <januschh> Why do you have a package.json in the repo?
[09:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you work on this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5320
[09:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Another ticket for the button rewrite: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8596
[09:13:35] <januschh> @scott_gonzalez Hey, is it possible to get a 1.11 or 1.12 through npm? Or does one have to use the download builder? Id like to require just the jquery-ui modules that I need. Currently I only find 10.5 on npm. Would appreciate your reply!
[09:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> januschh: We've never had control of the npm package.
[09:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> But we just became owners the other day. When 1.12.0 is released, it'll be on npm.
[09:26:27] <januschh> scott_gonzales: weee, that is good news!!! I tried to contact the person who own jquery-ui on npm if he could update it, but he didn't reply :(
[09:29:59] <januschh> scott_gonzales: Is 1.12-pre stable enough to replace 10.5? there is a nasty bug when using .tooltip in newer chrome version.
[09:30:43] <januschh> scott_gonzales: This is what the chrome console says: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'complete' of true
[09:30:55] <januschh> scott_gonzales: Have you experienced that before?
[09:32:01] <januschh> scott_gonzales: Here is the stack trace: $.each.$.Widget.(anonymous function) @ widget.js:503_open @ tooltip.js:275(anonymous function) @ widget.js:98_updateContent @ tooltip.js:215(anonymous function) @ widget.js:98open @ tooltip.js:182(anonymous function) @ widget.js:98handlerProxy @ widget.js:399jQuery.event.dispatch @ jquery.js:4430jQuery.event
[09:32:01] <januschh> .add.elemData.handle @ jquery.js:4116
[09:32:20] <januschh> In jqueryui 10.5
[11:51:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: are we 1.7 minimum yet?
[11:52:02] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: or do i need to detect?
[11:52:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also sure - I'll take a look at solving it this weekend - remind me?
[11:52:20] <gnarf> When do you get to NYC?
[11:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We're 1.7 minimum.
[11:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> I get in around 9:00p tomorrow.
[11:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> januschh: I'm not sure what version you're actually using, but there is no v1.10.5.
[11:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> If you're asking if master is stable, yes.
[11:56:59] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're going from 1.10.x to 1.12.x, you'll have two versions of upgrades to go through.

[11:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> Also note that the button rewrite is not yet in master, but will be VERY soon.

[14:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> Scrollable autocomplete seems to have broken in IE.
[14:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...doesn't even with with 1.11.0 or 1.10.0.
[14:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing it just never worked in IE 10.
[15:08:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what do you think the chances are that our "builder" (grunt wordpress stuff + download builder (ui) + amd builder (mobile) (cc arschmitz) will run on node 4?
[15:09:09] <gnarf> I'm working on a stage environment for it right now
[15:09:16] <arschmitz> 0
[15:09:16] <gnarf> should I try to set it up with node 4 and see what breaks?
[15:09:26] <arschmitz> i know 100% mobile does not
[15:09:28] <gnarf> it's on 0.10 right now
[15:09:34] <gnarf> what about 0.12 ?
[15:09:39] <arschmitz> maybe
[15:09:39] <gnarf> arschmitz :/
[15:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> The module we've had the most trouble with is syslog.
[15:09:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no longer a problem
[15:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't tried it with node 4  yet.
[15:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:10:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ignore syslog
[15:10:14] <gnarf> lets port to something like "debug"
[15:10:34] <gnarf> my new way of starting node apps on the server auto-logs the stdout stderr to syslog
[15:11:09] <gnarf> so the syslog issues we had in the past we don't really need to think much about anymore
[15:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so you want to switch to debug and then just run with DEBUG=*?
[15:11:15] <gnarf> the new node-notifier-server doesn't use em
[15:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> Or perhaps custom debug flags per app.
[15:11:31] <arschmitz> gnarf: jquery mobile it self cant built on node 4 execpt for latest 
[15:11:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah (though I used an optimist flag in notifier-server)
[15:12:04] <arschmitz> so nothing that expects any current version of jquery mobile to build will work
[15:12:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/gnarf/node-notifier-server/blob/master/notifier-server.js#L29-L31
[15:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> Are you injecting the process id when you pipe to syslog?
[15:12:36] <gnarf> arschmitz: do you know about 0.12 yet? or are we skipping?
[15:12:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm not doing the piping -- systemd is
[15:12:47] <gnarf> it's awesome
[15:13:11] <arschmitz> gnarf: i dont know about 12 i wont be able to check until later im in the middle of somthing
[15:13:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/search?q=search%20source%3D%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fsyslog%20notifier-server&sid=1444849995.3035302&earliest=&latest=
[15:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's certainly something we can look into during the summit.
[15:13:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: note that even the cloudbot (b-ot) is logging it's output to our syslogs ;)
[15:14:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/search?q=search%20source%3D%2Fvar%2Flog%2Fsyslog%20notifier-server%20host%3Dcontrol&earliest=&latest=&sid=1444850065.3035327 <-- thats the ansible deploy logs
[15:14:50] <gnarf> using DEBUG
[15:14:52] <scott_gonzalez> node-wordpress, gilded-wordpress, and grunt-wordpress should all work fine in 4. 
[15:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test deploying jquery.com right now.
[15:15:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: try with api
[15:15:59] <gnarf> im worried about the xml stuffs 
[15:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com works fine.
[15:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that should be fine.
[15:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> That all goes through external binaries.
[15:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> But I'll test right now.
[15:16:20] <gnarf> ok
[15:16:36] <gnarf> so maybe we put amdbuilder on a old node box
[15:16:41] <gnarf> or nave / nvm it?
[15:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> We can dig in this weekend, probably isn't too hard to update.
[15:17:15] <gnarf> i'm a little worried about the download.jqueryui.com stuff too
[15:17:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah I'll have a stage for us to play on 
[15:17:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, Rafael will be at the summit.
[15:17:52] <scott_gonzalez> So he can help dig up any issues.
[15:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> api.jqueryui.com just deployed fine with 4.
[15:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I've been planning on digging into download.jqueryui.com for a long time.
[15:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> Once we have 1.12.0 out, I'll have time to dig in.
[15:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> Are you in a rush to upgrade to 4?
[15:21:09] <gnarf> not really - i just want to know what version I should set this new stage at
[15:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:21:20] <gnarf> if we think it will work on 4 - lets just run 4 on stage
[15:21:23] <gnarf> until we can get it working
[15:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> Well, hopefully we can resolve any issues that do exist this weekend.
[15:21:27] <gnarf> and i can run 0.10 on live
[15:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Which repos specifically do you know that don't work on 4?
[15:21:54] <arschmitz> jquery-mobile
[15:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:22:15] <arschmitz> its easy to fix
[15:22:25] <arschmitz> i just need to land m_gol patch 
[15:22:30] <arschmitz> the hard part is old versions
[15:22:31] <gnarf> but will that break building old versions?
[15:22:42] <gnarf> i mean - its just build not include right?
[15:22:44] <arschmitz> gnarf: thats exactly the problem
[15:23:03] <gnarf> so it doesnt actually need to >include< the module, just amdify it?
[15:24:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, phantom is going to be a pain point for many projects.
[15:24:32] <arschmitz> gnarf: the problem is we use jsdom in the build for all the older versions
[15:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously, how is this not a solved problem yet?
[15:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> Why is Google not just building a better headless browser for us?
[15:24:55] <arschmitz> in the latest version we no longer use jsdom
[15:26:24] <arschmitz> gnarf: https://github.com/brianmcd/contextify/issues/177 is the problem
[15:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm heading out to the orthopedist. Just leave me a message if you need me to work on anything.
[22:16:52] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: regarding upgrade guide, I've button related items to that already. See last commit on https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/pull/123 -> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/commit/0219897751a35af9ce9bc5febdc10a34e7c24a94
[22:17:37] <arschmitz> oh awesome i guess i have not checked in a bit i do remember you asking me to now though :-/
[22:17:42] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sorry about that
