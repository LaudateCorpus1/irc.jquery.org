[06:14:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: Ping!
[06:26:31] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: pong
[06:27:05] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: do you have that link you wanted me to comment on i lost it out of my backscroll before i got to it
[06:31:00] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: sure. Here you go: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Datepicker
[06:31:05] <arschmitz> thank you
[07:13:06] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: I just requested access to comment not sure who approves that?
[07:56:17] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: approved
[08:35:33] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i commented about the inline option i would like to see will probably try to add some more mobile specific stuff as well 
[08:40:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: estoy aqui
[08:40:40] <arschmitz> johnbender: Hi, get your starwars fix in last night?
[08:43:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: no I watched some MIT courseware on linear algebra o.o
[08:43:26] <arschmitz> Even better!
[08:43:30] <johnbender> I need a refresher and I have linear algebra stuck in my head
[08:43:43] <johnbender> arschmitz: what did you want to chat about?
[08:44:20] <arschmitz> ok so we talked about one of the things that needs to be added to containers is some way to route them and maintain state based on url
[08:45:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and i talked about this the last day in portland and think we came up with a sensible way to handle it
[08:46:39] <arschmitz> on inital load of a url with no hash it just loads whatever is in the containers
[08:46:49] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: thanks
[08:47:44] <arschmitz> when a container is navigated it will add a hash something to effect of &ui-container-(containerid)=/foo/bar.html
[08:48:36] <arschmitz> that way a history entry is created and when the page is refreshed that can be parsed and that container can load the correct content
[08:49:13] <arschmitz> basicly the same way things work now when its hash only 
[08:49:26] <arschmitz> but for multiple containers
[08:52:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: does that seem reasonable with your current implementation of containers?
[08:54:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmmm
[08:54:39] <johnbender> arschmitz: so that was the alternate solution that I proposed when we talked about this originally
[08:55:02] <johnbender> but we know from previous work that maintaining ui states is sort of horrible
[08:55:25] <johnbender> and in general I think it's a bad idea to add extra stuff onto urls that users specify
[08:56:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: part of me wonders if we shouldn't just wait and live with the single canonical container for a while before starting down that road
[08:57:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: it would be REALLY nice to let the representatio of the content at the url that's been loaded dictate the content of the various containers
[08:57:36] <johnbender> that way the URL is always accurate
[08:58:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: the implementation details of *what* delegates said content to each container is complex
[08:58:45] <johnbender> but I think attempting to solve the problem without additional url manipulation will be a better solution for users
[08:59:06] <johnbender> ie, less confusing
[08:59:30] <arschmitz> johnbender: so how would you specify if a container has been navigated for a refresh with multiple containers?
[08:59:36] <arschmitz> with out manipulation 
[08:59:49] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm
[09:00:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: so why would a refresh be a navigation event?
[09:00:19] <johnbender> other than a literal browser refresh
[09:00:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: thinking out loud
[09:00:41] <johnbender> so I maybe be saying things you've already thought through
[09:00:48] <arschmitz> basicly my thought is you have a basic 2 container layout
[09:00:55] <arschmitz> you navigate one container
[09:00:59] <arschmitz> then refrsh browser
[09:01:17] <arschmitz> how do you make sure the container that was navigated loads the correct url
[09:01:36] <johnbender> so with the scheme I'm talking about two things would happen there
[09:01:37] <johnbender> 1.
[09:01:46] <johnbender> in the orignal navigation taht changed one container
[09:02:02] <johnbender> the url would have been changed and new content loaded from the server that only altered one of the containers
[09:02:38] <johnbender> 2. the refresh button would then be hit, and the same url would be loaded and jqm would reconstitute the two containers in the same way it did for the previous navigation event
[09:03:17] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok but in what way will the url be changed to only reflect the change of one container?
[09:03:30] <arschmitz> and not a whole new page
[09:03:39] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm
[09:03:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: lets consider an example
[09:03:59] <johnbender> maybe the mail app
[09:03:59] <johnbender> ?
[09:04:04] <arschmitz> sure
[09:04:46] <johnbender> lets say we're building it in a weird way to simulate what you're talking about
[09:04:52] <johnbender> so, when you select a new folder
[09:05:04] <johnbender> it *doesn't* alter the email pane
[09:05:09] <johnbender> that is the last of the three panes
[09:05:15] <arschmitz> ok
[09:05:22] <johnbender> so if you were looking at an email it would just stay there until you selected another email
[09:05:34] <arschmitz> right
[09:05:34] <johnbender> routes would look like
[09:05:57] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: at our UI meeting in Portland, someone brought up the idea to build on top of topcoat: http://topcoat.io/ - do you know anything about that framework? Maybe johnbender does? It would be great to have someone with theming expertise to check that out and see if we can replace UI or Mobile themes with that.
[09:06:11] <jzaefferer> or rather, offer an alternative, not a replacement
[09:06:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: uGoMobi maybe?
[09:06:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: would be the best from a css perspective
[09:06:41] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I know alex is in touch with those folks if we want to talk with them, and I have a direct contact with them too
[09:06:47] <johnbender> jzaefferer: even if we just want to ask questions
[09:06:55] <johnbender> non-committal
[09:07:47] <arschmitz> from a technical perspective of looking at the markup and css i think uGoMobi would be best hes on vacation right now but will be back next week
[09:08:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: so if you just wanted to alter the folder pane in this case maybe the url is /folder/x/ and not /folder/x/email/y
[09:08:27] <johnbender> (using rails conventions just for the sake of argument) 
[09:09:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: when /folder/x/ is rendered there's no information about the email list or single email pane and JQM does nothing with them
[09:09:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: i had thought of that i just was not sure about how people would feel about enforcing a directory structure to their urls 
[09:09:24] <jzaefferer> arschmitz johnbender: okay, thanks. What's the best way to keep track of this so that he can take a look when he's back? Also, what's uGoMobi name? I'm still trying to map the Mobile team in my head to people I met at in-person meetings
[09:09:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: no need to be directory structured
[09:09:35] <johnbender> jzaefferer: issue in the tracker
[09:09:40] <johnbender> definitely 
[09:09:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: jasper
[09:09:54] <arschmitz> i mean jzaefferer
[09:09:58] <johnbender> jzaefferer: just keep it vague so people don't react weird
[09:10:16] <jzaefferer> ah, that's jasper
[09:10:27] <jzaefferer> maybe we can get him to switch to real name in irc ;)
[09:10:34] <johnbender> arschmitz: it could be /foo?folder=x&email=y
[09:10:54] <johnbender> as long as the representation is unique
[09:11:03] <johnbender> on some level
[09:11:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok so same idea as hash in that example just not using hash
[09:11:20] <johnbender> the only thing they have to commit to is supplying the right information at the right url
[09:11:23] <arschmitz> using query params instead
[09:11:31] <johnbender> arschmitz: no
[09:11:35] <johnbender> well
[09:11:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's the same idea except that if you care about urls
[09:11:53] <johnbender> and you care about progressive enhancement
[09:11:58] <johnbender> the content will always be available
[09:12:27] <jzaefferer> johnbender: like this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6110
[09:12:29] <johnbender> going to /folder/x should produce information about the folder with an identity of x in your application
[09:12:39] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15jzaefferer opened issue #6110: Using topcoat as alterantive theme?  02http://git.io/VoqvsA
[09:12:43] <johnbender> jzaefferer: perfect
[09:12:59] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks for keeping that ball up in the air :)
[09:13:22] <johnbender> arschmitz: and when you create links in your application you're just linking to the content you want to laod
[09:13:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: and with a bit of extra structure jqm can put it in the right place
[09:13:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok i got you
[09:13:55] <jzaefferer> now with less typos
[09:14:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: :)
[09:14:14] <arschmitz> so basicly maintain the same idea as most backend mvc stuff does already
[09:14:27] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I always reread after I post. Every time. Always horrible.
[09:14:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: not sure what you mean?
[09:15:19] <arschmitz> where the url is actually just a set of key value pairs to load the correct content
[09:16:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: well it can be anything really
[09:16:31] <johnbender> as long as the backend plays along
[09:16:36] <arschmitz> right
[09:16:53] <johnbender>  /foo?something=<insert sha hash>
[09:17:06] <johnbender> as long as the backend can produce the right resource with the right structure we don't really care
[09:17:13] <arschmitz> right
[09:17:51] <johnbender> if people want to do something silly like hit the same url over and over then they need to do the work of appending something to it
[09:18:04] <johnbender> so that we can get a change event
[09:18:16] <johnbender> on second thought that's not silly at all
[09:18:31] <johnbender> but it's something that needs to be dealt with
[09:18:39] <johnbender> not necessarily on our side
[09:19:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: so in our example mail app a url might look like /mail/folder/foldername/mail/mailid/ or /mail?folder=foldername&mail=mailid
[09:19:19] <johnbender> ancillary to our discussion
[09:19:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah it could honestly be anything
[09:19:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: literally anything at all
[09:19:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: but if they were just going to load a new email in the email pane it might just be /email/mailid 
[09:20:11] <johnbender> as long as when the content comes back it can be associated with a given pane and it doesn't have content for the other panes unless it's necessary
[09:20:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: right!
[09:20:22] <arschmitz> right
[09:20:25] <johnbender> and that's totally reasonable
[09:20:28] <johnbender> just pull the email
[09:20:37] <johnbender> and make sure it's targetted at the right pane
[09:20:44] <johnbender> framework does the rest
[09:20:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: there's some thought that needs to be put in to the targetting
[09:21:02] <arschmitz> yeah and targeting the right frame would just be a data- attribute
[09:21:06] <johnbender> right
[09:21:15] <johnbender> but it would be nice to keep that minimal
[09:21:24] <johnbender> or
[09:21:33] <johnbender> more importantly consistent with the initial page load
[09:21:55] <johnbender> ie, it should be in the same container element that's in the original page load
[09:22:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok so how do we know how to modify the url properly for when they are loading just a single panes content
[09:22:34] <johnbender> arschmitz: what do you mean?
[09:22:41] <johnbender> example?
[09:22:55] <arschmitz> ok so inital load is just /mail/
[09:23:01] <arschmitz> that loads all three panes
[09:23:26] <arschmitz> then they navigate just the folder pane /mail/folder/newfolder
[09:23:45] <arschmitz> then they navigate the email pane /mail/email/mailid
[09:24:27] <arschmitz> we would not want to update the url to /mail/email/mailid because then we have no idea about folder
[09:25:05] <arschmitz> we would need something like /mail/folder/newfolder/email/mailid
[09:25:16] <johnbender> we don't need to know about the folder, the links in the folder view know about the folders right?
[09:25:31] <johnbender> arschmitz: as long as the server knows what to do we don't care
[09:25:54] <johnbender> it's certainly easier for the server to make a determination about content with /folder/x/email/y
[09:25:55] <arschmitz> but how would the server know to send just the email pane content vs all three panes content if they hit refresh
[09:26:25] <arschmitz> the url will not be any different
[09:26:26] <johnbender> well, for one the could derive it from the email, but that's not our problem
[09:27:10] <arschmitz> i guess we could advice people to check headers and see if its an ajax request or not
[09:27:17] <johnbender> arschmitz: I think what you're saying is, if they refresh they might only get the eail
[09:27:23] <arschmitz> exactly
[09:27:25] <johnbender> right
[09:27:50] <arschmitz> i guess its not unreasonable to tell them to check headers though?
[09:27:51] <johnbender> I think we would advise them to include the other pane content as well at that point
[09:27:56] <johnbender> but yes
[09:28:00] <johnbender> they can check for xhr
[09:28:05] <johnbender> to save wire weight
[09:28:14] <arschmitz> i already do that any time i use jqm to eliminate the head
[09:28:20] <johnbender> and still stay progressive
[09:28:42] <arschmitz> no need in sending the whole page head when all thats needed is the page div
[09:28:52] <arschmitz> would be the same thing
[09:28:56] <johnbender> the default recommendation would be send everything
[09:28:58] <johnbender> just like it is now
[09:29:06] <johnbender> we tell them to send the head
[09:29:09] <arschmitz> i got ya
[09:29:36] <arschmitz> ok so say they send all three panes in a container change
[09:29:52] <arschmitz> do we reload all three or just the one that was requested and ignore the other 2?
[09:30:01] <johnbender> that's the tougher question
[09:30:20] <arschmitz> i guess it could be an option
[09:30:42] <johnbender> arschmitz: the link could be anotated too
[09:30:52] <johnbender> (alternately)
[09:31:49] <johnbender> arschmitz: I don't know what the default should be there
[09:32:10] <arschmitz> i personally would think requested pane only
[09:32:15] <arschmitz> for speed
[09:32:17] <johnbender> based on a basic principles we should be refreshing everything with content from the server when we  get it
[09:32:24] <johnbender> but yah
[09:32:33] <johnbender> that's a performance issue
[09:32:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: so we have to know what the targetted pane is
[09:33:03] <johnbender> which is fiddly
[09:33:31] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm
[09:33:38] <arschmitz> to me it should be an option in change or a data-attribute
[09:33:58] <johnbender> arschmitz: I agree except that it might as well be part of the url or request at that point
[09:34:10] <johnbender> and we just established that we'd know anyhow because it would be xhr
[09:35:20] <johnbender> the only thing that sucks about that is that xhr is a header and not something explicit
[09:35:36] <johnbender> in the url that changes the content
[09:35:47] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:36:18] <johnbender> we could alter the xhr url with an extra query param &jqm-xhr=true but that feels super shady
[09:36:28] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:36:40] <johnbender> then it's really on the user to return on the content that should be refreshed
[09:36:50] <johnbender> basically we're pushing the book keeping down to the server
[09:37:09] <johnbender> either way it's on the user
[09:37:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:37:21] <johnbender> either check for the header
[09:37:24] <johnbender> hmm
[09:37:29] <johnbender> that would keep things simple on our end
[09:37:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: maybe we should just take that approach and see what happens
[09:37:47] <johnbender> we can always add on more friendly features later
[09:37:52] <johnbender> we just can't take them away
[09:38:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: which approach header or adding the param?
[09:38:10] <johnbender> header
[09:38:14] <johnbender> since it's implicit
[09:38:19] <johnbender> (no code on our part)
[09:38:37] <arschmitz> so basicly we say hey we are not going to route things for you make sure you server what you want
[09:38:40] <johnbender> the only downside there is it might fuck up people's applications if they have more than one client using ajax
[09:38:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: correct
[09:38:55] <arschmitz> yup
[09:39:11] <johnbender> if xhr then server only the refresh else serve everything
[09:39:39] <johnbender> arschmitz: I still like the idea of keeping it simple and adding on later
[09:39:41] <arschmitz> and we just go through find containers match them to ones in the page and update
[09:39:45] <johnbender> much easier to add than to walk back
[09:39:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: correct!
[09:40:00] <arschmitz> ok
[09:40:19] <arschmitz> next question currently can you have nested containers
[09:40:20] <johnbender> I think we could position it with the community as a first pass
[09:40:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: no, and I don't think we should support that
[09:40:38] <johnbender> it sounds like nightmares
[09:41:01] <johnbender> that shit is already complex enough
[09:41:01] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok sohow do you do a 2 container layout then how does the framework know not to look at it as a multi page document?
[09:41:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: containers are the parent to pages
[09:41:34] <johnbender> containers have many pages
[09:41:39] <arschmitz> right so containers lay them selves out how ever you place them
[09:41:40] <johnbender> I'm not sure if that's what you mean
[09:41:41] <arschmitz> right
[09:42:03] <johnbender> if I understand what you're saying yes
[09:42:10] <arschmitz> basicly normally your container woudl be 100% width and auto height
[09:42:10] <johnbender> you styles and lay them out as you please
[09:42:17] <johnbender> *style
[09:42:39] <arschmitz> but nothing stops you from saying i want container a float left and container b float right each 50% width for a two column 2 container layout
[09:42:54] <johnbender> right
[09:45:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: am i blind i cant find the file on github for the actual content widget?
[09:46:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's still in navigation
[09:46:09] <johnbender> it hasn't been pulled out into it's own module yet
[09:46:14] <arschmitz> ah ok
[09:46:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: and it's not merged
[09:46:27] <arschmitz> i knew it was not merged i was on your branch
[09:46:40] <arschmitz> just forgot it was in navigation
[09:47:51] <arschmitz> johnbender: so what initalizes a new container does it have to be manually with .content() or is there an attribute for autoinit 
[09:48:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: should be an attribute but we need to default to the body to support the original use case
[09:48:40] <arschmitz> right
[09:48:42] <johnbender> data-role="container" or something
[09:48:53] <arschmitz> the attribute is not there yet though right i dont see it 
[09:48:59] <johnbender> correct
[09:49:06] <arschmitz> ok cool
[09:49:07] <johnbender> because there's logic for determining the current container
[09:49:31] <arschmitz> yeah i saw it way down at bottom
[09:49:45] <arschmitz> $.mobile.pageContainer.content();
[09:50:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok so i think this is a better approach to start
[09:50:43] <arschmitz> a lot less logic to deal with on our side
[10:15:48] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15pupvogel opened issue #6111: range-slider in popup unusable  02http://git.io/-M6bnA
[12:09:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, johnbender: Ping! Do we have a solution for navreadyDeferred? Currently, if you include jquery.mobile.navigation.js by hand (for example to use the click handler), you need to manually resolve navreadyDeferred, because it's resolved from init.

[12:10:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure off the top of my head i can look in a bit need to finish something first
[12:11:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NP.
[12:11:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm looking at this as part of making custom select work outside the page.
[12:11:47] <arschmitz> i see
[12:11:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I need to do things differently depending on whether our click handler is in place or not.
[12:12:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... unless I wanna depend on it for custom select :/
[12:12:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should move the removedependants stuff to custom select
[12:12:28] <arschmitz> since its the only thing that uses them
[12:12:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: there is no more core!
[12:14:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, it doesn't use that function.
[12:14:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's supposed to, but that function has no effect.
[12:14:34] <arschmitz> ok well tests fail without it lol
[12:14:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You need to hook into pagehide and call _bindPageRemove() or whatever.
[12:14:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I looked at the tests. You can remove the tests. They're fairly contrived.
[12:15:08] <arschmitz> ok cool
[12:15:13] <arschmitz> i broke core into 3 modules
[12:15:25] <arschmitz> helpers, data, and defaults
[12:15:29] <_|Nix|_> Nice!

[12:58:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm inclined to indicate for 1.4.0 that custom select cannot be used on its own. I can almost certainly make it work outside the page in popoup-only mode, but I'd be doing that for its own sake, instead of deeply contemplating the implications on click handling, navigation, et. al.
[12:59:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im fine with that
[12:59:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and later on, especially with the content widget, the considerations may change.
[13:00:02] <arschmitz> yeah had a long talk with johnbender about that today
[13:00:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have found, for example, that the click handler is only installed after mobileinit because there used to be a $.mobile.useFastClick switch which needed to be set in the mobileinit handler before the click handler could be influenced by it.
[13:00:16] <arschmitz> our method we talked about in prortland i dont think is the way to go
[13:00:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, what then?
[13:00:43] <arschmitz> basicly dont do anything
[13:00:57] <arschmitz> leave it upto the dev to make sure they server the proper content for the url
[13:01:18] <_|Nix|_> OK. Not bad.
[13:01:22] <arschmitz> and advice them to check the xhr header to determin if they need to send everything or just  a portion
[13:01:36] <arschmitz> bill it as just a first pass and we can get fancier later
[13:01:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, for sure.
[13:02:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This multi-target deep linking is definitely an advanced feature, if we ever get to it.
[13:02:25] <arschmitz> that will be possible with this method
[13:02:37] <arschmitz> its just up to the dev and the server to work out the correct content not us
[13:03:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. Of course. The feature would be that we figure out the correct content based on the (now more complex) hash. We do not offer that feature (yet).
[13:03:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: johnbender seemed to feel pretty strongly we should not mess with the hash
[13:04:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Makes sense. We're already pushing the limits.
[13:04:53] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:05:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: doing stuff with hash is bad for PE which i had not considdered
[13:05:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One thing we could provide later is a sort of hash-to-content map hook. That is, the dev provides us with a map where a given hash tells us what to do content-whise. This would be kind of like the lookup table we talked about.
[13:05:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess #/path/to/page.html is simply not PE.
[13:06:07] <arschmitz> yup they will always end up at root 
[13:06:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, really, we're breaking PE on IE.
[13:06:29] <arschmitz> yup
[13:06:32] <arschmitz> but there is no option
[13:06:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's not PE per se, because it's only breaking PE across devices.
[13:07:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It doesn't break PE if you copy such a URL and use it yourself, but it does break PE if you copy such a URL and send it to your friend who has a C-grade phone.
[13:07:30] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:07:38] <arschmitz> but still not goo
[13:07:39] <arschmitz> d
[13:07:45] <_|Nix|_> No, definitely not good.
[13:13:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: when we added navreadyDeferred it was a quick hack to make sure our order was correct
[13:14:09] <johnbender> I think we even said at the time that we needed to address ordering more concretely
[13:19:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Right. Here's that time. It looks though that we need a more comprehensive solution, because the motivation for the ordering is that mobileinit needs to fire first, because we check a bunch of the flags settable during mobileinit in those functions.
[13:19:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, mobileinit may never come, because init may not be part of the build.
[13:20:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, we may have to break up the init module into something trivial we can depend on, and the thing that does the first page.
[13:22:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, that's not bad. I just need to do it so it's equivalent to what we have now, while still making custom builds work.
[13:23:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then, I may even be able to make the custom select work without pages, but needing the click handler.
[13:24:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_:  yah the existing assumption is that init is a dep of pretty much everything
[13:25:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so moving that part of init that is in actually depended on by everything into it's own module makes sense
[13:25:08] <johnbender> at least that way things will get slimmer
[13:27:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hmmm ... you know, OTOH, I think custom select is the only widget that /needs/ the click handler to be present. Popup needs nav, but it doesn't need the click handler. 
[13:29:02] <_|Nix|_> IIRC the reason I had to put the opening of the custom select popup through the click handler is that on android the click onto the custom select button would hit the popup or the screen behind it even though its default was prevented and everything and would cause stray focus/closure issues.
[13:29:39] <_|Nix|_> ... but I never really went to the bottom of that issue.
[13:30:31] <_|Nix|_> I can avoid this whole interaction-via-the-click-handler problem if I solved that issue instead. And then this dependency would disappear.
[13:30:47] <_|Nix|_> Which makes the idea of breaking up init no less good :)
[13:31:45] <_|Nix|_> ... because the funny thing is that currently nothing in the lib declares a dependency on init :)
[13:34:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: o.O that's not good
[13:34:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[13:34:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I guess custom select oughta.
[13:34:23] <johnbender> it's either a bug or an insight
[13:34:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It's an oversight :)
[13:34:38] <johnbender> related to the create binding
[13:34:50] <johnbender> that is we didn't want things to depend on init directly, just on that event
[13:34:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We never really checked whether the widgets work outside the page paradigm.
[13:35:10] <johnbender> yah
[13:35:12] <johnbender> hmm
[13:35:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But really, anything that checks global flags settable during mobileinit should depend on it.
[13:36:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, it should be made to depend on the reduced version of init, which simply triggers mobileinit.
[13:36:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we can now sort out what things actualy depend on different pieces of core too
[13:37:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Indeed.
[13:37:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm jotting down all kinds of todo items here :)
[13:37:40] <arschmitz> i have some in comments in different peices of core too
[13:38:07] <arschmitz> like about moving remove dependants and removing unique id and key codes once we pull in ui core
[13:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If we keep having good weather and I can wear out my daughter at the waterpark, I'll have lots of time to address these things while she sleeps things off :)
[13:38:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so slider is badly buggy on WP8
[13:38:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Uh-oh ...
[13:38:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How about the new slider?
[13:39:03] <arschmitz> seems like it drags for a certain time then get stuck every time
[13:39:11] <arschmitz> the one i wrote?
[13:39:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow!
[13:39:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[13:39:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just curious.
[13:39:25] <arschmitz> ill try
[13:39:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not like we can drop it in for 1.4, but still ... it'd be good to know.
[13:39:52] <arschmitz> yeah i think the issue is if your finger moves off the handle it loses it
[13:40:05] <arschmitz> and its so slow that ALWAYS happens lol
[13:40:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh ... are we attaching to the handle? We should attach to the document and let it bubble up ... that'll probably make it even less responsive though.
[13:41:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Remember that brief demo with the red square I made? I never even attached to the red square to begin with. I knew that would happen.
[13:42:00] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure on how it is now i need to look
[13:42:07] <arschmitz> i cant find my jsbins though :(
[13:42:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh no! Hope you had something locally, too!
[13:42:40] <arschmitz> yeah its in a repo
[13:43:33] <arschmitz> weird thoguh i had them in a spread sheet but its not in my gogle docs :|
[13:43:59] <arschmitz> or im blind
[13:44:02] <asheppard> hi all, i saw a note somewhere about giving UI the AMD treatment
[13:44:04] <arschmitz> probably the second one
[13:44:15] <asheppard> but not using the pragmasOnSave like mobile
[13:45:10] <johnbender> asheppard: they'll probably just end up using a regexp to strip 
[13:45:16] <johnbender> that was the initial discussion at least
[13:45:20] <johnbender> that could change
[13:45:26] <asheppard> curious about pros/cons
[13:45:28] <johnbender> don't quote me
[13:45:37] <johnbender> <insert additional disclaimer here>
[13:45:57] <asheppard> i'm half-considering overhauling a major library and would need to use the same approach
[13:46:09] <asheppard> mostly because of scoping
[13:46:14] <johnbender> asheppard: they're both basically regexs I think, I'm not sure but I know at least the pragmas are supported by the library
[13:46:27] <johnbender> asheppard: I'm under the impression they both are
[13:46:33] <johnbender> but there are other uses for pragmas
[13:46:40] <johnbender> so in that regard it's at least a convention of some sort
[13:46:47] <johnbender> probably doesn't matter a whole lot
[13:47:06] <johnbender> regex is probably cleaner but is less obvious at the side of the define declaration
[13:47:14] <asheppard> less obvious but prettier
[13:47:21] <johnbender> exactly
[13:47:49] <johnbender> and the value of someone being able to reconcile the disappearance of the define calls in the built js is low
[13:47:52] * johnbender shrugs
[13:47:52] <b-ot> johnbender: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:47:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think the existing slider hooks up to the document using a fairly confusing function name: _preventDocumentDrag() :/
[13:48:41] <asheppard> wonder if there's a middle ground - e.g. a shorter pragma comment
[13:48:55] <asheppard> could just use a convention i suppose
[13:49:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so mine is same and so is ui w/ touch punch :(
[13:49:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you happen to have url of red square demo?
[13:49:29] <asheppard> regex + comment convention to remind people what's happening
[13:49:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, noes!
[13:49:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Did I mention it in the chan? If so, it might be in the logs.
[13:50:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dont think so we were all just huddled around your laptop
[13:50:16] * _|Nix|_ go check IRC logs for jsbins :)
[13:50:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What about the browser history on that Android of yours?
[13:51:03] <arschmitz> was just getting it
[13:52:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in theory once it powers up it should still be on same page
[13:53:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: red square demo same :|
[13:53:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I got it.
[13:54:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ozuzos - Master of the Universe :)
[13:54:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/ozuzos/7/edit
[13:54:10] <asheppard> johnbender: semi related - i've been exploring a design pattern for making amd work w/plugins, jrburke may be interested
[13:54:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah already found it
[13:54:16] <arschmitz> and does not work
[13:54:24] <_|Nix|_> Wow!
[13:54:42] <_|Nix|_> So, who the fsck gets the events if not the doc?
[13:54:43] <asheppard> johnbender: basically each plugin amd-depends on e.g. jquery, then returns jquery (not the plugin) as the export
[13:54:45] <arschmitz> drags about 30px and stalls
[13:55:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont know ill have to look into it
[13:55:22] <asheppard> johnbender: thus if you want jquery + x in your project you just depend on jquery.x
[13:55:50] <arschmitz> not usefull though
[13:55:54] <asheppard> johnbender: if you have a bunch of plugins you want to use, you can define an amd module that depends on all of them
[13:56:11] <asheppard> johnbender: but only return the first one
[13:56:39] <asheppard> johnbender: making it still feel like a browser global but using AMD
[13:56:45] <johnbender> asheppard: that all sounds possible with a meta module, maybe I'm wrong
[13:56:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: seems like its nearly exactly 40px
[13:58:53] <asheppard> you mean a module that depends on jquery and each plugin, and then attaches plugins to the jquery object
[13:59:07] <asheppard> ?
[14:03:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ... anyway, I made a version that only drags on mousedown: http://jsbin.com/ozuzos/9/
[14:03:44] <agcolom> hi all, is it me or are the api sites really slow??? 
[14:03:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's, like, the canonical dragging example. Shouldn't make a difference.
[14:03:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: same
[14:04:04] <arschmitz> ugh
[14:04:09] <agcolom> I can't see http://api.jqueryui.com/ or http://api.jquerymobile.com
[14:04:25] <arschmitz> yikes me either
[14:04:27] <agcolom> same with http://api.jquery.com/
[14:04:36] <agcolom> stage is ok though
[14:05:13] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... slow here too - if it ever shows up ... :/
[14:05:16] <_|Nix|_> Not good.
[14:05:20] <agcolom> yes
[14:05:40] <agcolom> not sure what is going on! Thought it was my internet connection initially ;-)
[14:06:05] <agcolom> got to see core api site eventually.... after a looooong time!
[14:06:30] <agcolom> but only partially.... stilll downloading content!
[14:07:12] <agcolom> who is able to check what is going on? gnarf ?
[14:07:34] <agcolom> (api sites take forever to respond....)
[14:08:31] <asheppard> i'm seeing slowness as well
[14:08:43] <asheppard> johnbender: heading out, i'll think about these things some more
[14:09:03] <arschmitz> the server itself is timeing out even on an ssh connection :(
