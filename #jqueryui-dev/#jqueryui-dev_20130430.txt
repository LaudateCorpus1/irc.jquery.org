[11:39:35] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez For that progressbar bug should it be as simple as changing width to outerWidth here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.progressbar.js#L119, right?
[11:57:52] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, team, are you guys joining the meeting tomorrow? Or no meeting in the holiday?
[11:58:43] <kborchers> rxaviers: not a holiday in the US but not sure if we will still meet or not
[11:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I thought so, but now I think that's wrong.
[11:59:21] <rxaviers> oh really, I thought it was an international one. Labor day
[11:59:51] <kborchers> rxaviers: many countries but not US ‚Ä¶ our labor day is in September
[12:00:03] <rxaviers> ah! cool, didnt know
[12:00:39] <tj_vantoll> width( "50%" ) ‚Äî> <div style="width: 52%"></div> Blew my mind a bit. Still don't totally understand how that's happening.
[12:01:33] <kborchers> rxaviers: only reason i know that is i have people on my team from brazil, germany, france, greece and sweden and they are all off tomorrow :D
[12:01:46] <rxaviers> :)
[12:02:30] <rxaviers> working alone tomorrow in your proj than :-)
[12:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: Because with border-box, the CSS width includes everything.
[12:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> And .width() takes that into account.
[12:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> So .width( "50%" ) => Set the content width to 50%.
[12:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> But since box-sizing: border-box is in play, CSS width != content width.
[12:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> So the CSS width has to increase to account for padding and border.
[12:06:59] <tj_vantoll> Ok, so why wouldn't outerWidth fix that then?
[12:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> It seemed wrong when I tried it.
[12:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, look at what happens with the default demo if you use .outerWidth().
[12:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> Open the demo in two tabs. Then add the box-sizing rule and refresh one of them.
[12:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> The bars should be the same width, but they're not.
[12:11:38] <tj_vantoll> Interesting, looks like the height might be off a little as well.
[12:12:50] <tj_vantoll> Thanks the explanation anyways. Core's width methods are not the easiest things in the world to step through. I might dig into this one later this week if it's still unsolved.
[12:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, border-box causes all kinds of issues.

[13:04:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi! as part of our course review, I'm creating a new module (12 weeks) for second year on Advanced Client-side Programming     (i.e. HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/jQuery/jQuery UI) 
[13:04:25] <agcolom> any books you would recommend?
[13:04:45] <agcolom> (I was thinking the jQuery Cookbook by O'Reilly... any others?)
[13:06:00] <agcolom> (That's books to recommend as essential reading or further reading. There'll also be some copies purchased by the library for students to borrow
[13:06:45] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno. I don't read books :-)
[13:07:00] <agcolom> you only write them ;-)
[13:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's easier that way :-P
[13:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> I actually haven't read a full book in over a decade.
[13:07:46] <agcolom> Any books that would help the jQuery Foudation if bought...
[13:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> And I can probably count the number of books I've read in the past two decades on one hand...
[13:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> Probably the books listed on http://jquery.com/
[13:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> In the footer.
[13:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> rworth would know.
[13:09:56] <agcolom> Yes, I thought about asking rworth as well... As I'm choosing the books, I might as well do something good for the Foundation :-)
[13:10:25] <rworth> there are a handful today that help the foundation in a small amount. I hope to increase the number greatly in the future
[13:11:01] <rworth> agcolom aside from that I can highly recommend Effective JavaScript by David Herman http://effectivejs.com/
[13:11:14] <agcolom> The module won't get taught until Sept 2014, so I can always revise the list in a year's time
[13:11:19] <rworth> technical editing by myself and rwaldron and rmurphey
[13:11:24] <rworth> among a couple others
[13:11:44] <agcolom> oh nice! Thanks!
[13:12:09] <agcolom> I'll check if it's available in the UK
[13:14:31] <tj_vantoll> On a related note I got an email from someone at Manning saying they were potentially interested in publishing a book on jQuery UI.
[13:19:24] <agcolom> tj_vantoll: were they asking you to review a project or to write it?
[13:19:53] <agcolom> (they've been contacting the Mobile team to review a book project on Mobile)
[13:21:02] <tj_vantoll> They want to know whether they "could/should pursue a book on jQuery UI". They also asked if I have any interest in writing on the topic.
[13:24:07] <tj_vantoll> When I hear back from them I'll let you know. I just told them I'd be happy to provide any information they need.
[13:24:41] <agcolom> tj_vantoll: Interesting! Thanks! 
[13:36:11] <agcolom> @scott_gonzalez Sorry to bother you again... I need to document jqmData. What name should I use for $.fn.jqmData() ? (I remember that there was some naming convention I needed to follow? ) 
[13:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> jqmData
[13:36:34] <agcolom> is that all?
[13:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:36:49] <agcolom> ok, that's easy :-) Thanks!
[13:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> $.fn.x => x, $.x => jQuery.x
[13:37:11] <agcolom> that was it! Thanks! 
[13:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:37:21] <agcolom> I need to write all this!

[18:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[18:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> This is interesting: https://github.com/github/gitignore
[18:13:17] <kborchers> that is interesting ‚Ä¶ you know what's not interesting? how they change their UI on a weekly basis :/
[18:13:48] <kborchers> anyway ‚Ä¶ :)
[18:14:08] <kborchers> so i've been running the pointer special event against DaveMethvin's tests
[18:15:15] <kborchers> pointerdown has 55 passing tests and 2 fails (which are just checking if it's an instanceof PointerEvent which it's not) in Chrome, FF, Safari, Opera, iOS, Android (4.x) and Win Phone 8
[18:15:25] <kborchers> that seems pretty good
[18:15:47] <kborchers> so i moved on to pointerup like, this should be pretty close ‚Ä¶ BARF
[18:15:53] <kborchers> :(
[18:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:16:24] <kborchers> need to look through the tests and make sure i didn't miss something weird when updating them
[18:16:37] <kborchers> i have to remove some MS prefixing stuff that he added
[18:16:48] <kborchers> which i thought i did but hoping i missed something
[18:17:00] <kborchers> pointermove was just as bad so not sure what's up
[18:18:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i guess my question is, is this the best place for me to continue spending my time? i am totally willing to do it but just want to make sure i shouldn't be working elsewhere more important right now. if not, i'll keep chugging along
[18:18:32] <DaveMethvin> kborchers it wouldn't surprise me if there were probs with the tests
[18:18:53] <kborchers> oh
[18:18:55] <kborchers> hmmm
[18:18:57] <kborchers> ok
[18:19:11] <DaveMethvin> i think i got them sorta cleaned up before i landed them
[18:19:19] <DaveMethvin> but there were about a dozen people contributing stuff
[18:19:31] <DaveMethvin> and there's a lot of duplication and strange stuff in there
[18:19:41] <DaveMethvin> i'm planning to circle back and clean it all up
[18:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> I know the PEWG is anxious to get the tests moved into the new GH repo.
[18:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> So I can help go through the tests some time this week.
[18:20:35] <DaveMethvin> i think most of them are functionally close
[18:20:51] <DaveMethvin> some are kind of hard to test
[18:21:17] <DaveMethvin> like, if you have a device with 10 touch points, the 11th touch point is supposed to issue a pointercancel event
[18:21:24] <DaveMethvin> i was tempted to remove my socks
[18:21:29] <kborchers> lol
[18:21:35] <kborchers> use your nose
[18:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> o_O github.com is using jQuery 2.0.0.
[18:21:53] <kborchers> also, please have someone take a picture
[18:21:59] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:22:06] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: wat?!?
[18:22:22] <kborchers> conditionally or just straight up?
[18:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...didn't look at the source.
[18:22:34] <DaveMethvin> who's going to github with oldIE?
[18:22:40] <DaveMethvin> i guess they could pull it off
[18:22:48] <DaveMethvin> baallzzzy
[18:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> If it's conditional, it's server-side.
[18:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/assets/frameworks-92d138f450f2960501e28397a2f63b0f100590f0.js
[18:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> developer.github.com is using 1.4.2 though :-P
[18:23:53] <kborchers> yeah, cuz that is straight 2.0.0
[18:24:01] <kborchers> lol
[18:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> a = $.ajax({ ... });
[18:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> a.done(function() { ... })
[18:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'done'
[18:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> At that point, I was like, umm...what did I do?
[18:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> a.then(function() { ... })
[18:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> TypeError: Object #<XMLHttpRequest> has no method 'then'
[18:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> $.fn.jquery
[18:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> "1.4.2"
[18:25:52] <kborchers> lol
[18:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> I think I need to learn how to write a SublimeText plugin.
[18:27:14] <kborchers> o_O http://cl.ly/image/1p1t1F2Z2h29
[18:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> Must be nice.
[18:27:54] <kborchers> at least they warn you but wow!
[18:28:14] <kborchers> i currently don't support < 9 at work either
[18:28:19] <kborchers> it is nice :)
[18:28:25] <kborchers> but
[18:28:38] <kborchers> when the right people find that out i'm sure it will change :(
[18:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm shipping UI 1.11 tomorrow. We're only going to support Blink.
[18:28:50] <kborchers> then i'll be like FUUUUUUUU
[18:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> Any browser with Blink = supported.
[18:29:05] <kborchers> :D
[18:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> Any browser without Blink = use at your own risk.
[18:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, I've got an idea. 2 requirements:
[18:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> Blink + Pointer Events.
[18:29:33] <kborchers> you mean <blink> right? :P
[18:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> That should buy us time before ANYTHING needs to work.
[18:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yeah, browser must support <blink> and Pointer Events (unprefixed).
[18:30:51] <kborchers> = 0 browsers
[18:30:54] <kborchers> our work here is done
[18:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[18:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> This wiki notification service is getting trickier than I'd like.
[18:33:51] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: so yeah, back to my question. keep plugging away at testing/modifying the pointer special event (which would mean digging into those tests) or move to something else for a bit until the tests are "reliable"? though if i update the tests in my fork it will be a pain to merge back to dave's since i'm ripping out all of the prefix stuff
[18:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like I'll need to clone all the wikis to generate diffs.
[18:34:05] <kborchers> ouch
[18:35:09] <scott_gonzalez> Well, all the prefix stuff needs to not be there for the official repo anyway.
[18:35:34] <kborchers> that makes sense
