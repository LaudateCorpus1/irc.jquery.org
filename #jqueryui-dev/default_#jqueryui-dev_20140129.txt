[04:26:04] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, I've been reading (and learning) about some definitions... According to wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) "globalization" is used for the combination of internationalization and localization
[04:26:13] <rxaviers> Our current brief description says:
[04:26:27] <rxaviers>  globalize: JavaScript globalization and localization
[04:26:41] <rxaviers> I'm wondering if it would be more accurate if we rewrite it to:

[06:06:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: however at one point scott_gonzalez said he was told they had no interest in hosting mobile on their cdn
[06:12:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I know they initially didn't want to add it, but I thought they changed their mind
[06:13:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's why they asked us to send the e-mail after the 1.3.2 release, right?
[06:13:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so did i i mean paul wanted us to send them the releases
[06:13:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: exactly

[06:59:34] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: I'm not seeing any effect of the "name" change.
[06:59:51] <tj_vantoll> On my http://local.api.jquery.com/closest/, "selection" does not appear.

[07:02:48] <tj_vantoll> Ah it looks like he added commits after I last pulled in his changes.
[07:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: We got a report from Google that the comment header in the concatenated i18n min file was messed up.

[07:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object],
[07:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: This is a pretty terrible stance to take: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6991#issuecomment-33490129
[07:15:48] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, checking...
[07:15:59] <rxaviers> so, this is our release's script fault, riht
[07:16:01] <rxaviers> right*
[07:16:12] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: why is that?
[07:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's terrible to say that jQuery doesn't care about interop between our own projects.
[07:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's even worse than the BS that Bootstrap pulls.
[07:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers: Yeah, though the release script is just calling into DB.
[07:17:51] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: We do care. That's why we are working on merging.
[07:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> "we don't consider conflicts between jQuery Mobile and UI as a bug"
[07:18:11] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: But this is a result of how we have been working in the past.
[07:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter.
[07:18:50] <arschmitz> we should really reopen that we are working on merging and if it worked before and does not now thats bad
[07:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> We need to explain how to use them together or find an actual technical reason that they currently can't.
[07:19:03] <scott_gonzalez> We can't just say "Sorry, we don't care about any problems you have mixing the two."
[07:19:34] <arschmitz> and it clearly did work for 1.3 so even if we dont yet fully support autocomplete
[07:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, I think 1.4.0 has better behavior than 1.3.2.
[07:20:01] <arschmitz> we should not regress as far as interoperability
[07:20:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: That is because we don't test anything with UI widgets
[07:20:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right which is fine
[07:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> That doens't matter.
[07:20:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but it did work and now didnt so we should keep open
[07:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> When someone reports a bug using both, we need to investigate.
[07:20:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how can you avoid regressions if you don't test
[07:20:31] <arschmitz> and attempt to fix
[07:20:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we are not attempting to avoid
[07:20:57] <arschmitz> we are fixing something already reported
[07:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: His question is how do you prevent a regression of this fix if there is no test.
[07:21:39] <uGoMobi> right
[07:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you need to for this one. I just think you need to explain how to accomplish what they want.
[07:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> Though, as I said, I think the requested behavior is silly.
[07:22:02] <arschmitz> honestly dont have a good answer for that other then dont worry about it for now
[07:22:31] <arschmitz> until we do support and test
[07:22:49] <arschmitz> until then if some one reports something we do what we can to find a fix or workaround
[07:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not concerned about autocomlete positioning being off in this case. I'm concerned about the message you're sending.
[07:23:18] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I understand
[07:23:21] <arschmitz> yeah i have not really looked at the details of the bug
[07:23:38] <arschmitz> i was speaking in general more then anything
[07:24:49] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: did you also see this part of the message https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7005#issuecomment-33488031?
[07:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yes
[07:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> "I see the problem but jQuery Mobile and UI were not designed to be used together, so it's not a bug but a conflict between two frameworks that you are using" will be taken on its own by a lot of peole.
[07:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> *people
[07:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> You and I understand the history and the future, but that is a terrible summary for someone not in the know.
[07:27:14] <arschmitz> yeah we want to be careful about the message we are sending to make sure its clear
[07:45:43] <NiGhTTraX> does jquery simulate have a trac site?
[07:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> NiGhTTraX: No, it uses GitHub Issues.
[07:57:37] <NiGhTTraX> scott_gonzalez: gotcha
[07:57:54] <NiGhTTraX> I found a bug with QUnit + simulate + sortable
[07:57:57] <NiGhTTraX> not sure where to post it
[07:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> You'd have to track down where the bug is to know.
[07:58:31] <NiGhTTraX> care to take a look at it?
[07:58:46] <NiGhTTraX> I have a fiddle that reproduces it
[07:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> I hate looking at interactions, but sure, I'll take a quick look.
[07:59:22] <NiGhTTraX> http://jsfiddle.net/NiGhTTraX/KPjRf/
[07:59:38] <NiGhTTraX> it just drags a draggable to a connected sortable
[07:59:47] <NiGhTTraX> and then tests if ended up in the right location
[07:59:55] <NiGhTTraX> expected should be first position, result is last position
[08:00:06] <NiGhTTraX> if you uncomment the last line in the CSS, it works
[08:00:26] <NiGhTTraX> so the problem originates from the fact that the qunit-fixture is positioned outside of the viewport
[08:00:44] <NiGhTTraX> but I can't tell if the simulate plugin handles this wrong, or the sortable plugin
[08:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Did you test manually?
[08:01:40] <NiGhTTraX> yep, it works
[08:02:01] <NiGhTTraX> it only manifests when using QUnit
[08:02:13] <NiGhTTraX> so I can't test anything related to sortable and draggables
[08:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> What if you include the CSS and fixture markup and do it manually?
[08:02:56] <NiGhTTraX> trying it now
[08:07:16] <NiGhTTraX> hmm, weird, if use dx - 1 and dy - 1 it works in QUnit
[08:09:14] <NiGhTTraX> except if I drag it over the middle element, bleah
[08:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[08:09:43] <scott_gonzalez> The interactions are a mess.
[08:09:47] <NiGhTTraX> myeah...
[08:10:01] <NiGhTTraX> can't wait for that rewrite
[08:10:13] <NiGhTTraX> any progress on it?
[08:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> They're low priority right now because they won't land until 1.13.
[08:13:12] <NiGhTTraX> so are you still reviewing/accepting bugfixes for interactions until then?
[08:13:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but there's often a big delay.
[08:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> I like to just push them on to mikesherov's plate :-)
[08:13:54] <NiGhTTraX> :P
[08:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Though he's mostly focused on draggable right now.
[08:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> Since we have some good progress on that in the rewrite.
[08:14:44] <NiGhTTraX> I see
[08:17:09] <NiGhTTraX> here's hoping sortable will be next on the list, got some bugs there that ruin everything for me

[11:06:40] <frequent> _|Nix|_: long time no see :-)

[11:12:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im looking now will comment
[11:15:03] <arschmitz> frequent: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/dom.html#the-id-attribute
[11:15:14] <arschmitz> html allows anything but space characters
[11:16:06] <arschmitz> frequent: html5 that is
[11:19:26] <arschmitz> or maybe frequent_ ^^
[11:21:32] <_|Nix|_> frequent: AFAICT it basically means that a hash can be ([a-zA-Z0-9$-_@.&!*"'(),]|%[a-fA-F0-9][a-fA-F0-9])*
[11:22:50] <frequent> _|Nix|_: I guess then. Good to know.
[11:26:17] <arschmitz> frequent: this is a change in html 5 previously you were correct
[11:26:41] <frequent> arschmitz: I just checked my SO reference answer. It was from 2008 :-)
[11:27:08] <arschmitz> frequent: that will do it
[11:28:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Funny you should say that. I constructed that regex by looking at RFC1630 which was from 1994!
[11:29:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1630.txt and look for "BNF of Generic URI Syntax"
[11:29:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: difference between a uri and a valid html id though 
[11:29:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so the IDs were restricted.
[11:29:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. Gotcha.
[11:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> I've learned that you can't trust RFCs to reflect reality.
[11:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> Even if you're looking at the right thing.
[11:45:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still here
[11:46:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[11:47:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im starting to think we need to make a change in how we document navigate
[11:47:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do you mean?
[11:47:31] <arschmitz> people are constantly using it when there is almost no case people should be using it if they are using mobile
[11:47:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed ... click handler + navigate is really, really, really low level.
[11:48:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv yet to see someone use it correctly
[11:48:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: People should be hooking into the page change process.
[11:48:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly
[11:48:40] <arschmitz> and worse it works some times for somethings
[11:48:48] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[11:49:12] <arschmitz> because it makes people think its ok to use
[11:49:34] <_|Nix|_> I'm not sure how to convey the message that we've put a lot of safeguards into place all over the page change process and so, if people circumvent all that they're gonna have to reinvent the wheel.
[11:50:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should just say this is a low level utility and should not be called if you are using jqm it is meant as a stand alone utility
[11:50:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can do.
[11:50:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the only reason its even documented is so that people can use it by it self
[11:53:28] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #238: navigate: Document that the method is low level 02http://git.io/4TmhSQ
[11:54:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm surprised it even works ... We call navigate as the final step in the page change process ... but if you start with navigate, ... I guess the page change happens in response to the hashchange event ... or something like that ... I don't even remember anymore.
[11:54:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup its that exactly
[11:54:40] <arschmitz> we have a hashchange listener
[11:55:15] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... that turns the whole sequence on its head.
[11:55:28] <arschmitz> yes
[11:55:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: (Aside) I'm glad it works even when turned on its head :)
[11:55:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not so sure
[11:55:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it /sometimes/ works.
[11:56:03] <arschmitz> having to many ways to do the same thing can be bad
[11:56:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[11:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Whenever you get a chance, can you look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1186 ?
[11:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's a test for a ticket you unkowingly fixed :-)
[11:59:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Here's another inconsistency. Popup navigates first, and then does the DOM portion of the work ...

[12:02:26] <_|Nix|_> We really need a formalism for an interruptible sequence of asynchronous events - a sequence where you can customize what it is that advances the sequence.

[12:21:14] <arschmitz> maybe get that in a notice box?
[12:21:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. can do.
[12:22:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bam! ... if you refresh ...
[12:25:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re: Our talk about components the other day ... we have a navigate method and a navigate event, where the event does not depend on the method, but the method transitively depends on the event.
[12:26:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: looks good
[12:28:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Interestingly, the navigate method only seems to need the navigate event in order to call $.event.special.navigate.isPushStateEnabled() and $.event.special.navigate.isHashChangeEnabled() on it.
[12:29:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah they really have nothing to do with each toehr
[12:29:55] <arschmitz> other
[12:30:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wish I could've said that both the event and the method are independent components with the same name, but we're not there yet.
[12:31:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think this is one spot where the file !== component thing might come in handy. Split off the two detection methods into a file of its own and reference it from both the event and the method.
