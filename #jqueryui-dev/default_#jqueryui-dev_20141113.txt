[13:17:11] <jperrault> scott_gonzalez: did you get a chance to see why travis doesn't like my PR (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1287)?  If not, I can have another go at it.
[13:23:13] <arschmitz> jperrault: there is something not being cleaned up in destroy 
[13:25:43] <jperrault> arschmitz: ok, I see that now.  That may be the result of something I picked up when I pulled the upstream before folding my changes in.  Strange grunt didn't fail, but I'll look into it.
[13:27:48] <arschmitz> jperrault: that means its probably a race condition
[13:31:38] <arschmitz> jperrault: oh i see the problem i think your doing show and hide there 
[13:32:01] <arschmitz> jperrault: thats leaving display:block; or display:none in the dom
[13:32:09] <arschmitz> in the style attribute
[13:51:52] <jperrault> arschmitz: did that to force the calculation, couldn't get it to do that another way, but I see the problem it causes...
[13:52:09] <arschmitz> jperrault: .css( "display", "" )
[13:52:29] <arschmitz> will remove the prop from the style tag
