[00:53:50] <gabriel_schulhof> ?tell arschmitz: Another problem that arises from panel's abuse of the classes option: this.options.classes.pageContainer + "-" + this.options.theme.
[00:53:50] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: Iâ€™ll tell arschmitz: about that.
[00:55:20] <gabriel_schulhof> ?tell arschmitz It's theoretically possible that someone has redefined pageContainer, and so the swatch class used is my-custom-panel-page-container-[a-z]. This is no longer possible. Now, it has to be ui-panel-page-container-[a-z], because we can no longer use class keys as prefixes.
[00:55:20] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: Iâ€™ll tell arschmitz about that.
[00:56:34] <gabriel_schulhof> ?tell arschmitz I can't think of a way of providing a backwards-compatible way of dealing with that.
[00:56:34] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: Iâ€™ll tell arschmitz about that.
[00:58:43] <gabriel_schulhof> ?tell arschmitz This business of opening up *prefixes* for customization is not something the real classes option allows.
[00:58:43] <b-ot> gabriel_schulhof: Iâ€™ll tell arschmitz about that.

[04:41:15] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:41:31] <arschmitz> so the whole ios8 selectmenu thing
[04:41:35] <gabriel_schulhof> Right.
[04:41:41] <arschmitz> hide durring focus is broken in many places already
[04:41:59] <arschmitz> im not really sure what we should do with it as a concept as a whole
[04:42:01] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, sounds to me like we should just drop that blur(). It'd fix many bugs.
[04:42:19] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4415 it sounds to me like we're doing the best we can.
[04:42:29] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hide durring focus does not even work correctly at all in a few places
[04:42:43] <gabriel_schulhof> If we don't get the focusout on the select, there's nothing we can do about that.
[04:43:04] <gabriel_schulhof> There's no event telling us that the selectmenu was closed.
[04:43:09] <arschmitz> right but we shouldnt have a feature that does not work correctly on half of devices
[04:43:36] <gabriel_schulhof> Deprecated/remove?
[04:43:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: im not sure because its also a usability thing
[04:44:27] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: We can push that responsibility to app devs.
[04:44:33] <gabriel_schulhof> I mean, we provide fixed toolbars. Period.
[04:45:04] <gabriel_schulhof> If they clutter up an already crammed viewport, well, you might have better luck with an application-specific de-cluttering approach rather than having us guess.

[04:47:59] <gabriel_schulhof> 7492? How is that related?
[04:48:08] <gabriel_schulhof> I actually fixed that.
[04:48:18] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514
[04:48:23] <arschmitz> its not related 
[04:48:37] <arschmitz> that one i just should have been closed by one of your prs
[04:48:47] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: I'll close it manually.
[04:49:11] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: the rest are all directly related or dups for what your working on though
[04:49:23] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof closed issue #7492: destroying textinput widget without clear button fails with "element is not defined" 02http://git.io/vJkblQ
[04:50:17] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: The bottom line is: We have no event for when a selectmenu is opened or closed. It's a limitation of the platform. We can use various quirks like focusout to try to work around that, but ultimately they will let us down as the platforms change.
[04:50:46] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: its not JUST about selects though
[04:50:56] <arschmitz> hidedurringfocus is for all for elements
[04:51:14] <gabriel_schulhof> Well, form elements, right?
[04:51:19] <gabriel_schulhof> input, textarea, select
[04:51:35] <arschmitz> for/form
[04:51:59] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: ... and, I mean, like, d0000d! On mobile, when you open the keyboard or a select menu, half the viewport disappears, and you're not getting /any/ notification. That's definitely a shortcoming of the spec.
[04:52:31] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: interestingly did i ever tell you i found a way to detect a softkeyboard?
[04:52:52] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Reliably? On all our supported platforms, and well into the future?
[04:52:55] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Do tell, of course :)
[04:52:56] <arschmitz> yes
[04:53:08] <arschmitz> height of a multiselect
[04:53:34] <gabriel_schulhof> ... it changes in response to the appearance of a keyboard?
[04:53:45] <arschmitz> no to the existence of one
[04:54:06] <arschmitz> on all platforms with softkeyboard multiselects show as a single line select
[04:54:16] <arschmitz> and the multiness is part of the softkeyboard
[04:54:44] <arschmitz> so if your multiselect is taller then a single select there is no softkeyboard
[04:54:51] <arschmitz> if its the same height there is a softkeyboard
[04:55:07] <gabriel_schulhof> OK, I see. So, that's, like, a feature detection.
[04:55:14] <arschmitz> yes
[04:55:26] <gabriel_schulhof> But that doesn't help you get notified when the softkeyboard actually shows up.
[04:55:30] <arschmitz> its not supposed to be possible though :-) 
[04:55:33] <gabriel_schulhof> ... or the native select menu.
[04:55:33] <arschmitz> no not at all
[04:55:46] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: That's a cool trick!
[04:55:55] <arschmitz> we intend to use it in ui for seeing if a native fallback even makes sense or not
[04:56:07] <arschmitz> unlike on mobile doing a fall back no matter what
[04:56:36] <arschmitz> on desktop where there is no softkeyboard a native fallback makes no sense
[04:57:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Can you do the feature detection early though? I mean, in order for you to measure the height, the multiselect has to be attached to the DOM and visible.
[04:57:43] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: you make when dynamicly as part of the test way off in nowhere no where land
[04:58:16] <arschmitz> and you do it once on dom ready
[04:58:37] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah, but you cannot measure on DOM ready.
[04:58:54] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: we dont care about css
[04:59:02] <arschmitz> or anything like that we only care about the native rendering
[05:03:50] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: http://jsbin.com/lalaqu/1/edit
[05:04:01] <arschmitz> try that on a phone and it alerts true
[05:04:58] <gabriel_schulhof> Indeed.
[05:05:57] <gabriel_schulhof> I still dunno what to do about the hideDuringFocus thing. It sounds to me like we bit off more than we can chew.
[05:06:08] <gabriel_schulhof> ... considering the platform does not support us in any way.
[05:06:10] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: indeed
[05:06:38] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: yeah my feeling is deprecating and making sure there is a good extension point in places if needed
[05:06:45] <gabriel_schulhof> Yeah.
[05:06:47] <arschmitz> is probably the only reasonable thing to do
[05:07:01] <gabriel_schulhof> We already provide a mechanism for turning off fixed positioning, right?
[05:07:10] <gabriel_schulhof> So, let the application decide when to turn it off.
[05:07:15] <arschmitz> for example in apps where you control the platform a bit more
[05:07:20] <gabriel_schulhof> Yep.
[05:07:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: hide durring focus is all weird now anyway
[05:07:58] <arschmitz> it used to just unfix them
[05:08:08] <arschmitz> and now in some cases it hides them completely with display none
[05:08:21] <arschmitz> which is HORRIBLE
[05:08:29] <arschmitz> because what if you have an element in a footer
[05:10:16] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Doing global stuff from a widget is not such a good idea, although sometimes you have to.
[05:10:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: funny you say that
[05:10:53] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: since after 2.0 most of our widget will
[05:11:02] <arschmitz> because they will all be related to page layout
[05:11:07] <arschmitz> and navigation
[05:11:24] <gabriel_schulhof> page layout?
[05:12:17] <gabriel_schulhof> ... and navigation won't be /in/ the widget per se, IIRC.
[05:22:08] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: gabriel_schulhofpage layout widgets like pages / panels / toolbars
[05:22:18] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Anyway, I think for 1.4.5 we can add the setTimeout() around the blur() for select, which should prevent the crash on iOS8, and for 1.5.0 we can deprecate hideDuringFocus, which should obviate the need for having the blur() there in the first place.
[05:22:24] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: and pagecontainer is a widget and a big part of nav
[05:22:32] <gabriel_schulhof> Oh, for sure.
[05:22:42] <arschmitz> gabriel_schulhof: anyway gotta run my son to daycare
[05:22:47] <arschmitz> be back in like 30 minutes
[05:23:06] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: Well, I'll probably be gone by then, but I'll be around in your afternoon.
[05:23:12] <gabriel_schulhof> arschmitz: L8R
