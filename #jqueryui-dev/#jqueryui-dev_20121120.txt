[03:13:34] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, hi! on your jqueryUi: {stable/legacy} suggestion, your example uses "version" and "label". For "versions", we're actually using tags or branchs and formely naming it `ref`. For "label", it was formely named "description". Ok keeping those?
[03:13:50] <rxaviers> (I mean keeping the new ones)

[03:39:51] <rxaviers> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez, PS: testing the `master` branch on multi versions code, some external files seems to be missing (eg. jquery.metadata.js). Did it change in 1.10.0?

[05:52:31] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.

[06:42:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: good luck with the move
[06:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks. I really need to get off the computer and start loading the truck :-P
[06:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just ordering my 50 Mbps Internet service :-)
[06:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> Haha, Step 2 of signing up:
[06:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> "Upgrade your plan to 75/35 Mbps for a blazing-fast Internet experience."
[06:45:22] <kborchers> lol
[06:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> That's ok, I think 50/25 will be plenty fast.
[06:45:37] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: is that fios?
[06:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:45:43] <kborchers> jerk

[06:45:54] <scott_gonzalez> Should be a nice change from stupid Timer Warner.
[06:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm so glad to not have to deal with a cable company any more.
[06:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> Verizon doesn't even require a contract to get FIOS.
[06:46:18] <kborchers> wow! nice!
[06:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> And not having a contract only increases the monthly rate by $5.
[06:46:53] <kborchers> that's really nice. i also don't have a contract with my small cable company but only get 15/1
[06:51:16] <_zoggy_> i have the 75/35 plan, its great :)

[08:11:28] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: It seems that browserstack v2 API is more stable, workers start faster on average  (could be a coincedence)
[08:12:00] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: also, I'm noticing more and more these days that builds are halted for several hours because of the massive multi-multi-jquery jquery-ui builds
[08:12:11] <Krinkle> maybe we can get a second testswarm-browserstack running with a second browserstack account.
[08:12:35] <Krinkle> Not sure how many accounts we have available, but I imagine that shouldn't be a problem.
[08:12:57] <Krinkle> it'll double the quota

[09:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: We essentially have unlimited accounts, but if I remember correctly, they don't want us using multiple accounts to run automated tests.
[09:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> We can talk to them about possibly raising our concurrent worker limit.

[09:34:51] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: okay, that makes sense. On the other hand, I have a personal account at browserstack as well, and I'm sure many others do as well. I can run another instance on my own computer, basically crowdsourcing it via-via back to browserstack ;-)

[09:44:36] <gnarf> was bout to take off
[09:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see my comment about the commit that broke the effects tests?
[09:45:20] <gnarf> yeah - i had figured that was it - need to figure out how to carry over the outer* props on those objects it makes
[09:45:35] <gnarf> just hadn't dug in entirely yet
[09:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:45:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: step away from the computer!
[09:46:36] <gnarf> I might have some time this afternoon, but if not, I'll put it high on my list for tomorrow - tues is usually not a very jQuery day for me
[09:46:41] <gnarf> afk a bit
[09:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[09:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> It was indented with spaces and had <U+200B> at the end.

[10:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5301#comment:7
[10:24:30] <DaveMethvin> +1 scott_gonzalez, if it's always px then a number should be passed and if auto doesn't work there's no harm in parseInt or parseFloat
[10:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> There's nowhere in core that accepts strings, but forces pixel values, right?
[10:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> Everything that accepts a strings accepts units.
[10:25:57] <DaveMethvin> let me check one thing
[10:27:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we either expect a number and it's px or a string and we respect the units
[10:27:23] <DaveMethvin> so accepting a string and NOT respecting the units would be wrong
[10:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I thought. Thanks.
[10:28:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the U+200B sounds like a "select all copy" from jsfiddle
[10:28:31] <gnarf> jsfiddle has been adding that U+200B for like every copy lately
[10:28:45] <scott_gonzalez> Figured it was something like that.
[10:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gotta go get lunch, then more truck loading.
