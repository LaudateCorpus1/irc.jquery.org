[07:03:57] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: is datepicker using .data() events?
[07:04:11] <DaveMethvin> the customStructure test has this: inp.data('showButtonPanel.datepicker',true);
[07:06:03] <DaveMethvin> aw crap, it is
[07:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[07:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> what a mess
[07:07:58] <DaveMethvin> are those documented to work that way?
[07:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> no
[07:08:41] <DaveMethvin> oh good, so if they were to just disappear in the middle of the night ...
[07:08:45] <DaveMethvin> meet you here at 3am
[07:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> umm...are you using master?
[07:09:05] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L177
[07:09:18] <DaveMethvin> yea
[07:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, yeah, there's that.
[07:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> But you said customStructure was using .data()
[07:09:57] <DaveMethvin> using .data() to set the data
[07:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> The letters "data" do not appear in this file: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/datepicker/datepicker_core.js#L188
[07:10:47] <DaveMethvin> whoa, that's strange
[07:11:04] <DaveMethvin> wonder why my tests aren't updated
[07:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[07:12:09] <DaveMethvin> i must have pulled origin instead of upstream

[07:13:27] <DaveMethvin> ok, lessee if these tests are happier
[07:14:56] <DaveMethvin> i'm seeing the customStructure fail on 1.8.3 as well
[07:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/datepicker/datepicker.html
[07:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> What browser?
[07:15:44] <DaveMethvin> chrome
[07:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on outdated Chrome.
[07:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> PAUL!!!!!!!!
[07:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> Does it fail from view?
[07:17:12] <DaveMethvin> interesting, doesn't fail on firefox
[07:17:17] <DaveMethvin> "fail from view"?
[07:17:44] <DaveMethvin> looks to me like it doesn't have a datepicker element to work on, let me see
[07:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> From view.jqueryui.com.
[07:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> The link I pasted above :-)
[07:18:31] <DaveMethvin> nope, doesn't fail there
[07:18:54] <DaveMethvin> doesn't fail there with jquery=git either
[07:19:16] <DaveMethvin> works on ie9
[07:20:19] <DaveMethvin> oh, the original problem i was looking at was http://swarm.jquery.org/result/696733
[07:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> So something is messed up with your local checkout.
[07:20:51] <DaveMethvin> but since there was a stray datepicker there outside the fixture, the rest of the tests are probably invalid anyway
[07:20:58] <DaveMethvin> in swarm
[07:21:10] <DaveMethvin> but yeah, something also seems to be messed up locally
[07:21:15] <DaveMethvin> it could just be caching
[07:21:22] <DaveMethvin> chrome loves it some cache
[07:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's a strange swarm run.
[07:22:16] <DaveMethvin> well if jzaefferer wants to isolate some cases that do seem to be core issues, i can look at them
[07:22:25] <DaveMethvin> at least we got rid of data events!!
[07:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> \o/
[07:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> That was bad, but not as bad as the eval() we removed a few weeks ago :-P
[07:23:03] <DaveMethvin> oh also, does ui have a dependency on java still?

[08:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't have the resources to implement it.

[09:23:43] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer and other creative people, I need a variable name for `a` and `b` in "Stable(a), for jQuery 1.3.2+(b)" or "Legacy(a), for jQuery 1.3.2(b)". a) label, description? b) jQueryMin ?
[09:24:10] <rxaviers> that's the toughest part of coding :)
[09:24:50] <rxaviers> stableOrLegacy?
[09:24:56] <jzaefferer> rxaviers: not sure yet what you're looking for - what's the context?
[09:25:17] <rxaviers> config file variables to spliting the values of the above string
[09:25:48] <rxaviers> later used in rendering
[09:26:37] <rxaviers> Im ok with no answer here
[09:27:56] <jzaefferer> "label", "dependsOn"?
[09:28:06] <jzaefferer> or "version" for a?
[09:28:15] <jzaefferer> versionLabel?
[09:28:31] <rxaviers> we already have a `version` for the actual UI version
[09:28:43] <rxaviers> but that'sgreat!
[09:29:09] <rxaviers> helped

[11:43:01] <rxaviers> The links are dynamically generated based on the `config.json` attributes. scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer, do you think we should better style it? You guys can see it live at http://stage.jqueryui.com/download/
[11:47:19] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: For backCompat, if someone enters cancel, we are checking against !== null and then overwriting exclude. However what if some wacko uses exclude and then tries to change option with cancel?
[11:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine.
[11:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> If they change cancel, it needs to change exclude.
[11:48:13] <Dave_Stein> not sure how you'd want that internally since option is part of widget
[11:49:27] <Dave_Stein> all the other backcompats are just hooking to events whereas this one would need to know the option was changed in some other way

[14:01:38] <Dave_Stein> scott_gonzalez: so close to being done with backCompat ( before making unit tests work ) snap was formerly made as a plugin on top of draggable... should I just copy paste that thing as a plugin still? i'm not forgetting this feature is your fault :P
[14:02:54] <Dave_Stein> well a direct copy paste won't work but ehhh ill take what i can
[14:03:19] <Dave_Stein> why are the "s" options the worst? scroll x3 snapx3 and stack
[14:03:36] <Dave_Stein> anywho DaveMethvin excuse my ranting but can you help out with grunt?
[14:07:39] <DaveMethvin> YES!
[14:07:43] <DaveMethvin> just got off the call
[14:08:10] * DaveMethvin turns "The Doctor is IN" sign over
[14:08:28] <DaveMethvin> so what are your symptoms Dave_Stein
[14:08:55] <Dave_Stein> heyo soooo
[14:09:02] <Dave_Stein> when i do "grunt.cmd" in the folder with "grunt.js"
[14:09:05] <Dave_Stein> it complains about bad line endings
[14:09:15] <DaveMethvin> what's the message?
[14:09:58] <Dave_Stein> line1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
[14:10:08] <Dave_Stein> after the location of npm on my comp
[14:10:15] <Dave_Stein> followed by line7: syntax error: unexepcted end of file
[14:10:35] <DaveMethvin> hmm, never  heard that one
[14:10:41] <DaveMethvin> let me ask a few questions
[14:11:04] <DaveMethvin> are you using a windows command line, or do you have something like msysgit?
[14:11:26] <Dave_Stein> I'm inside git bash because it hasn't failed me for anything since i got it 
[14:11:30] <Dave_Stein> although that's probably very strange
[14:11:34] <DaveMethvin> no, that's good
[14:11:44] <DaveMethvin> so, in that case
[14:12:08] <DaveMethvin> the grunt.cmd, can you edit that file
[14:12:26] <DaveMethvin> if you say      which grunt.cmd    it shoudl tell you where the file is
[14:12:55] <Dave_Stein> that doesnt work but its in my appdata/roaming/npm folder from making it global
[14:13:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, sounds right
[14:13:05] <Dave_Stein> should i go there and vi in, or just open in my default text editor?
[14:13:15] <DaveMethvin> what's your default editor?
[14:13:22] <Dave_Stein> notepad++
[14:13:31] <DaveMethvin> me too! bro!
[14:13:37] <DaveMethvin> go to np++
[14:13:43] <Dave_Stein> excellent i'm going to make fun of the sublime users here now 
[14:13:46] <DaveMethvin> that way i'll know all the stuff to say
[14:14:25] <Dave_Stein> and there i am
[14:14:29] <DaveMethvin> so if you edit that in np++ and then go to Edit, EOL Conversion, what does it have grayed out?
[14:14:41] <Dave_Stein> Windows Format
[14:14:47] <DaveMethvin> ok, so that's good
[14:14:52] <DaveMethvin> let me go to that file on my system too
[14:16:21] <DaveMethvin> haha, please don't edit manually
[14:16:24] <DaveMethvin> they are SO cute
[14:16:31] <DaveMethvin> So, edit this file manually
[14:16:41] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:16:43] <Dave_Stein> of course]
[14:16:53] <DaveMethvin> remove that @ from in front of the IF
[14:17:10] <DaveMethvin> then run it and see which line runs
[14:17:11] <Dave_Stein> ok
[14:17:16] <Dave_Stein> still 1 then 7
[14:17:21] <Dave_Stein> although the file only has 6 lines
[14:17:30] <Dave_Stein> at least according to np
[14:17:46] <DaveMethvin> but when you run it, which line does it exeucte?
[14:18:02] <DaveMethvin> it should echo out the if
[14:18:17] <DaveMethvin> then expand out all those variables 
[14:18:20] <Dave_Stein> it's not echoing out anything 
[14:18:46] <DaveMethvin> well it does for me
[14:18:51] <DaveMethvin> so that's a sign right there
[14:19:08] <Dave_Stein> what if i do a save with trim white space?
[14:19:18] <DaveMethvin> if you removed the @ and saved the file, it should have run ... sure trim it
[14:19:24] <Dave_Stein> oh and what's your encoding?
[14:19:33] <DaveMethvin> ANSI
[14:19:49] <Dave_Stein> ill convert to ANSI then ... im in UTF-* without BOM
[14:20:02] <DaveMethvin> probably doesn't matter but yeah
[14:20:13] <Dave_Stein> nope it didnt matter... just trying to limit some variables here
[14:20:24] <DaveMethvin> i think we should look at paths
[14:20:42] <DaveMethvin> so does the   which grunt.cmd   work for you?
[14:20:46] <Dave_Stein> nope
[14:20:48] <DaveMethvin> which should be on your path
[14:21:05] <DaveMethvin> so in shell,  echo $PATH
[14:21:10] <Dave_Stein> i mean it doesn't error saying it's not a command
[14:21:28] <DaveMethvin> oh like it's no output at all?
[14:21:36] <Dave_Stein> correct
[14:21:45] <Dave_Stein> my path has the roaming npm folder
[14:21:54] <Dave_Stein> along with lots of other goodies of course
[14:22:26] <DaveMethvin> so what did you install to get the bash shell?
[14:23:15] <Dave_Stein> which one? the npm shell?
[14:23:53] <DaveMethvin> well, like you have some minimal set of unix-like tools now ... where did those come from?
[14:24:47] <Dave_Stein> i have a fresh install of windows 7 from last week and literally only installed git bash, and then npm
[14:24:59] <Dave_Stein> the git bash version Git-1.8.0-preview20121022
[14:25:10] <DaveMethvin> ok, i'm not sure what git bash installs
[14:25:19] <DaveMethvin> the two i've used are msysgit and cygwin
[14:25:35] <DaveMethvin> let me search for a sec
[14:26:11] <Dave_Stein> my coworker always asks me how i got this far in life heh I know like zero about using computers just programming JS/PHP/MySQL although it hasn't screwed me other than frustrating people at times. thanks for help again
[14:26:22] <DaveMethvin> no, it's not you
[14:26:25] <DaveMethvin> it's windows
[14:26:32] <DaveMethvin> honestly, i don't know why i torture myself
[14:26:52] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that you have to make windows look like linux/unix
[14:27:11] <DaveMethvin> and the rest of the world assumes windows with this extra stuff installed works like linux/unix
[14:27:16] <DaveMethvin> BUT IT DOESN'T
[14:27:30] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:27:31] <DaveMethvin> i think git-bash may be msysgit
[14:27:49] <DaveMethvin> i better not install it tho
[14:27:50] <Dave_Stein> it says MINGW32 if that means anything useful 
[14:27:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:28:34] <DaveMethvin> okay, just to make it easier for you to copy/paste from your command shell, do you have Quick Edit turned on?
[14:29:04] <DaveMethvin> click the little c:\ icon at the top of the window and select Properties
[14:29:24] <Dave_Stein> er i dont see that option in there
[14:29:24] <DaveMethvin> on the Options tab, check QuickEdit Mode
[14:29:31] <Dave_Stein> oh wait
[14:29:32] <Dave_Stein> there it is
[14:29:38] <Dave_Stein> ok done turned on
[14:29:58] <DaveMethvin> ok so now you can highlite text and hit enter to copy it
[14:30:05] <DaveMethvin> and to paste you just right click
[14:30:13] <DaveMethvin> makes live so much easier
[14:30:20] <DaveMethvin> life even
[14:30:30] <Dave_Stein> ok so should i try pasting in the line frmo the cmd?
[14:30:56] <DaveMethvin> first i wondered what your path looked like
[14:31:02] <DaveMethvin> so copy that and paste
[14:31:10] <Dave_Stein> iCLS Client/:/c/Program Files/Intel/iCLS Client/:/c/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA C
[14:31:10] <Dave_Stein> orporation/PhysX/Common:/c/Windows/system32:/c/Windows:/c/Windows/System32/Wbem:

[14:31:22] <Dave_Stein> oh i missed a a spot
[14:31:25] <DaveMethvin> now THAT's a path
[14:31:35] <Dave_Stein> iCLS Client/:/c/Program Files/Intel/iCLS Client/:/c/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA C

[14:31:48] <Dave_Stein> god damn its not picking the first line
[14:31:52] <DaveMethvin> np
[14:31:57] <DaveMethvin> i got the gist of it
[14:32:24] <DaveMethvin> all these junk utils want to add their stuff to the path, drives me crazy
[14:32:38] <Dave_Stein> ha well do you think me installing cygwin would be of use
[14:32:48] <DaveMethvin> oh, when you select in the command prompt window you have to select a rectangle btw
[14:32:58] <DaveMethvin> so multiple line copies get a bit strange
[14:33:21] <DaveMethvin> i am try trying to figure out why simple stuff like which doesn't work
[14:33:23] <Dave_Stein> since it'll give me some supposedly-useful commands
[14:33:52] <DaveMethvin> can you paste the error message you get from grunt.cmd?
[14:34:26] <Dave_Stein> $ grunt.cmd
[14:34:26] <Dave_Stein> g for matching `''
[14:34:26] <Dave_Stein> d of file
[14:34:32] <Dave_Stein> ughhh
[14:35:09] <DaveMethvin> be sure to select the rectangle
[14:35:09] <Dave_Stein> hm 
[14:35:20] <Dave_Stein> its funny i just copy pated it into notepad and then pasted one line into here and it didnt go
[14:35:26] <Dave_Stein>  /c/Users/Dave/AppData/Roaming/npm/grunt.cmd: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
[14:35:32] <Dave_Stein> it wouldnt let me type something starting with a /
[14:35:37] <Dave_Stein>   /c/Users/Dave/AppData/Roaming/npm/grunt.cmd: line 7: syntax error: unexpected end of file
[14:35:52] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[14:36:13] <DaveMethvin> there is not even a backtick in that file!
[14:36:23] <Dave_Stein> that's what i thought
[14:37:04] <DaveMethvin> what happens when you type    node test.js
[14:37:16] <DaveMethvin> does it try to run node?
[14:38:02] <Dave_Stein> module.js:340
[14:38:02] <Dave_Stein>     throw err;
[14:38:02] <Dave_Stein>           ^
[14:38:02] <Dave_Stein> Error: Cannot find module 'c:\Repositories\jquery-ui\test.js'
[14:38:02] <Dave_Stein>     at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:338:15)
[14:38:03] <Dave_Stein>     at Function.Module._load (module.js:280:25)

[14:38:07] <Dave_Stein>     at process.startup.processNextTick.process._tickCallback (node.js:244:9)
[14:38:14] <DaveMethvin> ok, that's good
[14:38:16] <DaveMethvin> it ran node
[14:39:01] <Dave_Stein> Boy is my computer a marvel today
[14:39:03] <DaveMethvin> if you copy the grunt.cmd to the current directory and run it, does it still do the same thing?
[14:39:46] <Dave_Stein> yeah same error with it sitting in jquery-ui folder
[14:40:08] <DaveMethvin> man i am stumped
[14:40:13] <DaveMethvin> i just can't figure 
[14:40:18] <DaveMethvin> where the error is coming from
[14:40:30] <Dave_Stein> damn you ben_alman! ha
[14:40:49] <DaveMethvin> oh waitaminit
[14:41:04] <DaveMethvin> is that cmd syntax?
[14:41:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah it was for me
[14:41:32] <Dave_Stein> i never had to run a .cmd file before but i saw people say on stack for random questsions that it's the syntax
[14:41:36] <Dave_Stein> aka they said "just type grunt.cmd"
[14:41:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah that part 
[14:41:47] <DaveMethvin> but the stuff inside the cmd file
[14:41:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's right
[14:42:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, maybe installing msysgit
[14:43:02] <DaveMethvin> the problem is, you do this setup so rarely it's easy to forget if there were issues
[14:43:17] <DaveMethvin> and sometimes things can kinda sorta work for a long time
[14:43:26] <Dave_Stein> i got a win
[14:43:30] <Dave_Stein> from using cygwin
[14:43:31] <Dave_Stein> :D
[14:43:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[14:43:40] <Dave_Stein> its complaining I don't have a buncha node modules installed
[14:43:46] <DaveMethvin> npm install
[14:43:46] <Dave_Stein> rather grunt modules
[14:43:49] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[14:43:56] <Dave_Stein> install -g i would imagine
[14:43:57] <Dave_Stein> right
[14:44:22] <DaveMethvin> now you have every unix utility known to man i'm sure
[14:44:27] <Dave_Stein> haha
[14:44:33] <DaveMethvin> you can design nuclear reactors, dog!
[14:44:52] <DaveMethvin> ok but that's a good signg
[14:45:02] <Dave_Stein> yeah maybe after i install these 5 packages i can be happy
[14:45:18] <Dave_Stein> and then tell other windows users " get cygwin if you don't, you idiot, to use grunt" ;)
[14:45:22] <DaveMethvin> eternal optimist, let's see if your hopes are dashed
[14:45:33] <Dave_Stein> im always optimistic
[14:45:37] <Dave_Stein> you catch that link i posted before? heh
[14:45:43] <DaveMethvin> i've gotten it to work with msysgit too
[14:45:52] <DaveMethvin> something smaller, i dunno
[14:46:03] <Dave_Stein> hey do you nkow the guys from Adobe team that helped jquery mobile by any chance
[14:47:01] <DaveMethvin> you mean like johnbender and kinblas?
[14:47:19] <Dave_Stein> maybe? all i know as of now is that people fmo there helped jquery and was gonna look into it more after the holidays heh
[14:47:46] <DaveMethvin> you can also head over to jquerymobile-dev, they all accumulate there :)
[14:47:57] <Dave_Stein> good point
[14:48:11] <DaveMethvin> ok, so are things looking better?
[14:48:18] <Dave_Stein> okay i did a global install for all the missing packages yet when i grunt grunt.cmd it says i dont have them isntalled still
[14:48:29] <Dave_Stein> i restarted the shell too
[14:48:45] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't install the packages global, just do a normal npm install for packages
[14:48:50] <Dave_Stein> or rather now that i'm reading it more carefully
[14:48:53] <Dave_Stein> i was about to say that
[14:49:09] <Dave_Stein> cause it says "local npm module"
[14:49:21] <Dave_Stein> my reading abilities are the greatest
[14:49:26] <DaveMethvin> so what errors are you getting?
[14:49:41] <Dave_Stein> almost there
[14:49:43] <Dave_Stein> doing local is helping
[14:50:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah, bla bla bla 304 
[14:50:08] <DaveMethvin> and then, suddenly, success
[14:51:08] <Dave_Stein> it appears to be working
[14:51:48] <Dave_Stein> mikesherov told me that it would be smart enough to not cmoplain about me using the function headers "event, ui" yet its saying they are unused 
[14:52:00] <DaveMethvin> nice
[14:52:13] <DaveMethvin> what does that guy know :D
[14:52:22] <DaveMethvin> so you good, Dave_Stein
[14:52:23] <DaveMethvin> ?
[14:52:26] <Dave_Stein> more than me haha
[14:52:56] <DaveMethvin> 48 megabytes of download later, you can run grunt
[14:53:04] <Dave_Stein> i suppose so, i'll ask scott_gonzalez and mikesherov more about any options I might be missing because it's definitely complianing about things it shouldnt be
[14:53:14] <DaveMethvin> like what?
[14:53:22] <Dave_Stein> all the event, ui not being used
[14:53:44] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, are you on the right branch, and did a git pull of that branch?
[14:53:54] <Dave_Stein> im in the interactions branch ... only place i ever work on
[14:54:12] <DaveMethvin> ok, well i'll let them sort it out then
[14:54:21] <DaveMethvin> good luck, i'm always a ping away
[14:54:40] <Dave_Stein> yup yup thanks again
[15:01:02] <Dave_Stein> also scott_gonzalez stack never appeared to be able to change after the fact as it alters the zindex on start and never has a way to go back
