[04:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I didn't update QUnit's XSL yet, because I need to add a new feature to make it actually use the same transforms.
[04:45:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: no problem, i figured that was what was going on I just wanted to make sure it was known

[08:28:02] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez kborchers: what happened to the options listing here? http://stage.api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.config/
[08:28:26] <jzaefferer> as seen here: http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.config/
[08:29:02] <kborchers> without actually looking my guess would be scott_gonzalez's xsl change today but could be wrong
[08:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'll look into that right now.
[08:32:20] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is that it's using <option>?
[08:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it is
[08:33:34] <jzaefferer> kind of a hack to begin with
[08:33:41] <jzaefferer> but a useful one in that context
[08:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is something that only QUnit does.
[08:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why it got dropped (I didn't known about it)
[08:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> The XSL is actually smarter now, it only applies transforms that relate to the entry type.
[08:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> And <option> as a whole was removed.
[08:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> But there's a new <option> which is widget options.
[08:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> I can add support for properties to have subproperties.
[08:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kborchers: Needs updated styling, but: http://cl.ly/image/2V3d260j320H

[08:57:31] <kborchers> yep
[08:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> Compare deepEqual to any method from UI to see what I mean.
[08:58:40] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: did we come up with a name for the overrides category?
[08:58:58] <scott_gonzalez> I used "Method Overrides" for the name and "overrides" for the slug.
[08:59:04] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i stopped making the changes to other site styles so i could make an attempt at cleaning up base.css
[08:59:05] <jzaefferer> k
[08:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ok :-)
[08:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> meeting time!
[09:29:44] <jzaefferer> kborchers: do you have write access to the qunitjs.com repo?
[09:30:01] <kborchers> checking
[09:30:09] <jzaefferer> looks like you do
[09:30:12] <jzaefferer> content team!
[09:30:12] <kborchers> yes
[09:30:28] <jzaefferer> I can fix that :p
[09:31:13] <kborchers> ?
[09:44:27] <jzaefferer> kborchers: I was implying I could remove your write access. NOT FUNNY ANYMORE
[09:44:44] <kborchers> :)
[09:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6894 ?
[09:50:18] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: currently it sucks to find an example for, say, the transfer effect
[09:50:26] <jzaefferer> I want that to become a lot easier
[09:50:44] <scott_gonzalez> So just split all of the effects demos into separate files?
[09:51:03] <jzaefferer> That would help..
[09:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just hold off on this, it's not something easy to address for 1.9.

[11:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what happened to jzaefferer.
[11:04:43] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: here
[11:04:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: and yeah, qunitjs.com/intro uses that
[11:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I wonder why my search didn't show that.

[12:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you publish a new version of grunt-jquery-content?
[12:07:42] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: sure
[12:07:47] <jzaefferer> just publish?
[12:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> bump the version, tag, and publish.
[12:08:10] <jzaefferer> right
[12:08:11] <jzaefferer> well
[12:08:15] <jzaefferer> I've never tagged so far :p
[12:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh, so just bump the version and publish :-)
[12:08:47] <jzaefferer> looks like 0.4.0 to me
[12:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> +1

[12:11:02] <jzaefferer> also fixed
[12:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com is now running on 0.4.x :-)
[12:13:42] <jzaefferer> nice
[12:14:20] <jzaefferer> hu, I never pushed my update to the build-download task :/
[12:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:15:04] <jzaefferer> HOW THAT HAPPENED
[12:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: Do you know how to do this properly? https://gist.github.com/bf778599eb3a24d9adc4
[12:52:45] <kborchers> :/
[12:52:52] <kborchers> hmmm
[12:53:12] <kborchers> not sure if i've ever done something like that. let me think
[12:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you know what, this isn't going to work.
[12:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> We don't do placeholders inside code.
[12:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> And it'd probably be silly to add that.
[12:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> Though I would love to not duplicate this code for every effect.
[12:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, I'll just duplicate it.
[12:55:51] <kborchers> yeah, i can't see any way around that right now. seems like it should be doable but also feels wrong
[12:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[12:56:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: hey
[12:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Got time to get the "All" category working?
[12:57:34] <nacin> running a meeting in 3 minutes
[12:57:41] <nacin> I will help you get it working either tonight or tomorrow
[12:57:44] <nacin> what approach have you taken so far?
[12:57:48] <nacin> I was off my game last time we spoke. :-)
[12:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> umm...not sure if I still have the code.
[12:59:34] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check.
[13:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, don't have it anymore.
[13:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe in a private gist of yours?
[13:01:37] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't appear to be in a public gist.
[13:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Just got an .ai file from the designers.
[13:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'll convert to Photoshop for you.
[13:04:04] <kswedberg> thx, scott_gonzalez !
[13:08:42] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I recalled you were going to do a page template?
[13:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, my thought was creating a custom page, you thought we could do it some other way.
[13:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Either generating a .psd from this .ai file is a really intensive process or AI is just hanging during the export...
[13:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> oy, I can't even email it.
[13:14:48] <kswedberg> ugh. ok. don't worry about it.
[13:15:00] <kswedberg> I think I might actually have it.
[13:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to upload it to my site.
[13:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> It was just a very intensive save.
[13:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's >60MB
[13:15:25] <kswedberg> oh wait. I just have the plugins site (in Illustrator format).
[13:16:00] <kswedberg> yikes
[13:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's like 10x bigger than the .ai file.
[13:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's uploading right now.
[13:16:56] <kswedberg> crazy. thx for dealing with that.
[13:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: http://temp.nemikor.com/jQuery%20API.psd
[13:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: If you want a PSD with the API site designs ^
[13:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: This includes the new design for widgets too.
[13:25:42] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez thx!
[13:25:55] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: cool, thanks
[13:37:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pong
[13:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You're killing me with these delays. My memory isn't that good :-P
[13:38:51] <gnarf> you pinged me like right after i fell asleep :)
[13:38:55] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:39:04] <scott_gonzalez> Can we switch web-base-template to master on prod?
[13:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> The only deployed sites are jquery.com and qunitjs.com, right?

[14:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer kswedberg: Effects are all documented! http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/bounce-effect/
[14:15:07] <jzaefferer> nice
[14:15:29] <kswedberg> looks great
[14:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:29:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i believe so
[14:29:37] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: And wordpress autocompletion awesomeness
[14:29:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lets do it if you're ready
[14:29:40] <Krinkle> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/bounce
[14:30:07] <Krinkle> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/bo works too
[14:30:08] <Krinkle> :P
[14:30:16] <Krinkle> though http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/b is blind-effect
[14:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: heh
[14:39:16] <Krinkle> Hm.. can we disable the "comment feed" <link> for api sites?
[14:39:40] <Krinkle> can be done from functions.php afaik, not sure if that is accessible in our setup (abstracted)
[15:09:03] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: like here? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/blob/master/themes/jquery/functions.php
[15:27:01] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: :)
[15:30:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do you want to handle that switch on jq01 ?
[15:41:04] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I have some time in a bit to focus on category/all
[15:42:08] <nacin> Krinkle: jzaefferer: you'll probably want to remove_theme_support( 'automatic-feed-links' )
[15:42:27] <nacin> I had a question re: timing of future jQuery UI releases. is there some kind of target for 1.9?
[15:42:59] <nacin> ah, 1.9 RC. I'm happy to drop that into WP master if you'd like.
[15:43:21] <Krinkle> As the default?
[15:43:32] <Krinkle> like wordpress core, next release?
[15:43:43] <nacin> Krinkle: yes. we always try to ship the latest.
[15:44:00] <nacin> but I mean we can drop RC in now, to help test.
[15:44:06] <Krinkle> Then ship jQuery UI 1.8.23 and jQuery 1.8, that is release last week. Fresh as it gets, and stable.
[15:44:17] <Krinkle> as long as it doesn't end up in a release then it should be fine.
[15:44:26] <nacin> correct. we're not shipping 3.next until December.
[15:44:55] <Krinkle> make sure to note in whatever prodecure you use that the rc must not ship
[15:45:02] <nacin> I mixed up jQuery and jQuery UI, forgot 1.9 was already at RC.
[15:45:08] <nacin> Krinkle: I know :-)
[15:45:24] <Krinkle> the more the merrier
[15:46:12] <nacin> I used to just follow your meeting agendas; now I follow IRC, github, etc., and it's tough to have a macro view of things.
[15:56:05] <Krinkle> the deeper you go, the less simple it gets to know what to do from outside - right ?
[15:56:15] <Krinkle> abstraction is nice, but I like details as well
[15:57:51] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle do we have a plan for adding chrome21 ff15 ie10?
[15:58:19] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: us parser (browscap) ; browserstack ; testswarm-browserstack ; testswarm
[15:58:40] <Krinkle> and then update jq03 testswarm.json browserSets popular
[15:58:42] <Krinkle> in that order
[15:59:28] <DaveMethvin> uh, okay, i have no idea how that part works
[16:00:51] <Krinkle> in a few months two of those dependencies will be gone (browsecap will be replaced with a smarter ua-parser that looks for priotized patterns instead of (almost) hardcoded strings for each and every version and variation), and testswarm-browserstack will get smarter at querying browserstack for what it has to offer and map accordingly
[16:00:59] <Krinkle> [..] , and testswarm-browserstack will get smarter at querying browserstack for what it has to offer and map accordingl
[16:01:08] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: the first two we don't control
[16:02:08] <Krinkle> brb foodbreak
[18:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: The rc is pretty damn stable. I'd recommend putting that in WordPress over 1.8.23.
[18:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: 1.8.x will never be as stable as master.
[18:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We're hoping to have 1.9 final in a week or two. The code is stable, we're just working on all the surrounding infrastructure right now.
[18:22:00] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: spinner and menu appear new, does that sound right?
[18:22:18] <nacin> the fun part is trying to update own script loader and dependency trees.
[18:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> yup, spinnner, menu, and tooltip
[18:22:41] <nacin> and the effects files were all renamed
[18:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[18:24:20] <nacin> lovely.
[18:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't look very pretty right now, but it's the complete upgrade guide.
[18:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> There shouldn't be too much that you *have* to change right away.
[18:25:33] <nacin> ooh. I think we'll do $.uiBackCompat = false for our debug mode.
[18:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> effects files renamed
[18:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> autocomplete now depends on menu
[18:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> You may have lots to change for that :-)
[18:26:58] <nacin> maybe not right away. would be a wild ride though.
[18:27:08] <nacin> (maybe not doing it right away)
