[03:24:20] <AndromedaK> Hi guys!
[03:24:41] <AndromedaK> Does somebody have experience with jquery tabs and google maps v3?
[03:24:54] <AndromedaK> I solved but my solution it's not perfect
[03:25:11] <AndromedaK> I need to click two times on the tab to see the full map
[03:25:25] <AndromedaK> the first time that I load the page and I click on map-tab
[03:25:30] <AndromedaK> I see correctly the page
[03:25:39] <AndromedaK> but after that I click on another tab
[03:25:49] <AndromedaK> and another time on map tab
[03:25:57] <AndromedaK> I don't see the full map
[03:26:04] <AndromedaK> so I click again on map tab
[03:26:12] <AndromedaK> to see the full map
[03:26:42] <AndromedaK> I used this approach: <li><a href="#tab3" onclick="loadScript();">Maps</a></li>

[03:44:01] <jzaefferer> AndromedaK: #jquery is the right place for that
[03:50:07] <AndromedaK> ok
[03:50:09] <AndromedaK> thank you

[06:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> BrowserStack is backlogged again :-(
[06:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin jzaefferer: We should keep the UI discussion out of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12213
[06:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> That ticket is already pretty big.
[06:07:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, fine with me ... you might want to try the special event approach, i think it may be the easiest way
[06:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> I've got it on my list. I view it as low priority since there are no pending problems.
[06:08:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah as long as nobody is complaining about it being slow, it's not slow :)
[06:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> Hell, I still haven't addressed John's comment from years ago that we should separate removal and destruction.
[06:09:05] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12569 on the other hand has been killing me
[06:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> When you manually destroy a widget, we undo EVERYTHING.
[06:09:22] <DaveMethvin> the old isEventSupported is just broken totally
[06:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> If you're removing, there's no need for us to do that.
[06:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> We only need to remove generated content that lives outside of the widget, like autocomplete's menu.
[06:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but at least the old one is less broken :-P
[06:10:23] <DaveMethvin> well it passes unit tests, but only because unit tests are bad
[06:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it breaks less code.
[06:11:10] <DaveMethvin> chrome offers a focusin event but we can't detect it; opera is totally stupid about the detection as well
[06:11:31] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, UI's tests are just testing general focus events.
[06:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> And they're broken.
[06:11:50] <DaveMethvin> i have a better test for focus now i think
[06:12:08] <DaveMethvin> i sure wish we could test pull requests in testswarm
[06:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of running scripts against PRs.
[06:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we can do the CLA thing, it requires you to log in to Google Docs.
[06:14:47] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[06:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> Unless we can generate a public spreadsheet with just name + email from the private spreadsheet.
[06:15:31] <scott_gonzalez> But we've already had one person say they didn't want their email address public.
[06:23:26] <jzaefferer> are git commits public as well?
[06:23:32] <jzaefferer> *aren't
[06:28:11] <petersendidit> You have to have a public email address to be on github
[06:29:00] <petersendidit> Well maybe not
[06:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Yes, that was my argument too.
[06:30:37] <DaveMethvin> people often have junk in their github setups, which of course makes our job all that much harder
[06:30:59] <DaveMethvin> git doesn't require a valid email or name in the commit info
[06:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/685#issuecomment-6753856
[06:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Well, we now require valid email addresses in git to match against the CLA.
[06:31:28] <DaveMethvin> right
[06:31:36] <DaveMethvin> that guy is being to prissy about his email
[06:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> Isaac even chimed in :-)
[06:31:50] <DaveMethvin> give it up, spammers can always reach you
[06:31:56] <DaveMethvin> use a throwaway
[06:32:47] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, hi scott, just curious why switching to a font instead of using images for icons (as currently) is something we wont do. Because of cross compat?
[06:35:26] <jzaefferer> "You can't put the feathers back in the pillow once they're scattered to the wind."
[06:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> Because nobody will use them properly.
[06:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> Our sites don't even use them properly.
[06:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> I cringe every time I have to add an icon to one of our new sites.
[06:36:11] <scott_gonzalez> Icon fonts create accessibility issues.
[06:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> The proper use is <span aria-hidden="true">
[06:44:03] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery UI - 1.8.x core build #94: STILL FAILING in 45 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.8.x%20core/94/
[07:26:38] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: you around?
[07:26:50] <kswedberg> yes. hi scott_gonzalez
[07:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm finally looking into https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/21
[07:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> I think the best we can do with a sane solution is getting the full text in the category page.
[07:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> So tags will be stripped, but the full text will be there.
[07:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> Does that seem ok?
[07:29:29] <kswedberg> sure. so I'm clear, the tag stripping happens for the <desc> in the list of methods, right? Not in the category description?
[07:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> correct.
[07:29:44] <kswedberg> so it'll also happen on the homepage.
[07:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> So ajaxComplete will say "Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an AjaxEvent." but AjaxEvent won't be a link.
[07:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> right
[07:30:08] <kswedberg> yeah, that's fine.
[07:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> But on api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete the link will be there.
[07:30:21] <kswedberg> cool. I think that's a fine compromise.
[07:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:30:37] <kswedberg> and thank you, scott_gonzalez!
[07:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that escape-string expects to be working on a string, but it's actually working on a set of nodes.
[07:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> So we'd need to write our own template for that.
[07:31:11] <kswedberg> which could get dicey?
[07:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> Alternatively, we could pre-process it and concert the nodes to their string equivalents, which is a bit crazy.
[07:31:23] <scott_gonzalez> s/concert/convert/
[07:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> It boils down to us wanting to treat <desc> as if it were CDATA, but it's not.
[07:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> But only in the one specific case of the excerpt.
[07:32:23] <kswedberg> yeah, that makes sense. And it can't be CDATA, because then it will be all escaped in the entry.
[07:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> right
[07:33:24] <kswedberg> so, let's stick with having tag-stripped excerpt for now, and if someone feels really motivated sometime down the road to make it better, he/she can have at it.
[07:33:31] <kswedberg> sound reasonable?
[07:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:33:37] <kswedberg> awesome.
[07:34:10] <kswedberg> (and sorry, btw, for being underground the last couple weeks. too much going on at work/home)
[07:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, didn't even notice.
[07:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> I was in Florida for a week, and we've been super busy getting ready for our move.
[07:34:56] <kswedberg> :D
[07:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just committed and published.
[07:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> I also updated api.jquery.com's package.json.
[07:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> So if you pull and npm install, you should have better excerpts.
[07:37:13] <kswedberg> awesome. thx!
[07:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[07:55:26] <rxaviers> scott_gonzalez, ok thanks for the explanation

[08:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Do you have a reduced test case showing this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8740#comment:7
[08:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> I can't seem to reproduce it in a standalone test.
[08:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/Nb55v/
[08:54:28] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: but you see the issue here, right? http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/zGkxX/
[08:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:56:16] <jzaefferer> so no, I don't yet have a reduced case
[08:56:38] <jzaefferer> my fix worked as a workaround in tooltip, but of course we need something to report it against core
[08:57:11] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: you can't use delegate, you have to bind directly to the container and use closest to filter
[08:57:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: tooltip implements custom event delegation
[08:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> No it doesn't.
[08:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> It uses _on() for focusin.
[08:57:52] <jzaefferer> right, but without a selector
[08:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> Right, I tried that first and it didn't show the problem either.
[08:58:15] <jzaefferer> its not _on("focusin" + items: "open")
[08:58:34] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I see the problem
[08:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/Nb55v/1/
[08:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> Events are only valid during the bubbling phase.
[08:59:07] <jzaefferer> the type changes later?
[08:59:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, event objects are generally reused for special events.
[08:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts on this?
[08:59:46] <jzaefferer> Nice
[09:00:07] <scott_gonzalez> I know it's invalid to call methods on the event asynchronously, but should we keep the state valid?
[09:00:30] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin: testswarm-browserstack is back up. We got a PR updating it to browserstack v2, but that went wrong.
[09:01:08] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: if we didn't shim focusin incorrectly on chrome this wouldn't happen, at least in chrome
[09:01:20] <Krinkle> Found out an hour ago from a notification from Clark. I fixed it, should be running again now.
[09:01:22] <DaveMethvin> but in general, yes we only set the shimmed event name during delivery
[09:01:34] <DaveMethvin> otherwise we'd need to make a complete deep copy of the event
[09:01:49] <DaveMethvin> well maybe it coudl be a shallow copy
[09:03:19] <DaveMethvin> but we don't want to descend into the "nested .originalEvent" hell
[09:03:54] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: nice, or not. How about now to move it to the jQuery organization and taking control?
[09:04:19] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: not that I dislike clarkbox or anything, but he's hardly involved in anything related to our testing infrastructure...
[09:04:30] <Krinkle> There's an open ticket for that (that I support).
[09:04:58] <jzaefferer> I can create the repo in our orga and ping clarkbox about it, give you write access
[09:05:12] <jzaefferer> then we just need to update our clone to look at a different origin
[09:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I think a shallow copy would be fine.
[09:05:39] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: clone to jquery or clone locally and push to jquery?
[09:05:54] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[09:05:55] <Krinkle> (do you want the jquery repo marked as a fork of the one at clarkbox)
[09:06:00] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yep
[09:06:07] <mikesherov> .position() is a funny method.
[09:06:23] <DaveMethvin> .love() is a wonderful thing
[09:06:27] <DaveMethvin> what's your point? :D
[09:06:33] <mikesherov> If the offsetParent is scrolled, .position() reports the scrolled position position relative to the parent
[09:07:02] <mikesherov> i.e., it's not a drop in replacement for .css('left'), and .css('top')
[09:07:19] <mikesherov> so that means two things, I need to back out some of my 1.8 changes that fallback to that
[09:07:27] <mikesherov> and two, just wow
[09:07:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's interesting.
[09:07:41] <DaveMethvin> has it always been like that?
[09:07:54] <DaveMethvin> seems like we'd have gotten some complaints
[09:08:01] <DaveMethvin> or confusion at the very least
[09:08:11] <mikesherov> Well, the API reads the right way
[09:08:29] <mikesherov> and it's confusing enough that's it like the source of 3 bugs (and many dupes) in UI
[09:08:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: actual clone, we generally don't work to the orga account
[09:08:54] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if anyone depends on it being that way
[09:08:59] <jzaefferer> *fork (not work)
[09:09:01] <DaveMethvin> of course someone does
[09:09:12] <DaveMethvin> or compensates for it
[09:09:30] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, any idea when api.jquery.com is going new-style?
[09:09:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ok
[09:09:38] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: UI doesn't :-)
[09:09:49] <DaveMethvin> well where's the bug then? :P
[09:09:55] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: you have to ask kswedberg about that; though considering that we fixed a bunch of grunt-jquery-content issues, it might be pretty close
[09:10:05] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: lets do it then (tw-bs)
[09:10:17] <DaveMethvin> we can fix it in core if it's not going to generate a wave of complaints
[09:10:44] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.resizable.js#L254
[09:10:53] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: it's not an easy fix
[09:11:20] <mikesherov> we'd need to not rely on getBoundingRectClient
[09:11:28] <DaveMethvin> :(
[09:11:35] <mikesherov> I mean, we shouldn't change .position()
[09:12:51] <DaveMethvin> it seems to me that position() *is* the one that's broken though, at least logically
[09:13:16] <mikesherov> well, I mean, not really
[09:13:27] <mikesherov> it records pixel offset from offsetParent
[09:13:42] <mikesherov> it's just a surprise that it's not a drop in for left and top
[09:14:07] <DaveMethvin> in that code, does the element where you are setting top have the same offsetParent?
[09:14:27] <mikesherov> yes
[09:14:54] <mikesherov> imagine you have an element that has css "top:10px; left:10px;"
[09:14:55] <DaveMethvin> then  wouldn't  you expect copying the left/top to put it at the same place?
[09:15:02] <mikesherov> .position reports 10,10 like it should
[09:15:12] <mikesherov> but if the offsetparent is SCROLLED 10px
[09:15:23] <mikesherov> .position reports 0,10
[09:16:28] <mikesherov> because it reports the pixel location relative to the offsetParent
[09:16:48] <mikesherov> if you want the css offsets, .css('top') and .css('left')
[09:17:02] <DaveMethvin> OH, ok
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:18:35] <mikesherov> so, that causes a ton of bugs..http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3635 and it has a duplicate rabbit hole
[09:19:34] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3635#comment:3 if you're interested
[09:21:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah the example makes it clear
[09:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is it worth asking for a CLA and fixing his commit message? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/819
[09:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> I kinda just want to file the bug, and land the fix myself.
[09:37:31] <DaveMethvin> imo, having a commit landed does not mean you need to be in the AUTHORS.txt file
[09:37:40] <DaveMethvin> i brought that up a while back
[09:37:44] <DaveMethvin> i guess it gets subjective
[09:38:04] <DaveMethvin> but yeah this is an example of one that doesn't really deserve "authorship"
[09:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but if we land the commit with his name, then we need the CLA just to make it sane to track.
[09:38:39] <DaveMethvin> i dunno about that
[09:38:59] <DaveMethvin> the only time we have to worry about it is in a legal challenge right?
[09:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise we need to track individual commits that we want to exclude.
[09:39:08] <DaveMethvin> and then we go look up what we landed from that person
[09:39:26] <DaveMethvin> i don't think he's gonna claim ownership of "1"
[09:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, and I validated it against our own code from globalize...
[09:40:07] <DaveMethvin> it just seems like we're gonna get pretty crazy if we can't land something like this without a CLA
[10:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: To answer your question, yes, there's a Panera nearby, but I don't have a car :-/
[10:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> My car is already up in PA, since I'll be driving the truck next week.
[10:55:42] <DaveMethvin> now that's a bandwidth conflict!

[12:48:11] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Tabs: Trigger the select event when collapsing. Fixes #8813 - Tabs: select event not triggering when collapsible:true.
[13:07:01] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: HI! Can I borrow your brain for 2minutes?
[13:09:16] <agcolom> On this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/events.html I'm thinking that it should actually be start and stop (to be consistent with UI)

[13:34:13] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Datepicker: Fixed firstDay in Faroese locale. Fixes #8815 - Datepicker: Faroese locale has incorrect firstDay.
[13:34:13] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Upgrade jQuery to 1.8.3.
[13:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yes, it should.
[14:03:02] <nacin> Looking at jQuery 1.8.3 and UI 1.9.2 for WordPress core. Anything I should know re: timeline and/or seriousness?
[14:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Probably about 2 weeks.

[14:20:23] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Upgrade jQuery to 1.8.3.
[14:20:26] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: Okay. We're releasing WP 3.5 in 21 days. Would like to have 1.9.2 on board, but that'll be too late unfortunately. We have a workaround for the widget bug that bit us.
[14:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> What's the latest you'd need 1.9.2?
[14:21:30] <nacin> I don't think there is anything.
[14:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you said 2 weeks would be too late.
[14:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> What's not too late?
[14:23:16] <nacin> a week, give or take. I can make 2 work if there's not a whole lot of churn.
[14:24:06] <nacin> it's not a big deal, but we just like shipping with the latest whenever possible for ecosystem reasons.
[14:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to get 1.9.2 out next week if I can.
[14:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> It may be tough with Thanksgiving though.
[14:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also moving to PA next week.
[14:25:36] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thx!
[14:25:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: just in time for the cold.
[14:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh, yeah
[14:26:36] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: as long as it doesn't slip beyond two weeks from today, I can likely swing it. but if it misses the boat, it also isn't the end of the world. I was just trying to figure out what the timelines would be.
[14:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.2 fixes a few regressions, so it'd be good to get that in if we can.
[14:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?keywords=~regression&milestone=1.9.2
[14:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> The event prefix bug is the only one that should affect you, but it'd be good for WordPress users to not have those regressions :-)
[14:28:40] <nacin> Oh, totally.
[14:28:45] <nacin> I'll create a tracking ticket and will follow along.
[14:29:06] <nacin> (I rarely follow the meetings, but do read both jQuery's and UI's agendas)
[14:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> My main concerns for 1.9.2 were regressions and bugs in new widgets.
[14:30:54] <scott_gonzalez> We're down to a total of 2 tickets that fall into that category now.
[14:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> So we should be able to release soon.
[14:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> Mya's dance class just ended, gotta go

[18:44:27] <tj_vantoll> Is it just me or does disabling a slider basically make it disappear in all versions of IE http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/R8Jqx/11/show/?
