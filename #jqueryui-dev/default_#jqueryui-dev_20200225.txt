[12:56:43] <jmvanel> Hi!     I have a problem with jquery-ui autocomplete . I move my site to HTTPS; but the completion server (that I don't administrate) is in HTTP. So I did a proxy in my server (also good for HTTP images )
[13:01:10] <jmvanel> So my ajax URL is        var searchServiceURL = "/proxy?originalurl=" + "http://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/PrefixSearch"
[13:02:44] <jmvanel> It *almost* works, but the actual call is:
[13:02:46] <jmvanel> https://localhost:9143/proxy?originalurl=http://lookup.dbpedia.org/api/search/PrefixSearch&QueryString=sophora
[13:03:42] <jmvanel> where the & should be a ?
[13:05:31] <jmvanel> Any idea of a workaround ?
