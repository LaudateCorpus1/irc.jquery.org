[00:01:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ and I discussed removal of style options for 1.5 with the web-ui-fw team. On this wiki page we are going to document the changes before we start making changes in the code https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.5-Style-options-removal
[00:02:11] <arschmitz> ok
[00:02:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think we need to wait i dont see an issue but we are only an hour from release
[00:03:30] <arschmitz> and that will also require a change to authors.txt before we could releaese
[00:03:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you ready with blog post?
[00:04:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am on it now
[00:04:16] <uGoMobi> won't take long
[00:04:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i got change logs run 
[00:04:47] <arschmitz> i just need to clean them up a bit and we can post them later today
[00:04:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you make a PR for adding 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 changelogs?
[00:05:12] <arschmitz> im going to when finish cleaning them up
[00:05:36] <arschmitz> im going to use my time durring the other talks today after mine to finish and do the PR's

[00:16:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope
[00:16:32] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[00:16:35] <arschmitz> it has a new author
[00:16:54] <_|Nix|_> Huh? What does that mean?
[00:16:56] <arschmitz> and i dont want to have to rush commits when we are releaseing in an hour 
[00:17:08] <arschmitz> we would also have to update authors.txt
[00:17:12] <arschmitz> or release will fail
[00:17:28] <_|Nix|_> Oh, I see ... An author who is not in the authors.txt. Gotcha!
[00:17:34] <arschmitz> yup
[00:17:35] <_|Nix|_> I'll re-milestone it to 1.4.3.

[00:50:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz: Android 2.3.x and IE8 were broken in 1.4.1, right?
[00:50:43] <arschmitz> yes
[00:51:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no we generally batch update authors.txt
[00:51:14] <uGoMobi> ok, will say that we fixed it in the blog post
[00:51:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool
[00:53:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, and fixed in 1.4.2.

[01:05:47] <arschmitz> awesome
[01:22:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, so you're actually gonna tag as part of your talk?
[01:22:43] <_|Nix|_> That's insanely cool!
[01:23:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, live release :D
[01:30:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is a livestream http://www.gentics.com/jquery-eu-2014/page/2014/eu.html
[01:31:11] <uGoMobi> looks like arschmitz didn't start yet (or there is a delay in the stream)
[01:40:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ummm ... I'm not seeing any video player-like UI anywhere ... 
[01:40:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: click livestream at the top
[01:40:33] <_|Nix|_> NM. Got it :) Thanks!

[02:10:32] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... I wish issues didn't list PRs or issues fixed by PRs :/
[02:11:25] <uGoMobi> yeah, it's annoying that you can't list issues without PRs
[02:13:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In this sense, trac might be a better system. It has an extensive query language.
[02:19:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's wait for DEBT

[02:20:49] <arschmitz> wifi let me down lol
[02:21:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw it :(
[02:21:09] <arschmitz> oh well not a big deal
[02:21:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was watching the livestream
[02:21:20] <arschmitz> awesome 
[02:21:26] <arschmitz> what did you think?
[02:21:32] <uGoMobi> nice talk
[02:21:33] <arschmitz> i think it was my best yet lol
[02:21:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah you did well
[02:25:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i should have done the release on my server
[02:25:22] <arschmitz> then it would not have depended on wifi
[02:25:35] <arschmitz> next time
[02:25:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah proxy might be better
[02:25:42] <arschmitz> it wouldnt be a proxy
[02:25:49] <arschmitz> i could have just ssh in
[02:25:55] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[02:25:57] <arschmitz> and run it there
[02:26:37] <frequent> arschmitz: nice talk. Finished all my popcorn ;-)
[02:26:43] <uGoMobi> lol
[02:26:43] <arschmitz> lol
[02:28:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is the release script still running or do you have to start over?
[02:28:26] <arschmitz> its still running lol
[02:28:30] <arschmitz> im going to kill it though
[02:28:32] <uGoMobi> holy
[02:28:37] <arschmitz> and run it on better wifi
[02:28:54] <uGoMobi> yeah
[02:29:09] <uGoMobi> only the 56k dial in modem sound is missing ;-)
[02:29:20] <arschmitz> lol
[03:01:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You can still ssh in and run it from there.
[03:01:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great talk, btw!
[03:01:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I already have enough debt. I'd rather not wait for more debt.
[03:03:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[03:04:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What is "DEBT"?
[03:04:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Don't get me wrong. I know the conventional meaning all too well. I just dunno what the acronym stands for in this case :/
[03:05:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: a new issue tracker scott_gonzalez is working on
[03:05:32] <_|Nix|_> Oh, cool!
[03:05:55] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt
[03:07:39] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[04:21:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ping!
[04:21:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: pong
[04:21:31] <arschmitz> im going to try and run the release on server now
[04:21:52] <arschmitz> the wifi here is just not good enough but i got it set to go on server
[04:21:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[04:22:24] <arschmitz> wish i had thought of doing it this way this morning :)
[04:30:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you do not run the release on the server in a screen, the wifi may still hold you up.
[04:30:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Because it will wait to actually display its messages on screen.
[04:30:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its already running in screen
[04:30:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, good.
[04:38:50] <arschmitz> erg NPM!
[04:39:11] <arschmitz> i keep getting an npm error trying to install our dependancies 
[04:40:29] <scottgonzalez> If you need me, ping me on this nick. My laptop is dying :-/
[04:40:38] <arschmitz> oh no....
[04:41:15] <scottgonzalez> I think it's the hard drive.
[04:41:40] <arschmitz> do you have an ssd
[04:41:57] <scottgonzalez> But everything (clicking a button, switching apps, typing a sentence) takes about a minute.
[04:42:00] <scottgonzalez> nope
[04:42:15] <scottgonzalez> I basically get the beach ball of death for every action.
[04:42:39] <uGoMobi> :(
[04:43:14] <scottgonzalez> I'm using my old laptop right now.
[04:44:50] <arschmitz> bummer
[04:46:53] <scottgonzalez> Whoa, is three finger drag new in Mavericks?
[04:47:40] <arschmitz> no
[04:48:20] <arschmitz> you mean between desktops right?
[04:48:38] <scottgonzalez> No, not three finger swipe.
[04:48:51] <scottgonzalez> The equivalent of double-tap-drag
[04:49:04] <arschmitz> oh i have no idea never tried
[04:49:11] <uGoMobi> right, you can drag maps etc with 3 fingers
[04:49:29] <scottgonzalez> System Preferences -> Trackpad. It's a checkbox in the first panel.
[04:50:13] <scottgonzalez> Or the equivalent of the default single-click-hold-drag :-P
[04:50:23] <scottgonzalez> I used to use the double tap drag all the time.
[04:50:29] <scottgonzalez> Looks like that's gone.
[04:51:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you there?
[05:15:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: npm is having issues today
[05:16:56] <scottgonzalez> arschmitz: http://blog.npmjs.org/post/78048834276/elevated-error-rates-2014-02-27
[05:16:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: http://blog.npmjs.org/post/78085451721/npms-self-signed-certificate-is-no-more
[05:17:35] <arschmitz> yeah i just found that
[05:17:39] <arschmitz> uppdating now
[05:17:46] <arschmitz> thank you though :)
[05:23:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:23:54] <arschmitz> i was going to ask you to try something but i figured it out
[05:24:16] <arschmitz> PS npm install wont work anymore if you dont have newest version of npm
[05:24:40] <_|Nix|_> Great ...
[05:24:55] <_|Nix|_> So, does that mean I need to upgrade node?
[05:26:12] <arschmitz> ha
[05:26:19] <arschmitz> so look at uGoMobi link
[05:26:27] <arschmitz> it says to do npm install npm -g 
[05:26:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I just did ... I'm installing npm.
[05:26:36] <arschmitz> but that fails with the very error its supposed to fix
[05:26:41] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:26:44] <arschmitz> at least for me
[05:26:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Mine's still stuck on the get.
[05:27:02] <arschmitz> it will error in a sec
[05:27:14] <_|Nix|_> Blam!
[05:27:53] <uGoMobi> same here
[05:29:10] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm doing both.
[05:29:15] <arschmitz> do the second suggestion
[05:29:19] <arschmitz> then it will work
[05:29:20] <_|Nix|_> I set the CA globally, and now I'm installing npm.
[05:29:29] <arschmitz> yeah thats what i had to do
[05:29:54] <arschmitz> and it worked
[05:54:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still there?
[05:56:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[05:59:50] <arschmitz> can you rm -rf node_modules and then npm install
[05:59:54] <arschmitz> on linux
[05:59:59] <arschmitz> for jquery-mobile
[06:00:05] <arschmitz> see if it fails
[06:02:26] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:03:29] <_|Nix|_> I've already done the CA and the install npm thing. Lessee ...
[06:04:31] <_|Nix|_> I'm backing up the jqm directory so as not to lose my ability to run grunt
[06:04:56] <_|Nix|_> OK, running rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clean && npm install
[06:05:16] <_|Nix|_> So far so good.
[06:05:28] <arschmitz> yeah after that
[06:05:35] <_|Nix|_> It's racing through the packages and none of them are causing problems so far.
[06:05:44] <_|Nix|_> ... and they're all https URLs.
[06:05:54] <arschmitz> ok for me it failed toward the very end on linux
[06:06:06] <arschmitz> but runs fine on osx
[06:06:20] <_|Nix|_> I'm installing phantomjs.
[06:06:34] <_|Nix|_> Now something called "contextify"
[06:06:48] <arschmitz> yup i think thats the fail
[06:06:52] <arschmitz> for me
[06:06:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not for me though.
[06:07:12] <arschmitz> hmm ok differnt linux so who knows
[06:07:18] <_|Nix|_> It's all good up here in not-so-frosty Finland :)
[06:07:18] <arschmitz> this is my server with centos
[06:07:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not so different - Fedora 20.
[06:07:37] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:07:41] <_|Nix|_> I have node 0.10.24
[06:07:50] <_|Nix|_> ... and npm version 1.4.4.
[06:08:02] <arschmitz> im on 10.22
[06:08:10] <arschmitz> and 1.4.4
[06:08:15] <_|Nix|_> Well, ... *shrug*
[06:12:33] <arschmitz> yeah at worst i can have gseguin do the release when he comes on
[06:12:47] <arschmitz> its annoying works fine on laptop but wifi is not good enough
[06:13:00] <arschmitz> and blazing fast on server but npm install for mobile is failing
[06:14:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why don't you upgrade node? If you have lots of processors, it won't take that long.
[06:14:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i tried it said im on latest stable at 0.10.22
[06:15:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: woo got it working
[06:16:13] <arschmitz> nevermind
[06:22:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!

[07:20:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: ah you are talking about a text input in combination with fieldcontain
[07:20:18] <uGoMobi> not sure how the CSS handles that
[07:20:25] <frequent> uGoMobi: yup
[07:20:34] <frequent> this just looks ... not nice :-)
[07:20:44] <frequent> _|Nix|_: thx for the bin
[07:21:05] <uGoMobi> I think the selector only matches label followed by form element
[07:21:48] <frequent> uGoMobi: seems. But ok, so it is "supposed" to look like this.
[07:22:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: let's say I am not surprised it looks like this
[07:22:46] <frequent> uGoMobi: so diplomatic ;-)
[07:22:50] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:23:25] <uGoMobi> I wonder if this was different in 1.3
[07:24:16] <frequent> uGoMobi: not sure... I remember back in 1.2 I had the problem of the same "module" (login) being used on every page of a multipage, so I could not use ids. 
[07:24:16] <uGoMobi> frequent: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/css/structure/jquery.mobile.forms.fieldcontain.css#L45
[07:24:49] <uGoMobi> we would have to add .ui-field-contain > label > [class*="ui-"] selector to make this work
[07:25:18] <frequent> uGoMobi: np. this already helps.
[07:26:08] <uGoMobi> I remember there was an issue once about buttons inside labels
[07:26:17] <frequent> (probably by me)
[07:26:27] <uGoMobi> nah, someone else :)
[07:26:51] <uGoMobi> he wanted an icon only button inside the label for a tooltip
[07:26:55] <frequent> uGoMobi: ah you know all issues and who posted... I have to be careful...
[07:27:01] <uGoMobi> we fixed that
[07:27:04] <frequent> ok
[07:27:17] <uGoMobi> just mentioning it becuase it would probably break again if we add this selector
[07:27:38] <arschmitz> we currently have issues with checkboxes and finding labels i noticed
[07:27:52] <arschmitz> if they are outside page
[07:28:03] <frequent> uGoMobi: For my case, some custom CSS will do.
[07:28:18] <uGoMobi> frequent: great
[07:28:26] <frequent> uGoMobi: thx again
[07:28:44] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[07:45:45] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:46:07] <gseguin> arschmitz: I don't see a release, did something go wrong?
[07:59:56] <gseguin> uGoMobi: what went on?
[08:01:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: problems with wifi and npm
[08:01:15] <gseguin> argh!
[08:01:19] <gseguin> want me to release?
[08:01:55] <uGoMobi> gseguin: can you check with arschmitz 
[08:01:58] <uGoMobi> he was around
[08:02:06] <uGoMobi> not sure about the current status
[08:02:08] <gseguin> arschmitz: ping!
[08:02:10] <uGoMobi> brb

[09:14:29] <uGoMobi> gseguin: hey
[09:14:35] <uGoMobi> gseguin: see the hangout 
[09:29:59] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ready to release
[09:30:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok great
[09:30:22] <gseguin> go?
[09:30:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sure
[09:31:06] <_|Nix|_> Great! Round two: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7195 :/

[09:31:21] <jqcommit> 13jquerymobile.com/06master 147c523b9 15Jasper de Groot: 1.4.10
[09:31:40] <_|Nix|_> I fixed it for dialog, now I get to fix it for the popup as well ...
[09:33:30] <gseguin> it crapped out on me!
[09:42:11] <gseguin> scottgonzalez: are you around?
[09:42:17] <scottgonzalez> yeah
[09:42:32] <gseguin> The release script crapped out on me because of commitplease
[09:42:49] <scottgonzalez> What was the commit message?
[09:43:03] <gseguin> can I force push to code.jquerymobile,com master
[09:43:03] <gseguin> to reset the head?
[09:43:14] <scottgonzalez> why?
[09:43:19] <gseguin> lib/repo.js:217
[09:43:33] <gseguin> because it pushed to the CDN
[09:43:41] <gseguin> and I want to start it again
[09:44:03] <scottgonzalez> I don't think you should be force pushing the CDN.
[09:44:07] <scottgonzalez> gnarf: ^
[09:44:41] <gseguin> won't it complain that the directory already exists if I try doing a release of 1.4.2 again?
[09:45:53] <gseguin> scottgonzalez: ^
[09:46:15] <scottgonzalez> You should just manually finish the release.
[09:46:35] <gseguin> hmm... ok
[09:47:48] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: gseguin: it doesn't really matter RE: force push
[09:48:10] <gnarf> though i'd prefer a revert
[09:48:36] <scottgonzalez> There are other things that would happen though.
[09:48:46] <scottgonzalez> Like deletion and recreation of a tag on jquery-mobile.
[09:48:51] <gnarf> thats bad
[09:48:58] <gseguin> I already deleted the tag
[09:49:03] <gnarf> nooo!!!!
[09:49:04] <gnarf> never
[09:49:07] <gnarf> :)
[09:49:15] <gseguin> it lived less than 3 minutes
[09:49:31] <gnarf> it lived more than 2 seconds and anyone watching for it found it ;)
[09:49:47] <gseguin> true
[09:49:52] <gnarf> then again, like i said to scottgonzalez - no matter how "wrong" it is to delete tags
[09:49:54] <gnarf> people do it
[09:50:46] <gnarf> gseguin: scott would argue that you should just bump the version by another minor if you mucked up the release tag
[09:50:47] <gseguin> I can recreate the exact same tag
[09:50:52] <gseguin> and finish the release manually
[09:50:54] <gnarf> is it a good tag?
[09:50:56] <gnarf> if so do that
[09:51:04] <gnarf> like if there is nothing wrong with the tag, use it
[09:51:09] <gseguin> though I would rather star the script again
[09:51:34] <gnarf> scottgonzalez: can we add a "continue from" to the script?
[09:51:43] <gnarf> or does it already do that
[09:51:48] <scottgonzalez> gnarf: Yes, I already created an issue for it.
[09:51:49] <gseguin> gnarf: I think he's working on it
[09:51:54] <gnarf> +1
[09:52:18] <scottgonzalez> TBH, it's bit kind of frustrating having core and mobile using the release script before it was finished.
[09:52:36] <gnarf> rather than helping finish it? :)
[09:52:45] <gseguin> scottgonzalez: it's fine we're ironing it out
[09:53:06] <gseguin> scottgonzalez: I'm not complaining, I think it's awesome
[09:53:25] <gseguin> scottgonzalez: someone would have hit those bugs eventually
[09:53:41] <gseguin> so what do I do?
[09:53:44] <scottgonzalez> Preferably not while it's holding up actual releases.
[09:54:28] <gseguin> finish releasing manually and readd that tag
[09:54:39] <gseguin> or revert the commit on the CDN and restart the script?
[09:55:06] <gnarf> anywho - RE code.jquery.com repo - push whatever commits to master you want with whatever forcefulness - just don't blow up the CDN by pushing to the initial commit please :) --- I'll let scottgonzalez guide you out of this one gseguin ;)
[09:55:32] <gseguin> thanks gnarf 
[09:55:34] <scottgonzalez> I would manually finish the process, there's not much left.
[09:55:37] <scottgonzalez> But do whatever you want.
[09:55:37] <gnarf> the origin server should stay in sync with force pushes too
[10:19:11] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I generated the changelog
[10:19:19] <gseguin> sending it to you by email
[10:19:25] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks
[10:19:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think arschmitz was working on it, but please send me anyway
[10:20:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: there is a problem with a tag on the jquerymobile.com repo
[10:20:21] <gseguin> hold on, not done with that
[10:20:40] <gseguin> yeah it hasn't been updated
[10:20:48] <gseguin> shite
[10:20:50] <uGoMobi> gseguin: does the release script tag that repo?
[10:21:04] <gseguin> it should because it updates the builder
[10:21:13] <gseguin> but it bailed in the middle
[10:21:27] <uGoMobi> ohw :/
[10:21:51] <gseguin> uGoMobi: How about we declare 1.4.2 DOA and we do 1.4.3 ?
[10:22:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: why?
[10:22:14] <uGoMobi> what is wrong with the release?
[10:22:36] <gseguin> because since the script bailed it did not update the jquerymobile.com repo nor the demos I think
[10:22:48] <gseguin> it was a 2nd commitplease issue
[10:23:01] <uGoMobi> gseguin: then we can still do that, right?
[10:23:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I mean, this is not an issue with the the library or the tag in the library repo, right?
[10:25:24] <gseguin> no, no issue with the bits
[10:31:18] <gseguin> uGoMobi: it'll just make this release simpler I think
[10:32:14] <uGoMobi> hmm
[10:32:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: what's the current status?
[10:32:31] <uGoMobi> has anything be pushed to the CDN?
[10:32:33] <gseguin> uGoMobi: but if that makes you feel uncomfortable I'll fix it
[10:32:36] <uGoMobi> been*
[10:32:43] <gseguin> uGoMobi: the repo is tagged
[10:32:49] <gseguin> the bits are on the cdn
[10:32:57] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:33:08] <gseguin> demos needs to be updated manually
[10:33:09] <uGoMobi> so it's the demos that are the problem?
[10:33:21] <gseguin> and so does the jquerymobile.com repo
[10:33:30] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we can add the demos
[10:34:38] <uGoMobi> what is the problem with jquerymobile.com?
[10:34:57] <uGoMobi> we can build the demos and add them, then tag again
[10:35:01] <uGoMobi> or is it not that simple?
[10:38:36] <gseguin> yup
[10:45:26] <gseguin> uGoMobi: demos is updated
[10:45:33] <gseguin> uGoMobi: working on jquerymobile.com
[10:45:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: awesome
[10:48:08] <uGoMobi> gseguin: my last commit only changed the version to 1.4.10 in the package.json
[10:48:30] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the 1.4.10 tag already existed so that was rejected

[12:56:41] <DaliusK> hi, can I report an performance bug here? :)
[13:04:51] <_|Nix|_> DaliusK: Is it a UI bug or a mobile bug?
[13:05:10] <DaliusK> UI
[13:05:42] <_|Nix|_> DaliusK: Then your best bet is http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
