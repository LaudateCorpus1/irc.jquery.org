[02:56:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[02:56:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong
[02:57:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! Trying to land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6719 (the touch PR) and I'm realizing that, while it claims to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5983, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5983 is a PR itself, and is already closed.
[02:57:23] <_|Nix|_> So, I can't really write Fixes gh-???? anywhere.
[02:57:35] <_|Nix|_> At most I can write Re gh-5983.
[02:58:14] <_|Nix|_> So, if I were to push this commit to master and 1.4-stable, it wouldn't have any Fixes gh-????.
[02:58:22] <_|Nix|_> Is that OK?
[02:58:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: open a ticket for the issue first
[02:58:41] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'll do that.
[02:58:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and close it with the commit
[02:59:07] <_|Nix|_> I'll copy the comment from the PR description.
[02:59:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, sounds good
[03:01:17] <_|Nix|_> We don't have a component for events, only a tag.
[03:01:26] <_|Nix|_> What component should I put in the commit message?
[03:01:39] <_|Nix|_> "Touch"? "Events"?

[06:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Do you know if anyone is looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7483?
[06:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> There are some bad tests that pass with old QUnit (it wasn't strict about assertions running ouside of a test and incorrectly using start/stop).
[06:21:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: not yet
[06:21:49] <arschmitz> we are trying to finish up some stuff to release 1.4.3 on monday
[06:22:23] <arschmitz> breaking our tests seemed like it should maybe wait till after that :)
[06:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[06:23:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: unless its holding you back on the license updates then i can make time today
[06:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> It is holding that up, but I can see if there's a version that includes a license and isn't so strict.
[06:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> Testing with 1.12.0 right now. It's the first vesion that includes the license.
[06:27:19] <arschmitz> ok
[06:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[06:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> Testing http://localhost:9885/tests/integration/degrade-inputs/ F
[06:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> >> jquery.mobile.degradeInputs.js - should degrade input type to a different type, as specified in page options
[06:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> >> Message: Expected undefined assertions, but 26 were run
[06:29:22] <arschmitz> hmm thats a plain broken test that quint is letting pass i think
[06:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> So far that's the only failure, so that's good.
[06:30:51] <arschmitz> from your paste it looks like somehow undefined is getting passed to the expect 
[06:34:47] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think i see the problem

[06:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting other failres too.
[06:39:39] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: could be more legit failures
[06:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're all going to be legit failures.
[06:40:18] <arschmitz> well onless there was an api change
[06:40:32] <scott_gonzalez> No required API changes.
[06:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit just does a better job of checking for bad tests now.
[06:41:00] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: cool
[06:41:27] <_|Nix|_> I can pitch in on fixing the tests.
[06:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: That'd be great.
[06:42:02] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that degrade inputs one we said expect object.length tests
[06:42:16] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: but then do $.each on it and run 2 tests in each loop lol
[06:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it might just be two tests, actually.
[06:42:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'd like to pull your PR into a branch and push test-fixing commits on top.
[06:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: That's fine.
[06:43:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i already have the degrade inputs one
[06:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> The other failure is probably similar.
[06:47:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah this one was passing because we were passing undefined to the expect
[06:47:58] <arschmitz> so it allowed any number

[06:50:38] <_|Nix|_> I'll look at the navigation tests.
[06:55:24] <_|Nix|_> Oh, d00d ... I'm getting navigation test failures ... like, the page is right there, but it's not going to it.
[06:56:14] <_|Nix|_> Also, WTF?! We have paths hard-coded for running under phantomjs?!
[06:56:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well in the degrade inputs one when i go to the pr its loading page before any of its dep's
[06:57:03] <arschmitz> i dont get it and its being done by require

[06:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> The build was fixed ^ Maybe rebase the PR?
[06:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Why don't you push the expected count fix to master and then I'll rebase my PR and push it again.
[06:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> That should at least get us down to one test failure (hopefully).
[06:59:49] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: because that test is super broken lol require is loading things all out of order
[07:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> Is it super broken in master too?
[07:00:18] <arschmitz> yes
[07:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> We could just comment it out and file an issue.
[07:00:31] <arschmitz> it was only passing because of the qunit bug about undefined
[07:00:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I did for the one horribly broken jquery-color test.
[07:00:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: it should only take me a minute its just something with require
[07:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:05:20] <_|Nix|_> There's also the branch I created: 7483-fix-qunit
[07:05:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok weird
[07:05:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so all the tests in your branch seem like they are failing in the browser but passing on command line
[07:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> They fail on the command line.
[07:06:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the navigation tests are failing in both.
[07:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> They fail locally and in Travis.
[07:06:30] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[07:06:41] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: no not the ones you mentioned
[07:06:43] <arschmitz> ALL
[07:06:53] <_|Nix|_> Also, the documentation for the parameter to Qunit.start() is super-incomprehensible to me: http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.start/
[07:06:59] <arschmitz> the ones you mentioned are failing both
[07:07:04] <_|Nix|_> "Optional argument to merge multiple start() calls into one. Use with multiple corresponding stop() calls."
[07:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's for when you call .stop() multiple times before calling .start()
[07:07:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, I think that's a problem.
[07:07:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: One of our tests is start( 1000 )
[07:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> Like if you did $.each( arr, function() { stop() // do stuff } ); start( 5 )
[07:07:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK.
[07:08:05] <_|Nix|_> I don't think we have that.
[07:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> Generally, you shouldn't ever need it.
[07:08:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, we almost never call stop(). We just use asyncTest() which does it for you.
[07:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like an indicator of a bad test if you're passing a value to start().
[07:08:54] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think whoever wrote that thought that the number meant that it should start after that many milliseconds.
[07:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[07:09:14] <_|Nix|_> I may be wrong, of course. I'll remove the parameter.
[07:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> We had issues in old Firefox when we used to do setTimeout( start )
[07:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> And Firefox used to pass the number of ms difference between when the timeout should be called and when it was called.
[07:10:53] <_|Nix|_> OK, navigation's looking better now.
[07:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:11:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do me a favor try to run collapsible integration tests in chrome
[07:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> Once we have this working, I can work on the *real* PR :-P
[07:12:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: On it.
[07:12:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Works fine.
[07:12:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No errors in console.

[07:43:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, could you push your fix to the branch 7483-fix-qunit? That way, I can run the tests with your fix in place.
[07:43:42] <_|Nix|_> ... which should make the test suite be green at least on the command line.
[07:45:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah give me a sec to remove the 30,000 console logs iv added lol

[07:52:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it was working on the polymer pointer evets branch
[07:52:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that polyfill cant run in phantom
[07:57:06] <_|Nix|_> Found an error in controlgroup.
[07:57:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hm suprised i didnt find and file that one
[07:57:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh was it integration?
[07:57:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i only made it through unit
[07:58:20] <_|Nix|_> No, it was unit, but it's most likely due to the new qunit
[07:58:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's fine in master.
[07:58:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh ok
[07:59:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i think all the issues i filed are fixed
[07:59:30] <arschmitz> so master unit tests should be clean in chrome
[08:11:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Found a few more 404s among the integration tests. I think I'll fix them in this pass.
[08:12:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good i want to clean the tests up a lot
[08:19:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A genuine failure in tests/integration/navigation in Chrome: jquery.mobile.navigation.js: page last scroll distance is remembered while navigating to and from pages
[08:20:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not sure thats a failure we changed that behivor
[08:20:34] <arschmitz> it should ALWAYS remember now regardless of distance even only 1 px
[08:20:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, either way, it's passing in phantomjs, but not in Chrome.
[08:22:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im just saying it might be a changed assumption
[08:24:50] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that's true.
[08:36:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[08:39:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[08:39:39] <_|Nix|_> I just got through all the tests.
[08:39:47] <arschmitz> just a sec might have figured it out
[08:45:23] <_|Nix|_> Well, I don't think I can make the base tests have jqm-tests.css and swarminject.js, because the whole point is that they mess with the base.
[08:46:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well we dont even test on test swarm lol
[08:47:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah ...

[09:07:01] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[09:07:03] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[09:07:42] <_|Nix|_> How do we do the PR? I should make a second PR that lands the branch and closes scott_gonzalez's PR.
[09:07:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[09:07:59] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[09:08:10] <_|Nix|_> I'm still missing your degrade-inputs fix.
[09:08:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you just blew it away lol
[09:08:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, crap! I'm an idiot.
[09:08:42] <_|Nix|_> So sorry!
[09:09:09] <_|Nix|_> I can still recover it, I think, lemme try.
[09:13:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just pushed it again

[09:14:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Alright, I guess it's not worth wasting time over trying to grab an orphaned commit from the remote repo.
[09:14:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: None of the SO answers worked, anyway
[09:14:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it was a one line change so not exactly hard to just reapply
[09:15:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just pulled your changes went back to my editor ctrl+z and commited again and pushed lol
[09:15:44] <_|Nix|_> Still curious though, and now I have some time to mess around while the tests run.
[09:15:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: A sound plan.
[09:16:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i use that trick a lot
[09:16:38] <_|Nix|_> I've also used it a couple of times.
[09:16:44] <arschmitz> because i will do something i wanted to be on a previous commit 
[09:16:48] <arschmitz> so i rebase to the commit
[09:16:52] <arschmitz> the changes go away
[09:17:06] <arschmitz> but then i can just ctrl+z and they come back lol
[09:17:42] <arschmitz> normally when updating a pr based on review comments
[09:18:02] <arschmitz> get overzealous and just do right then and then be like shoot this should have been on a previous commit
[09:18:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i could just as easily do a commit then rebase change order and mark fixup
[09:19:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I find myself pushing things down to older commits with rebase/fixup a lot too.
[09:20:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or ^Z-ing all my changes, then redoing part of them, committing, redoing some more, committing, redoing the rest, committing.
[09:20:43] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah many ways
[09:21:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i started sometimes using like squash or fixup etc as my component lol
[09:21:41] <_|Nix|_> OK. I gotta go. I'll do the PR after the tests complete.
[09:22:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok see you later
[09:35:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm back. Just wolfed down some dinner.
[09:39:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Tests are green, so I'm making that PR.

[10:46:39] <_|Nix|_> So, do I just squash everything into scott_gonzalez's commit?
[10:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think the individual commits are fine.
[10:47:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nah they are all seperate issues good to have history on them
[10:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> Though you'd probably want to move my commit to the end.
[10:47:22] <arschmitz> yeah what scott_gonzalez said lol
[10:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> So that the each commit still results in passing tests.
[10:47:36] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: oh good point or it will be broken
[10:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> Even if the tests are passing wrongly.
[10:48:04] <_|Nix|_> OK, I'll rearrange them.
[10:48:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thanks!

[10:51:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1447/edit actually
[10:52:54] <_|Nix|_> Very nice!
[10:53:11] <_|Nix|_> How come the second one cannot be collapsed?
[10:53:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so im going to put that in a branch it just needs a little cleanup
[10:53:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its an option
[10:53:35] <_|Nix|_> I see.
[10:53:54] <arschmitz> the first one has it set to true
[10:53:57] <arschmitz> the second one does not
[10:54:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and these animations run smoothly on all our supported devices?
[10:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Why do you use two different SHAs for UI files?
[10:54:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: just when they were added
[10:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> You should always use a single version.
[10:55:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to switch these to 1.11.0-beta.2
[10:55:40] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we need to switch to using the ones from 1.11
[10:55:43] <arschmitz> yeah that lol
[10:56:00] <_|Nix|_> Are we gonna have this._classes() in time for 1.5.0? Just curious ...
[10:56:05] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we will have to update our require shims
[10:56:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: unlikely 
[10:56:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: zero chance unless we used an unreleased widget factory
[10:56:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: which is unlikely
[10:56:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That would not be unprecedented.
[10:57:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... we could also add it to js/widget.js
[10:57:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no but we want to avoid it
[10:57:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we shouldnt not do that
[10:57:29] <arschmitz> execpt without the double negative
[10:58:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but we already use the classes option in a bunch of places, so, if I were to implemented it right, as you suggested in the table review PR, I'd be reproducing a bunch of the code from UI anyway.
[10:58:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: bunch of places === table and panel, IIRC.
[10:58:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah we really should not have done that but too late now
[10:59:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we also dont use it correctly
[10:59:15] <_|Nix|_> That's right, and the keys in the classes option are documented.
[10:59:18] <arschmitz> its supposed to map structural class to theme classes 
[10:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[10:59:50] <_|Nix|_> Just more deprecation 's all ...
[11:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we can't ship UI 1.11.0 with our bower.json.
[11:02:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so ... can I leave the classes keys as they are, or should I change them?
[11:02:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do we have any browsers left that don't support property accessors?
[11:03:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It'd really help us to use those when we rename things like that.
[11:03:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: does ie8?
[11:03:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess that's the only iffy one.
[11:03:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and yes just leave them for now
[11:03:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: also check android 2.3
[11:04:51] <_|Nix|_> Well, if I leave them, I leave them. I'm not gonna bother checking for property accessors then.
[11:05:48] <_|Nix|_> Though maybe I should, because we've already had a bunch of places where we had to check two different keys on two different objects, one of which is deprecated.
[11:05:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: well its not a bad thing to know lol
[11:06:00] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[11:09:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: According to MDN, re IE: 9 (8, but only on DOM objects and with some non-standard behaviors. See below.)
[11:09:52] <_|Nix|_> :/
[11:09:59] <arschmitz> so yeah no go
[11:10:53] <_|Nix|_> *sigh*
[11:11:25] <_|Nix|_> So, whenever we drop IE8 ...
[11:11:46] <arschmitz> 2020
[11:16:13] <scott_gonzalez> That's two years sooner than HTML5 will be ready :-P

[11:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like the answer was "Yes, some browsers are broken, even though caniuse doesn't say so"
[11:24:14] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i feel like your right because according to caniuse we can but this JUST cameup like a week or two ago 
[11:25:09] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: though even bens site says we dont need it

[11:25:57] <arschmitz> on master thats fine
[11:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> Cool.

[11:35:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's certainly possible.
[11:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> There's a woman in Panera that has been here all day. She was here all day when I was here last week too.

[11:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure she's a student because one of the books has a Drexel University stamp on it.

[13:32:21] <arschmitz> oh i see the commit
[13:33:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe in selectmenu and popup make sure you get exactly one pagecontainerbeforechange for open and one for close
[13:33:33] <arschmitz> and only those
[13:34:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[13:34:28] <_|Nix|_> I've finished cleaning up the tests, BTW.
[13:34:41] <_|Nix|_> ... all except for the "genuine" nav failure.
[13:34:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: awesome
[13:37:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've added CSS to move fixed headers to never-neverland, the way we move pages to never-neverland (top: -10000px;), but I can't do it for footers, because if I say top: -10000px, then the footer will stretch from the bottom of the window until -10000px;
[13:38:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so, there are some things I can't fix.
[13:38:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i have no idea what your talking about lol
[13:38:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Fixed headers appear on top of the qunit-fixture.
[13:38:58] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[13:39:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I added css to jqm-tests.css to move them to top: -10000px;
[13:39:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We already do that with pages.
[13:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> Can't you just use bottom instead of top for the footers?
[13:39:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok for footer cant you just do height:0 width:0 in 
[13:40:05] <arschmitz> the test css
[13:40:19] <_|Nix|_> Well, I don't want to affect the height of the footer, nor set it to some fixed value, because it's supposed to be as tall as its contents.
[13:40:20] <arschmitz> i dont think any tests check size
[13:40:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh right so just width 0
[13:40:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because we dont need it perfect just dont want it to hide tests
[13:41:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait a sec ... width is set to 100%, but I can set the left to 100% as well, and then it'll be in the right margin.
[13:41:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whatever works like i said i just dont want it to hide the tests
[13:41:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or, better to shove it in the left margin, because that doesn't add to the horizontal scrollbar.
[13:42:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it doesn't actually hide the tests, because we don't have that many tests, and they don't reach the footer - yet.
[13:42:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but yeah, for completeness sake I will move the footer into the left margin if I can.
[13:43:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[13:45:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: One other minor thing: During the course of running tests/integration/fixed-toolbar/index.html, the page is made intentionally very tall so that you can scroll it, and it jumps to somewhere in the middle a couple of times, scrolling the tests out of view. At the end of the run, it returns to 0 though, so they're visible after completion.
[13:45:18] <_|Nix|_> I don't think I can prevent that.
[13:46:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats fine
