[07:17:42] <tj_vantoll> Polymer has a concept of super() built in: https://github.com/tjvantoll/ui-web-components/commit/231284d67163495b58ffcad1a3658b57d44e8c8d.
[07:17:56] <tj_vantoll> The custom elements spec, however, does not.
[08:14:42] <tj_vantoll> Polymer doesn't like wrapping custom elements with new elementsâ€¦ at all. I don't think I can feasibly port dialog without fundamentally changing the structure.
[08:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:05:56] <tj_vantoll> Actually it looks like Polymer's "attached" callback is called whenever a custom element is attached to the DOM OR moved. So when I moved the dialog DOM element into the wrapper, the attached callback fired, causing an infinite loopâ€”in a very difficult to debug way. Fun times.
[09:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[09:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the problem is that browsers generally don't differentiate moving in the DOM and removing/adding.
[09:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> We've complained about that before and the response we got was "it's too difficult to do right"

[09:45:37] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: I got the web-ui-fw API docs mostly working without jquery-wp-content, and you were right, it greatly reduces the need for post-mirror processing: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/web-ui-fw-api-docs/local.xyzzy/hsvpicker/index.html
[09:45:57] <gabriel_schulhof> scott_gonzalez: Is it OK if I copy the code for generating the iframe for the examples?
[09:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:46:33] <gabriel_schulhof> Awesome! Thanks!
[09:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> Site looks good.
